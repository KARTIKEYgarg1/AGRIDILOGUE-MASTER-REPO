World Cotton Day 2023 - Making cotton fair and sustainable for all: from farm to fashion

Cotton is the most important of the natural fibres, used daily in apparel and home furnishings. Cotton is a critical means of livelihood for millions of smallholders and their families by providing employment and income. It represents an important source of export revenues for some of the poorest countries in the world. Cotton is one of the most common fabrics in our wardrobes. It is comfortable, hypoallergenic, breathable and durable. But cotton represents so much more than just a commodity. This natural fabric is a life-changing product worldwide that sustains 32 million growers (almost half of them women) and benefits over 100 million families across 80 countries in 5 continents.

The World Cotton Day offers a unique opportunity to renew the commitment to a sustainable cotton sector for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life, leaving no one behind. This year's theme aims to raise visibility of the cotton sector and awareness of the critical role that it plays in economic development, international trade and poverty alleviation. The observance also aims to highlight the importance of sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.

The annual event aims to
Give exposure and recognition to cotton and all its stakeholders in production, transformation and trade.
Engage donors and beneficiaries and strengthen development assistance for cotton.
Seek new collaborations with the private sector and investors for the cotton-related industries and production in developing countries.
Promote technological advances, as well as further research and development on cotton.
