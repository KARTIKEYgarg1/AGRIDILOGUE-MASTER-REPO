Agri Export Zones


The  concept of Agri Export Zone (AEZ) was introduced in 2001, through EXIM  Policy 1997-2001, to take a comprehensive look at a particular  produce/product located in a contiguous area for the purpose of  developing and sourcing the raw materials, their processing/packaging,  leading to final exports.

The concept hinged primarily on convergence of  existing Central and State Government schemes to take care of financial  interventions required at various stages of value chain; partnership  among various stakeholders viz. Central Government, State Government,  farmer, processor, exporter etc.; and focus on targeted products and  areas to identify required policy interventions.

Measures  to  promote  exports  from  Agri  Export   Zone

A. Financial Assistance


Both  Central  as  well  as  State  Government  and  their   agencies provide  a  variety  of  financial  assistance   to various agri export related activities. 
These  extend  from  providing  financial  assistance  for   Training   and   Extension,   R&amp;D,   Quality   Upgradation,    Infrastructure and Marketing etc.
Central  government  Agencies  like  APEDA,  NHB,  Deptt.   of  Food  Processing  Industries,  Ministry  of  Agriculture   provide  assistance,  a  number  of  State  Governments   have also extended similar facilities. 
All   these   facilities   are   dovetailed   and   extended   to    promote  agri  exports  from  the  proposed  Zones  in  a   coordinated manner. 
Some  additional  features  like  providing  grants  from   Market Access Initiative fund. 

B. Fiscal Incentives 


The   benefits   under   Export   Promotion   Capital    Goods Scheme provided  to   service exporters in the Agri Export zones. 
Even service provided to ultimate exporters will be  eligible    for    import    of    capital    goods    at    a     concessional   duty   for   setting   up   of   common    facilities.   They  shall  fulfil  their  export  obligation  through   receipt    of    foreign    exchange    from    ultimate     exporters who shall make the payments from their  EEFC account.
