Spices Board had introduced e-Auction of Cardamom in       Bodinayakanur, Theni Dist, Tamilnadu in August 2007. This e-Auction centre has forty buyer terminals. The second e-Auction centre was established in Vandanmettu, Idukki, Kerala in Dec 2007 with sixty terminals. The e-Auction had replaced the traditional outcry auctions of Cardamom in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

In the new system, licensed dealers are provided with a user id and  password. The dealers have to log into the system  to participate in an Auction. A bid is made with  key depressions using a normal computer keyboard. Identity of bidders is protected during the auction process. Highest bidder’s name is displayed only on the Auction Masters’ terminal. There is a main display board showing lot no, quantity, number of bags current highest bid etc of each lot kept in the Auction.

The e-Auction system has brought transparency in the auction process. The system is running successfully in both centres.
