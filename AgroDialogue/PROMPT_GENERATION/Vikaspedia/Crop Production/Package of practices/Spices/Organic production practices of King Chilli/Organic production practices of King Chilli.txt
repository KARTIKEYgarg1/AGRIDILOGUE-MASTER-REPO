Nursery Raising


The medium of nursery bed - Vermicompost,  garden soil, sand (1:1:1 by volume) 
Seed treatment - hot water treatment @ 45-500C   for 30 minutes, drain the excess water and treat with Trichoderma virdi or Trichoderma  harzianum and dry in shade for 30 minutes.
Sowing of seeds - The seed can be sown in bed/ small poly bags/ disposable cups at 1-2 inch depth.
Time of sowing  - seed can be sown in First week of January to second week of February. 
Nursery should be watered after every alternate day or when it is too dry. 
Damping off is the disease that comes at nursery stage but seed treatment with Trichoderma virdi or Trichoderma harzianum will prevent not only damping off but many other diseases also.

Transplantation

Land preparation for transplanting 

Field should be well prepared after ploughing to fine tilth. Well rotten FYM/ vermicompost should be applied in pits / hole (@ 4-5 ton /ha) 1 week before transplanting and expose it to sun. The seedlings can be transplanted at the spacing of 75 cm x75 cm. 45-60 days old seedlings are recommended for transplanting. Transplanting can be done in April/ May after onset on monsoon.

 Watering 

Seedlings should be watered immediately after transplanting or can be transplanted on a rainy day and as and when required.

Weeding

Plant protection measures

Naga king chilli is attacked by many diseases and pests.

Diseases

Anthracnose and fruit rot

It is a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum capsici. Necrosis of twigs from tip downwards occures. Spots on fruits usually sunken with black margins can also be seen.

Seed treatment with Tichoderma (@10g/kg seed) is recommended.



Symptoms of Anthracnose in Naga king chilli

Leaf curl of chilli (Tobacco leaf curl virus)

Leaves become small in size, plants become stunted and poor with no bearing of fruits.

Uproot and burn infested plants. Early Spray of Neem Oil @ 5ml/litre of water or spray Dipole (a biopesticide) @ 1-4 teaspoon / 4 litres water to control white fly which is vector for transmission of viral disease. Growing resistant varieties also is useful for prevention.

Bacterial wilt and Bacterial leaf spot of chilli 

It is caused by Ralstonia solanacearum.

Disease management


The seeds may be treated with Trichoderma and Psuedomonas sp. @ 10 g per kg of seed to prevent diseses.
Careful seed selection and adoption of phytosanitary measures will check the diseases of chilli. 
Early removal of affected plants will control the spread of the  diseases. 
Varieties tolerant to diseases should be used wherever the  disease is severe. 
Rouging and destruction of affected plants help in checking the  mosaic virus. 
For effective disease control, 10 g of Trichoderma or  Pseduomonas sp. per litre of water should be used for spraying.

Insects

The aphids, spider mites and fruit borer are the major insects.



Insects management - spray of Neem oil @ 5 ml/liter of water after fruit setting to avoid the larval stage of fruit borer and control the aphid population at Economic Threshold Level.
