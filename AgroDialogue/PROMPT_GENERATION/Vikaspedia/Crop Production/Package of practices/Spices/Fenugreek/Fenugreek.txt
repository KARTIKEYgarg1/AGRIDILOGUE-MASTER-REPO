Fenugreek


Fenugreek (Methi) is an annual herb mainly cultivated for seed as well as for its leaves (fresh or dried). The seeds are used as a spices and condiments to improve the flavor and the nutritive value of foods. Seed have strong odor and slight bitterness in taste. Seeds are used as seasoning agent for pickles and vegetable. Fenugreek is an important seed spice, native of South Eastern Europe and South Western Asia. India is also said to be one of the natives of fenugreek.

India occupies prime position among fenugreek growing country in the world. Rajasthan alone produces more than 80% fenugreek of the country, besides other growing states are Gujarat, , Chattisgarh and .

Climate

It is cool season crop. The areas where rains are  heavy and continuous, growing methi should be avoided.

Soil

A rich well drained loamy soil is best suited for fenugreek cultivation. The favorable soil pH is 6-7.

Season

June - July and October - November

Seed rate

12 kg/ha is required

Seed treatment

Treated with Azospirillum 1.5 kg/ha +  Trichoderma viride @ 50 g/ha for 12 kg of seeds.

Field preparation and sowing


Prepare the main field to a fine tilth.
Add FYM 20 - 25 t/ha before last ploughing. Form beds and channels  of 3.5 x 1.5 m.
Seeds are sown at a spacing of 20 X 15 cm. Spray pre-emergence  herbicide Fluchloralin 700 ml in 500 lit of water per ha.

Manuring

Basal - FYM 20 - 25 t/ha and N,  P, K at 30:25:40 kg/ha.

Top dressing - 20 kg of N at 30 days after sowing.

Irrigation

First irrigation is given immediately after sowing,   second on the third day and subsequently at 7 - 10 days intervals.

After cultivation

Plants are thinned at 20 - 25 days after sowing and  the  thinned seedlings are used as greens. One pinching at a height of about  4”  will encourage branching.Weeding  is done as and when necessary.

Plant protection

Diseases Root rot: Root rot can be controlled by soil application of  Neem cake @ 150 g/ha and seed treatment with Trichoderma viride @  4g/kg  of seed and drenching with  Carbendazim 0.5 g/l or Copper oxychloride 2 g/litre.   Powdery mildew: Dust  Sulphur at 25 kg/ha or foliar spray with wettable sulphur 2 g/lit at the time  of appearance of disease.

Common Methi ( Trigonella foenum gracum ) cultivation in Jammu

 

Climate

It is cool season crop and can tolerate frost and freezing weather. The areas where rains are  heavy and continuous, growing methi should be avoided.

Soil 

Methi  can  be  grown  on  a  wide  range  of  soils.  The  ideal  soil  for  methi  is  clay  loam.  The   favorable soil pH is 6-7.

Varieties

Pusa Early Bunching : It is an early cultivar commonly known as methi. It takes about 125 days  from seed to seed.

 Manures and Fertilizers


 FYM  (t/ha) - 15 ; N (Urea) kg/ha - 60 (120.0) ; P2O5 (DAP) kg/ha - 20 (44.0) ; K2O (MOP)  kg/ha - 20 (34.0)
 Apply  whole  FYM,  phosphorus,  potash  and  1/4t h  N  at  the  time  of  sowing  and  remaining   nitrogen @20 kg/ ha after every cutting to  get green, tender and succulent leaves. 

Intercultural operations 

Two  hoeing  and  weedings  are  enough  to  control  the  weeds.  Pre-plant  application  of   Trifluralin (Treflan) @ 0.75 kg/ha along with one hand weeding keeps weed under check.

Irrigation 

The first irrigation is given immediately after  sowing and subsequently after every 8-10 days.  Avoid water stress at pod and seed development stage.

Harvesting 

When common methi is used as leafy vegetable, the young shoots are nipped off in about one  month  after  sowing.  The  picking  of  leaves  is   done  by  nipping  2cm  above  ground  level  leaving   the stubs which produces new shoots. Avg. yield is 70-80 q/ha.

Fenugreek seed production 

The methi is raised for seed production in the same way as for green leaves production. After  one  month  of  sowing  one-two  cutting  of  green  leaves  should  be  taken  and   then  crop  is  left  for   raising  seed.  After  one  cutting  20  kg  N/ha  and  then   irrigate  the  field.  Methi  is  predominantly  a   self pollinated and an isolation distance of 10 and 5 m should be maintained for foundation and  certified  seed  production.  Crop  is  ready  for  seed   harvest  when  pods  turn  brown  and  leaves  get   dry. Green leaves yield:   70-80q/ha  ; Seed Yield:  15-19q/ha

Kasuri Methi (Trigonella corniculata) in Jammu

 Climate

Kasuri  methi  requires  a  relatively  cooler  climate.  It  can  tolerate  frost  and  freezing  weather.   The areas where rains are heavy and continuous, growing methi should be avoided.

Harvesting 

The  crop  is  meant  for  flavor  and  aroma.  It  is  dried  as  spice  crop.  The  green  leaf  yield  of   Kasuri type vary from 90-100q/ha while the  common type produces an yield of 70-80q/ha.

Kasuri methi seed production 

The crop is raised for seed production in th e same way as for green leaves production. After  one  month  of  sowing  one-two  cutting  of  green  leaves  should  be  taken  and   then  crop  is  left  for   raising  seed.
