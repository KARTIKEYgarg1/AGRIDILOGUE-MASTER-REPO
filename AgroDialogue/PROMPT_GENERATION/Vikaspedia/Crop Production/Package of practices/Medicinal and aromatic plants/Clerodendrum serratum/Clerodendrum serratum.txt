Agro-technique

Nursery Technique


Raising Propagules: The stem cuttings are raised in polybags in the month of May and after establishing, the same may be transferred to the field.
Propagule Rate and Pretreatment: Stem cutting to be treated in IBA 400 ppm for early sprouting.

Planting in the Field


Land Preparation and Fertilizer Application: Ploughing and harrowing of field is done to bring the soil to fine tilth. Pits of 60X60X60 cm are prepared and organic manure (FYM) is mixed with NPK 75:75:75 gm per pit should be applied before transplanting the sprouted cuttings.
Transplanting and Optimum Spacing: The stem cuttings are raised in polybags and after establishing the same may be transferred in the field at 2.0X2.0 meter spacing during rainy season.
Interculture and Maintenance Practices: Weeding should be done as and when required.
Irrigation Practices: In winter irrigation has to be given at 30-40 days interval and during summers at 10- 20 days interval.
Control: 2-3 manual weedings per annum are required.
Disease and Pest Control: Formation of sooty larval and mealy bugs is observed and can be controlled through use of suitable pesticides.

Harvest Management


Crop Maturity and Harvesting: Flowering takes place in next summer season and root could be dug out in autumn viz.18 months age or over.
Post-harvest Management: Shade drying of roots is desirable.
Chemical Constituents: Root-bark yields saponine, mannitol and stigmasterol.
Yield : 1.5-2.0 t/ha on dry basis.
