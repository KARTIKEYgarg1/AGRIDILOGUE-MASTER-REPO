Sword Bean




Sword bean (Canavalia gladiata L.) is a tropical under-utilized food legume. It is rich in proteins and is cultivated as a vegetable and fodder crop.

Sword bean is wildly distributed in the Eastern and Western Ghats of South India and also cultivated  as  a  fodder  crop  in  Northern  and  Peninsular  India.

It  has  many  desirable  agronomic  features  such  as  high  biomass  production,  resistance  to  drought,  pest  and  diseases,  high  fertility  index  and  high  seed  productivity on  fertile  land, which  enable them to grow well under tropical condition.

The seeds  are  not  extensively  utilized  as  food/feed  mainly  due  to  the  presence  of  certain  antinutritional  compounds such   as   total   free   phenolics,   tannins,  Concanavalin  A  (Con  A)  lectin,  L-Canavanine  (a  non-protein  amino  acid),  phytic  acid,  oligosaccharides,  protease  inhibitors  and  Î±-amylase  inhibitors.

Season

June - July (Rainfed), September - October (Rabi), February - March (Summer). It can be grown throughout the year and gives good response to irrigation.

Seeds and sowing

There are two types of sword bean. White seeded varieties are bushy in nature whereas red seeded varieties are trailed over pandals.

Pole type varieties are to be planted at a spacing of 4 x 3 m whereas bush type varieties are to be planted at 60 x 60 cm. May-June and September-October are the usual sowing time and the seed rate followed is one or two seeds per pit. This can also be grown as border crop, intercrop and a shade crop.

SBS 1 is a variety of Sword bean grown in .

Nutrient management

FYM is applied at the rate of 5 t/ha. The N:P2O5: K2O mixture (7:10:5) may be applied as basal dose and top dressing at several splits.

Harvesting and yield

Sword bean matures in 110 - 120 days. Tender pods are ready for harvest from 75 days after sowing. As a pure crop it gives an average grain yield of 1356 kg/ha and green pod yield of 7500 kg/ha.
