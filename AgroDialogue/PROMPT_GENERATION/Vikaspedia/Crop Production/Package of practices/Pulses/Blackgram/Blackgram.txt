Blackgram


Black gram (Vigna Mungo L.), is one of the important  pulses crop, grown throughout  the country.  The crop is resistant to adverse  climatic conditions and improve the soil fertility  by  fixing  atmospheric  nitrogen  in  the  soil.     It  has  been  reported  that  the  crop  produces   equivalent to 22.10 kg  of N/ha., which has been estimated  to be supplement of 59 thousand  tonnes of urea annually.  The pulse 'Black gram' plays an important role in Indian diet, as it  contains  vegetable  protein  and  supplement  to   cereal  based  diet.    It  contains  about  26%   protein,  which  is  almost  three  times  that  of  cereals  and   other  minerals  and  vitamins. Besides, it is also used as nutritive fodder, specially for milch animals.

Madhya  Pradesh,  and  Andhra  Pradesh  are major blackgram growing states area-wise. The  highest  yield  was  recorded  by  the  state  of  Bihar (898 kg/ha) followed by Sikkim (895 kg/ha) and Jharkhand (890 kg/ha). The National  yield  average is 585  kg/ha.  The  lowest  yield  was  recorded  in  the  state  of  Chattisgarh (309  kg/ha) followed by Odisha  (326 kg/ha) and J&K (385 kg/ha).

Climate

During  kharif,  it  is  cultivated  throughout  the  country.  It  is  best  suited  to  rice  fallows  during rabi in southern and south-eastern parts of India. Blackgram needs relatively heavier soils than greengram.

Soil

Black gram can be grown on variety of soils ranging from sandy soils to heavy cotton soils. The most ideal soil is a well  drained loam with  pH of  6.5 to 7.8. Black  gram cannot be  grown  on  alkaline  and  saline  soils. Land  is  prepared  like  any  other  kharif  season  pulse  crop. However during summer it requires a thorough preparation to give a pulverized free  from stubbles and weeds completely.

Varieties

The  powdery  mildew - resistant  variety  LBG  17  is  suitable  for  rabi  in  southern  zone,  and varieties PDU 1 and Mash 414 are suitable for spring season.

Use of resistant varieties is recommended as follows.


Yellow Mosaic Virus (YMV) resistant varieties : Pant U - 19, Pant U - 30 Sarala, Jawahar urd - 2, Teja   (LBG - 20), ADT - 4 
Powdery  Mildew  (PM) resistant varieties :  TAU - 2 , IPU  02 - 43
Stem fly resistant varieties : KBG - 512
Cercospora  leaf  spot resistant varieties : Jawa har urd - 2, Jawahar urd - 3 . 

Seed treatment

Rhizobium 200 gm + PSB 250 gm /10kg of seed.  Seed treatment with (Carbendazim 1 gm+ Thiram 1.5 gm) per kg of seed. Greengram blackgram  under intensive cropping should be treated with Carbofuran @ 0.2% one week before Rhizobium treatment against Root knot  and Reniform nematode.

Seed rate and Sowing

Optimum sowing time mid June subject to availability of moisture/rainfall. Seed rate is 15-20 kg/ha for kharif and 25-30 kg/ha for spring or rabi. Row-to-row distance is 30-35 cm for kharif and 25 cm for rabi or spring.

Fertilizer dose

20:40:20 NPK kg/ha along with 20 kg S/ha greatly increases yield of pulses and also benefit the succeeding crop. Among the micro nutrients Zn is the most deficient nutrient. So the application of Zn @ 25 kg/ha as basal gives very promising results.  Boron and Molybdenum gives better results in acid soil.

Foliar spray of 2% DAP and 2% KCl at Pre flowering stage enhances the yield.

Interculture

Control of weeds within 2 to 3 weeks not only prevents drawn of nutrients from the soil by weeds but also conserves moisture and helps in quick growth and development of crops. Line sowing will facilitate hoeing and weeding operation between the lines.

Weeding and hoeing is to be done between 25-30 days after sowing and if the weeds are still present in the field the 2nd weeding should be done at 45 days after sowing. Chemical herbicides like Pendimethalin or Metalachlor @ 1.0-1.5 kg/ha are found very effective as post emergence.

Irrigation

The pulse crops in Rabi and Pre rabi seasons are mostly grown on residual soil moisture condition. However irrigation should be provided at critical growth stage i.e flowering and pod development stage.

Plant protection

The  major  diseases  are  yellow  mosaic  in  northern  plains  and  powdery  mildew  in  southern  and  south-eastern  regions  (in  rabi).  To  control  insect  and  pest,  yellow mosaic virus, application of Phorate in soil before or at sowing @ 1 kg/ha is required.


Pod borer- spray Triazophos/ Monocrotophus @ 2 ml/ ltr of water, Carbaryl@ 2 kg/ha
Aphids- Spray methyl dementon 25 EC @ 1000 ml/ha
White fly -Spray the crop with Imidacloprid @ 1 ml/3.5 ltrs of water/Flonicamid-200gm/Ha

Harvesting, Threshing & Storage

Urd should be harvested when 70-80 % pods matured and most of the pods turn black. Over  maturity  may  result  in  shattering.  Harvested  crop  should  be  dried  on  threshing  floor  for  few days and then threshed. Threshing can be done either manually or by trampling under  the  feet  of  bullocks.  The  clean  seeds  should be  sun  dried  for  3 - 4  days  to  bring  their  moisture content at 8-10% to safely store in appropriate bins.

A well managed crop of  Urd may  produce  12 - 1 5 quintals grains/ha .

Recommendation to achieved higher production


Deep summer ploughing once in 3  years. 
Seed treatment should be done before sowing.
Application of fertilizer should be based on soil test value.
In kharif season sowing should be done by ridge &amp; furrow method. 
Yellow  mosaic  resistant/  tolerant  varieties  IPU  94 - 1  (Uttara),  shekhar 3(KU  309),  Ujala (OBJ 17), VBN (Bg) 7, Pratap  urd 1 etc choosen as per suitability to a region. 
Weed control should be done at right time.
Adopt integrated approach for plant protection.
