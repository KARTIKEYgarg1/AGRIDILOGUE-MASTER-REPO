Cowpea


Introduction

Botanical Name : Vigna sinensis Savi.

Common names : Cowpea, Lobia, Barbati, Black eyed pea

Family : Leguminaceae

Cowpea is  known  as  drought  hardy  nature,  its  wide  and  droopy leaves keeps soils and soil moisture conserved due  to  shading  effect.  It  is  also  known  as  black-eyed  pea  or  southern  pea  etc.  and  has  multiple  uses  like  food,  feed,  forage,  fodder,  green  manuring  and  vegetable.  Cowpea  seed  is  a  nutritious  component  in  the  human  diet,  and  cheap  livestock  feed  as  well.  Both  the  green  and  dried  seeds  are  suitable for canning and boiling as well

In  Indian  context,  it  is  a  minor  pulse  cultivated  mainly  in  arid  and  semi  arid  tracts  of  grown in pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and West UP along with considerable area in  Rajasthan, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamilnadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Climate

Cowpea is  warm  weather  and  semi  arid  crop,  where  temperature  ranging  from  200C  to  300C.  Minimum temperature for seed establishment is 200C and above 320C  temperatures development  of  root  is  cease.  For  maximum  production  day  temperature  270C  and  night  temperature  220C required. It is sensitive to cold and below 150 C temperature yield adversely affected. It can grow  under shade of tree but can not tolerate cold or frost.

Soil and its preparation

ell  drained  loam  or  slightly  heavy  soil  are best  suited.  In  colder  climate  somewhat  sandy  soil  preferred  as  crop  mature  earlier  in  them.  It  can  grow    successfully  in  acidic  soil  but  not  in  saline/alkaline  soil.  In  hard  soil,  one  deep  ploughing    followed  by  two  or  three  harrowing  and  planking  are  sufficient.  In  normal  soil  only  two    harrowing  &  planking  is  enough.  For  summer  season crop give a irrigation immediately after  harvesting of Rabi crop.

Sowing of Seed

 Time of Sowing 

The time of sowing varies according to type of crop.


Kharif crop: With  onset  of  monsoon  ranging  from  early  June  to  end  of  July.
Rabi - October - November (southern India)
Summer - 2nd to 4th week of March (grain), February (Fodder)
Hills - April - May
Green manuring - Mid June to 1st week of July 

Seed Rate 


For pure crop - 20 - 25 Kg.ha (grain)
For fodder and Green Manure - 30 - 35 kg./ha. 
During summer 30  kg/ha for grain and 4 - kg/ha for fodder and green manuring. 

Spacing

Row  to  row - 30 (Bushing)  to  45  cm  (spreading)

Plant  to  Plant - 10  (Bushing)  to  15                    cm (spreading)

 Method of Sowing 

Sowing  of  cowpea  is  done  by  broadcasting, line  sowing  and  dibbling  of  seeds  based  on  the  their  purpose and season. Line sowing has been better over broadcasting method of sowing. However, for  fodder and green manure crop broadcasting method considered better. In high rainfall area, formed  30 cm  wide and 15 cm deep drainage channel at every 2 meter interval  to drain excess rain water.  Sowing of seed a depth of 3 - 5 cm.

Seed treatment

Treat the seed with Thirum (2gm.) + Carbendazim (1gm.). It is also desirable to treat the seed with  Rhizobium culture @ 10g/kg seed.

Manuring

Apply FYM/compost - 5 - 10 t/ha  as  basal with last ploughing. 15 - 20  kg N/ ha  as starter dose  in poor  soils  (organic carbon<0.5%),  50 - 60  kg/ha  P2O5    and  50 - 60 kg.  K2O/ha .  Phosphorus  and  potassic  fertilizer should be give  according to soil  test value.

Micro  Nutrients


Zinc - Quantity  of  Zinc  requirement  determined  according  to  the  soil  type  &amp;  it’s availability  or  status  in  the  soil.  Therefore,  the  doses  of  zinc  should  be  applied  based  on  the soil type as follows.

Red  sandy  and  loamy  soils  - 2.5  kg  Zn / ha (12.5  kg  zinc  sulphate  hepta  hydrate/  7.5  kg  zinc  sulphate mono hydrate) per hectare. 
Black  soils  - 1.5  to  2.0  kg  Zn / ha (7.5  to  10  kg  zinc  sulphate  hepta  hydrate/  4.5  to  6.0  kg  zinc  sulphate mono hydrate) per hectare. 
Laterite, medium    and  alluvial  soils  - 2.5 kg Zn /ha (12.5 kg zinc sulphate hepta hydrate/ 7.5  kg zinc sulphate mono hydrate) as basal along with 200 kg of farm yard manure. 
Low organic carbon content and hilly sandy loam soil  &amp;  2.5 kg Zn / ha (12.5 kg zinc sulphate  hepta hydrate/ 7.5 kg zinc sulphate mono hydrate) as basal in every alternate year.

Molybdenum - In clay loam soils, apply 0.25 kg  Ammonium  Molybdate /ha as basal. 

Intercultural Operation

For  higher  yield  crop  should  be  free  from  weed  upto  25  to  30  day  crop  stage No weeding is given this crop. It covers the land very soon and kill the weeds by smoothing. Application  of  pendimethaline  @  0.75 - 1  kg.a.i./ha  combined with  one  hand  weeding  at  35  days  after  sowing  is  beneficial.

Irrigation

For  summer  crop,  irrigation  is  most  critical  among  all  inputs  followed  by  weeding  and  fertilizer.  Generally,  crop  required  5 - 6  irrigation  depending  on  soil,  prevailing  weather  conditions  etc,  at  an  interval  of  10-15  days.  The  response  to  irrigation  is  in  order  of  flowering>  pod  filling>vegetative.  Crop can tolerate flooding upto 2 days  at flowering and  pod setting thereafter, a marked  decrease in  yield and its attribute.

Plant protection

Diseases


Bacterial Blight 

Symptoms : The  germinating  seedling  turn  brown - red  and  die.  Irregular  to  round  spots  brown  in  colour  with  chlorotic  halos,  appear  on  leaves,  and  later  spread  to  stem. Stem may break, pods are also infected leading to shrivelled seeds. 
Control Measures : i) Grow  resistant  varieties;  ii)  Use  healthy and  disease free  seeds ;  iii)  In  case  of  severe  infection, crop may be sprayed with 0.2  %  (2g/liter) copper oxychloride (Blitox). 

Cowpea Mosaic 

Symptoms : It is caused by a virus transmitted by aphids. The affected leaves become pale  yellow  and  exhibit  mosaic,  vein banding  symptoms.  The  affected  leaves  become  reduced  in  size  and  show  puckering.  Pods  are  also  reduced  and  become twisted. 
Control Measures : i) Use healthy  seed  from  healthy  crop ;  ii)  For  controlling  aphids  spray  Oxydemeton  methyl  25  EC  (Metasystox)  @  1  ml/liter  or Imidacloprid  17.  8  SL @ 0. 2 ml/ liter of water and repeat the spray after 10 days  of first spray. 

Powdery mildew 

Symptoms : Powdery  mildew  are  visible  on  all  the  aerial  parts  of  the  affected  plants.  Symptoms first start from leaves and then spread to stem, branches and pods.  This  white  growth  consists  of  the  fungus  and  its  spores.  Affected  leaves  become twisted and smaller in size.
Control Measures :  i) After  harvest,  collect  the  plants  left  in  the  field  and  burn  them;  ii)  The  disease   can   be   controlled   by   spray   of   wettable   sulphur @   3g/liter   or  carbendazim @1 g/liter of water 


Pests


Cowpea pod borer

Nature of Damage : The  caterpillar  rolls  the  leaves  and  web  these  with  the  top  shoot.  Caterpillar  bore into the pods and feed on the seeds, if flower and pods are not available  larvae feed on foliage. 
Control Measures : i) Collect and  destroy the  eggs  and  young larvae;  ii) The young caterpillar can be killed  by dusting  2% methyl parathion @ 25 - 30 kg p er  hectare or spray of quinalphos @2 ml/liter of water;  iii) Fix 3  feet stick in the field @10/ha bird parches to attract predatory birds. 

Hairy caterpillar

 Nature of damage:  It is  major insect of cowpea. It is cut juvenile plants and eat away all the green  matter of the leaves. 
Control Measures : i) Collect and  burn  the  eggs  and  burn the  eggs  and  larva  of insect ; ii)  The  young  caterpillar  can  be  control by  spray of  Chloropyriphos or Quinolphos @ 2ml/liter of water.

 Aphids and Jassids 

Nature of Damage : The adult and nymphs of these pests suck the juice from the leaves and the  damage is more severe when the plants are young. As a result of sucking of  sap, the leaves turn brown and  crumbled and the plant look sick. 
Control Measures : i) Spray  of  Oxydemeton  Methyl  25  EC  (Metasystox) @  1  ml/  liter  or  Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.7 ml/ liter of water. 


Harvesting

Green pods for use as vegetable can be harvested 45 - 90  days after sowing depending on the variety.  For grains, the crop can be harvested in about 90-125 days after sowing when pods are fully matured.  The crop should be then dried and threshed , threshed grain should be dried in sun before storage. For fodder, the cutting of the crop depends upon the need and the stage of growth of the component  crop sown with it. Generally it should be done 40 - 45 days after sowing.

Yield

A good crop of cowpea yields about 12 - 15  q  of grain and 50 - 60  q of straw per  hectare. If the crop is  raised for fodder  purpose 250 - 350 q of green fodder is obtained per hectare.
