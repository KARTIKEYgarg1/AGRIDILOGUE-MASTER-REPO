French Beans


French bean   is  one  of  the  most  popular  and  widely  grown  vegetables  in  India.  The  green immature pods are cooked and eaten as  a   vegetable.  Immature   pods   are   marketed  fresh,  frozen or canned,  whole, cut or French  cut. It is also   an  important  pulse  crop,  with  high  yielding  ability  as  compared  to  gram  and  pea. It is  grown  in  Maharahstra,  , , Jammu and Kashmir and  NE  states.

Common names : Kidney bean, Common bean, Snap bean and French bean

Climate:

In the hilly region it is grown during kharif and in lower hills/tarai region, sown as spring crop. In  north-east plains and hilly tracts of Maharashtra, it is cultivated during rabi. It is  highly sensitive to  frost  and  water  logging.  The  ideal  temperature  range  for  proper  growth  of  this  crop  is  10 - 270 C.  Above  300 C,  the  flower  drop  is  a  serious  problem.  Similarly,  below  50 C  the  flowers  and  developing pods and branches are damaged.

Soil:

A  well drained loamy soil with pH range of 5.5-6.0 with cool climate is suited  for French bean cultivation. Although it can be grown on all types of soil, but loams and clay loams  are best for obtaining high  yield.

The  French  bean  varieties  are  classified  in  two  group’s viz.  Dwarf  or  bush  types  and  Climbing or pole types. The State- wise recommended varieties are as follows.

Plains - Arka Komal,  Premier, (Sel.9), Arka Suvidha, Arka Anoop, Arka Samrudhi, Arka Suman.


Land preparation

French bean having bold and hard seed coat needs  a  good seed bed accomplished by thorough primary tillage  like ploughing, harrowing or discing and planking. A good seed bed have friable but compact soil, adequate  moisture  and  free  from  weeds  and  plant  debris  of  earlier  crop is required.  Acidic  soils  of  the  hills  must be treated with lime before sowing. For preparation of field, soil is  ploughed 2 - 3 times with power tiller or with spade.  Planking is done during the last ploughing to make friable soil bed for sowing.

Seeds and sowing

Sowing time - Kharif (Hills) - last week June to first of July; Rabi (Plains) - 2nd fortnight of October   and for spring  (Lower hills)  - 2nd fortnight of March.

Seed Rate & Spacing :  100 - 125 kg/ha  Kharif (Hills)  - 45 - 50 cm x 8 - 10 cm;  Rabi & Spring  - 40 cm  x 10 cm (irrigated) ;  30 cm x 10 cm   (Rainfed).

Treat  the seeds with Trichoderma 4 g/kg or  Thiram or  Carbandazim @ 2 g/kg of seed 24 hours before sowing to control fungal   diseases. If the crop is raised for the first time it should be treated  with Rhizobium.

Nutrient management

The requirement of fertilizers depends upon the types and condition  of the soil. How ever the general recommendations are the following:


FYM : 20-50t/ha
N : P : K : : 90-120 : 60-80 : 50 

Apply full dose of P&K and half dose of N as basal dose. The remaining N at the time of flowering.              


After care:



French Bean germinates within 3-4 days. It starts flowering after 45 days. It should be weed free. Weeding  should be given 20 – 25 days and 40 – 45 days after sowing.  The crop should be earthed up after each  weeding. Pole type cultivars grow well on support made of cane frames. They  are also supported by erecting wooden poles connected with strings. 
 

Irrigation



It is shallow rooted and sensitive to both water excess and water stress  condition. Good crop can be obtained if a little moisture remains even in the rainy seasons. Deform pods can result from water stress due to low moisture or  excessive evaporation loss.              


Harvesting

For vegetable : Crop   will   be   normally ready   for  picking by 40 to 50 days after sowing  depending  on  the  variety  and  season  of cultivation. Harvest  during  cool  periods,  such  as  late afternoon or early morning. Immediately  after  harvesting  shift  the  harvested produce to shade. Further there  will be 2 to 3 pickings to  be done at 4 - 5 days interval.

For pulse : The crop matures in 125 - 130 days. Plants are cut with sickles after attaining full maturity judged by  severe  leaf  fall,  changing  colour  of  pods  and  hardness  of  the  grains.  Harvested  materials  after  3 - 4  days  sun  drying,  is  collected  in  bundles  to  the  threshing  floors.  Threshing  is  done  by  beating  with  sticks  or  trampling  under  the  feet  of  bullocks.    The  clean  seed  should  be  sun  dried  for  3 - 4  days  to  bring their moisture content at 9 - 10%.



Yield

Green pods : 8 - 10 t/ha in  90 to 110 days.

Pulse : A well managed crop can easily give 20 - 25qtls/ha yields under irrigated  conditions of plain and 5 - 10 q  /ha under rainfed conditions of hill with 40 - 50qtls/ha of straw for cattle’s.

Post harvest Management:

French beans are highly perishable and rapid cooling after harvesting is  important to maintain quality. After harvesting, beans are washed and culled and  diseased, inferior pods are destroyed. Before these are placed in storage or transit  the beans should be cooled as rapidly as possible. Optimum storage and transit  temperature are 5-7 0C. Under these conditions storage life are increases up to 20- 25days. At temperature below 1-2.50C, chilling injury occurs 10-12 days after  storage.



Insect pest:

Pod borer : Light brown and tiny greenish caterpillers make holes in the pods and  feeds on the seeds within.

Leaf eating caterpillar : Green caterpillar feed on leaves and tender plant parts

Aphids : Small soft bodies insect suck sap from the leaves, tendershoot & flower  buds which curl, deform and dry up.

Disease

Anthracnose : Black sunken spots with reddish or yellow margins on all portion above  ground lesions on hypocotyls cause death. Seeds inside the pod also infested.

Rust : The yellow spots in cluster are earlier symptoms. Later no they convert  in  dark brown to black longitudinal lesions. In severe case entire plants may be  killed

Leaf spot : Small circular or irregular spot

Common bean mosaic : Severe mosaic molting with slight puckering and swelling of leaves and  stipules, plants stunted and produce fewer pods.

Crop stage-wise Integrated Pest Management

Pre-sowing 


Deep  ploughing  of  fields  during  summer  to  control  nematode  population,  to  expose   pupae; propagules of soil borne pathogens and to reduce the weeds infestation.
Soil solarization 
Timely sowing should be done. 
Field sanitation. 
Destroy the alternate host plants 
Growing pea or marigold as a trap crop for the management of leaf miner.
Plant tall border crops like mustard for the management of aphids. 
Crop rotation with non leguminous crops especially cereals. 
Adopt  ecological  engineering  by  growing  the  recommended  attractant,  repellent,  and   trap crops around the field bunds. 

Sowing 


 Select healthy and disease free seeds.
The seeds should be thoroughly rinsed and dried in shade. 
Mulching with straw/pine needles/ Eucalyptus  leaves. 
Avoid dense sowing. 
Sowing in well drained soil. 
Follow optimum sowing depth of 5-7 cm. 
Intercropping with mustard where nematodes are the problem. 

Vegetative stage

Common cultural practices: 


 Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop 
Avoid water stagnation conditions. 

Common mechanical practices: 


Collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae 
Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant parts
Use yellow sticky traps for aphids and leaf miner @ 4-5 traps/acre. 
Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm
Erecting  of  bird  perches  @  20/acre  for  encouraging  predatory  birds  such  as  King  crow,   common mynah etc.
Set up bonfire during evening hours between 7-8 pm 

Common biological practices: 


Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies. 
Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval parasitoids are observed
