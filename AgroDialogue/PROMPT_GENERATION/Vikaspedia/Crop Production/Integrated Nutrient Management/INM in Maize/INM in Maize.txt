INM in Maize


Among all the cereals maize (Zea mays L.)  ranks third after wheat and rice in production and it is consumed as a staple food in several countries of tropics and subtropics. Corn is used as a staple food for humans and as a quality fodder. It serves as a basic raw ingredient for industrial products like starch, food sweeteners, oil, pharmaceutical, protein, alcoholic beverages, cosmetic, gum, textile, film package, paper industries etc.

Maize is considered as “queen of cereals”. It being a C4 plant can effectively utilize CO2 even at high intensity.   Maize  is  an  exhaustive  crop  and needs  balanced  supply of macro and micro-nutrients.

What is INM

Integrated  Nutrient Management (INM) is the process to maintain the soil fertility and  plant nutrient supply at an optimum level through optimization by the  benefits of all possible sources of nutrients like inorganic, organic,  biofertilizers and through green manure.

Benefits:


 Maintains the balance between crop requirement and the nutrients from native and applied sources. 
 Enhances soil integrity and the physico-chemical nature by addition of ecofriendly fertilizers.
 Reduces the carbon foot print and emission of greenhouse gases. 
 Improves the productivity by enhancing the availability of applied as well as native nutrients.

Components:


Inorganic fertilizers (Simple, Complex fertilizers etc.)
Organic fertilizers (FYM, Vermicomost)
Biofertilizers (VAM, AM, AZOTOBACTER)
Green manure (Red gram, Dolichos bean)

INM in Maize

Recommended nutrients

Maize is a very exhaustive crop and demands relatively high amount of fertilizers. It responds well to applied nutrients either  through  organic  or  inorganic  sources.

The  rate  of  nutrient application  depends  mainly  on  soil  nutrient  status /balance  and cropping  system.  For obtaining desirable  yields,  the  doses of applied  nutrients should be matched  with  the soil supplying capacity and plant demand  (Site-specific  nutrient   management  approach) by  keeping  in  view the  preceding  crop  (cropping  system).

For  higher  economic  yield  of  maize,  application  of  10  t  FYM per ha, 10-15 days prior to sowing supplemented with 150-180 kg N,  70-80 kg P2O5, 70-80  kg K2O and 25 kg ZnSO4 per ha is recommended.

Seed treatment with 600 g of Azospirillum help in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in the soil and provide nourishment to the growing plants.

Neem  oil coated urea (NOCU) in 700 ppm concentration is recommended for higher  yield, returns and nitrogen use efficiency in Kharif maize. Application  of slow release neem/sulphur coated urea and the residue in the maize  wheat/mustard-mungbean cropping systems recommended for enhancing crop  health, soil properties and productivity.

Full doses of P, K and Zn should be applied as  basal  preferably  drilling  of  fertilizers  in  bands  along  the  seed  using  seed-cum-fertilizer  drills.  Nitrogen  should  be  applied  as follows in  5 splits for  higher  productivity  and  use  efficiency.

Cultural practices for better nutrient uptake


Raised  bed  (ridge)  planting   facilitates  in  placement  of  seed  and  fertilizers  at  proper  place  in  one  operation  that  helps  in  getting  good  crop  stand,  higher productivity and resource use efficiency.
Weeds  are  the  serious  problem  in  maize,  particularly  during kharif / monsoon  season  they  competes with  maize  for  nutrient  and  causes  yield  loss  up  to  35  %.    Therefore,  timely  weed  management is needed for achieving higher yield.
To enhance the profitability of maize based cropping systems planting of three rows of black gram between paired rows of maize proved beneficial over sole maize.

Nutrient deficiency

Nutrient  deficiencies  in  crops  reduce  yields,  quality  and  profits  to  the  farmer.  Yield  can  often  be  reduced  10 - 30%  by  deficiencies  of  major  nutrients  before  any  clear  symptoms  of  deficiency are observed in the field.
