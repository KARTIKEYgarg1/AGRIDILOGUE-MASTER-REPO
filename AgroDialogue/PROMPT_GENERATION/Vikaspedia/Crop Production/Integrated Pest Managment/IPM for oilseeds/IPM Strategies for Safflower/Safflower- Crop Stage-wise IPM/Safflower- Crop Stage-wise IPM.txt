Safflower: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Deep summer ploughing to control juveniles and adults of nematodes, and   resting stages of insect pests. • Follow crop rotation with non-host crops • Destroy the alternate host plants • Sow the ecological engineering plants • Sow sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around the main crop as a   guard/barrier crop


Nutrients
• Nutrients should be applied   based on the soil test report and recommendations for the particular agro-climatic zone. • In preceding kharif season, grow soybean/ mungbean/ cowpea etc. pulse   crops. • Generally, safflower crop remove 25 – 30 Kg N, 12-15 Kg P2O5, 15-20 Kg   K2O and 10- 15 Kg S per acre. • Add well decomposed FYM @ 4 t/ acre or vermicompost @ 2 t/ acre treated   with Trichoderma spp. and VAM. • Incorporate treated FYM at the time of field preparation at 2 to 3 weeks   before sowing and vermicompost at 1 week before sowing. • Application of sulphur @ 6-18 Kg/acre significantly increases yield


Weeds
• Summer deep ploughing • In kharif fallow fields, check the weed growth by harrowing during   monsoon rains. • At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to   minimize the weeds menace in the field



Seed sowing*



Nutrients
Common cultural practices: • Use resistant/tolerant varieties • Use healthy, certified, weed seed free seeds • Timely sowing should be done. • Nitrogen is applied in two splits - ½ as basal and ½ at flowering. • At the time of sowing, apply 15-20 Kg N and 12-15 Kg P2O5, 12-15 Kg K2O   and 10-15 Kg S/ acre. • Under rainfed conditions, entire fertilizers are applied by drilling at   sowing. • Under irrigated conditions, ½ N and whole P, K &amp; S fertilizers are   applied at sowing. • Based on soil test for micronutrient, the deficient micronutrient should   be applied in soil at sowing. • Biofertilizers: Seed/seedling treatment with Azotobacter and   phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (PSB) cultures @ 250 g each /acre seed.


Weeds
• Adopt the recommended   agronomic practices such as timely sowing, line sowing, proper spacing, gap filling etc. • Intercropping with chick pea/wheat/linseed/coriander may be adopted   for better utilization of inter row space and suppressing the weeds as per   regional recommended agronomic practices.



Vegetative stage




Common cultural practices: • Field sanitation and rogueing • Judicious use of fertilizers • Collect and destroy crop debris • Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • Avoid water logging • Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval   parasitoids are observed Common mechanical practices: • Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant   parts • Collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae • Handpick the older larvae during early stages of the crop • Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on   stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water • Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • Erect bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as King   crow, common mynah etc. • Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies • Apply second dose (top dressing) of N i.e. 15-20 Kg N/ acre at 35 days   after sowing • Micronutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of   particular micronutrient i.e. foliar application of zinc 3 ppm + copper 1 ppm + boron   0.5 ppm


Weeds
• Use the black plastic mulch to   suppress the weeds germination and growth between the rows. • Practice one or two had tool weeding/hoeing at 25 to 30 and 45 to 50 days   after sowing depending on the length of rosette period and the severity of   weed infestation.


Gram pod borer/capsule borer
Cultural control: • Growing intercrops such as cowpea, onion, maize, coriander, urd bean   etc. • Rotate the safflower crop with a non-host cereal crop such as wheat or   barley, cucurbit, or cruciferous vegetable • Grow repellant plants: Ocimum/Basil • Plant ovipositional trap crops such as marigold for Helicoverpa • Intercropping with non-host crop like wheat or barley • Avoid chickpea as intercrop Biological control: • Inundatively release Trichogramma pretiosum @ 40,000/acre 4-5 times from   flower initiation stage at weekly intervals • Application of NPV @ 100 LE/acre in combination with jaggery 1 Kg,   sandovit 100 ml or Robin Blue 50 g thrice at 10-15 days interval on observing the eggs   or first instar larvae in the evening hours • Apply entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) @ 100 crore infective juveniles   of Steinernema feltiae/acre


Safflower caterpillar
Cultural control: • Intercropping with non-host crop such as wheat • Follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices


Safflower bud fly
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices


Safflower aphid
Cultural control: • If the attack is observed in the border rows take control measures • Intercultural operations such as harrowing and hoeing reduce weeds such   as Parthenium hysterophorus in safflower field which serve as alternate hosts   for safflower aphids • Intercropping with sorghum, wheat and coriander reduces aphid   infestation • Intercropping with niger should be avoided Biological control: • Release of Chrysoperla larva @ 2-3/plant or 70,000/acre • Spray neem oil emulsion @ 0.25% • Spray NSKE 4% Chemical control: • Spray acephate 75% SP @ 312 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or dimethoate   30% EC @ 264 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or phenthoate 2% DP @ 8,000 g/acre   or quinalphos 1.5% DP @ 8,000 g/acre


Alternaria leaf blight
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Avoid growing in low-lying and flooding areas • Do not delay irrigation until the crop exhibits moisture stress symptoms


Cercospora leaf spot
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Avoid growing in low-lying and flooding areas • Avoid continuous cropping/follow crop rotation


Powdery mildew
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Do not plant spineless genotypes (more susceptible)


Rust
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Avoid growing in low-lying areas and flooding under irrigation • Do not delay irrigation until the crop exhibits moisture stress symptoms


Ramularia   leaf spot, root rot and wilt
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Same as rust disease



Reproductive stage



Nutrients
• Under rainfed conditions,   spray cycocel @ 500 ppm using 200 l per acre water at flower initiation to get higher seed yields


Weeds
• Left over weeds should be   removed from the field by manual weeding before they flowering or shedding their seeds to avoid further spread of weed seeds


Insects and diseases
• Same as in vegetative   stage • Follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices


Head rot and wilt
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Don’t pileup the soil around the stem during rains • Follow crop rotation in heavily infested soils


Bird damage
Cultural control: • Cultivate safflower in large contiguous blocks • Safeguard the crop through bird scaring objects


Note: The pesticide dosages and spray fluid   volumes are based on high volume sprayer. *Apply Trichoderma viride/harzianum and   Pseudomonas fluorescens as seed/seedlings/planting material, nursery   treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for   label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption   in their fields, registration is not required).
