Castor: Insect Pests Management


Red headed hairy caterpillar

Biology:

Egg: The female moth lays its eggs in clusters on the under-sides of leaves and covers them with pale brown hairs. The incubation period lasts from 5 to 10 days.
Larva: The newly hatched larvae feed gregariously and after a few days feed on the leaves independently. Larva has red head, body covered with long dense, reddish brown hairs. Both anterior and posterior ends have black broad bands (hairs) with a reddish area in the middle.
Pupa: The pupa resembles is mostly darker in color, although it sometimes is yellowish in color. The pupa bears spiny hairs on the posterior end. Pupa undergoes diapause during winter. The larval period varies from 15 to 85 days and the pupal period 7 to 20 days.
Adult: The pest is active throughout the year and has several generations. Adult moths have dirty white forewings and milky white hind wings with black spots. Forewings have a reddish brown band along coaster margin. The peak period of activity is August-September

Damage symptoms:

Scrap under surface of leaves when they are in neonate stage. The scrapped patches of the leaves becomes thin and papery
Full grown larvae devours entire foliage and flowers causing defoliation and affecting fruit setting and often migrate from one field to another devastating whatever crops come their way.
After about 30-40 days of feeding the larvae burrow into soil, usually in the undisturbed soil of field or non-cropped areas and pupate.

Natural enemies of red headed hairy caterpillar:

Parasitoids: Trichogramma spp., Enicospilus sp
Predators: Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi, ladybird beetle, reduviid bug, spider, red ant, robber fl y, black drongo (King crow), common mynah, big-eyed bug (Geocoris sp), earwig, ground beetle, pentatomid bug (Eocanthecona furcellata), preying mantis etc.

Castor semilooper

This is a serious pest of the oilseed crop and is distributed throughout the Indian Union, wherever castor is grown. It occurs during July to September

Biology:

Egg: The female moth lays around 450 blue green rounded eggs singly on the leaves of the castor plant at night. The eggs are laid singly on both sides of the leaves. Four to six eggs have been observed on each leaf. The egg when freshly laid is round, pale green in colour and measures about 0.9 mm in diameter. The chorion is full of ridges and furrows. The egg is convex on the upper surface and concave below. The incubation period of the egg varies from 2 to 5 days from July to September.
Larva: The newly hatched caterpillar is yellowish green in colour with light brown head and thorax and measures 3.5 mm long. The full grown larva is dull greyish brown and measures 60 to 70 mm long. Five distinct larval instars are present. The larval period lasts from 12 to 13 days in July, August and September.
Pupa: Pupation takes place either in the soil amidst the fallen leaves or sometimes amidst the folded leaves on the plant. The pupal period lasts from 10 to 27 days.
Adult: Adults are grayish-brown in colour. Forewings have pale reddish brown patch. Black hind wings have white stripes in the middle and 3 large white spots on outer margin.

A generation is completed in about 28 to 45 days

Damage symptoms:

Freshly hatched larvae feed gregariously, scraping the chlorophyll, soon disperse.
Sometimes the feeding is so heavy that only petioles and branches are left behind.
Caterpillars feed on the leaves and cause sometimes complete devastation of the crop.
Damage to defoliation.

Biology:
It is found throughout the tropical and subtropical parts of the world, wide spread in India. Besides tobacco, it feeds on cotton, castor, groundnut, tomato, cabbage and various other cruciferous crops.


Egg: Female lays about 300 eggs in clusters. The eggs are covered over by brown hairs and they hatch in about 3-5 days.
Larva: Caterpillar measures 35-40 mm in length, when full grown. It is velvety, black with yellowish – green dorsal stripes and lateral white bands with incomplete ring – like dark band on anterior and posterior end of the body. It passes through 6 instars. Larval stage lasts 15-30 days
Pupa: Pupation takes place inside the soil. Pupal stage lasts 7-15 days.
Adult: Moth is medium sized and stout bodied with forewings pale grey to dark brown in colour having wavy white crisscross markings. Hind wings are whitish with brown patches along the margin of wing. Pest breeds throughout the year. Moths are active at night. Adults live for 7-10 days. Total life cycle takes 32-60 days. There are eight generations in a year.

Damage symptoms:

The early instar larvae feed gregariously on the under surface of the leaf by scrapping off the chlorophyll leading to appearance of papery membranes
Later they disperse, become solitary and nocturnal and cause complete defoliation
They also feed on the flower buds, flowers.

Biology:

Egg: The female moths lay eggs on the tender parts of the plant.
Larva: Pale greenish with pinkish tinge and fi ne hairs with dark head and prothoracic shield. The caterpillar that hatches out bores into the shoot if the plant is young and knit the seed capsules if the plant is old. The full-grown caterpillar is stout, reddish brown in colour and measures 15 to 25 mm. long. It pupates in a silken cocoon.

Sometimes the damage caused by this pest to castor crop is serious. More serious in summer months (March to May) Temperature of 30 °C with high relative humidity favours multiplication of the pest

Biology:

Egg: The female lays shining white long eggs in small clusters or scattered about on the underside of tender leaves.
Nymph: The eggs hatch into nymphs which settle on the leaves and along with the adults suck the sap from the leaves. Both the nymphs and the pupa are yellowish in colour.
