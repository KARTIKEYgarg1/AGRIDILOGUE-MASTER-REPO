Sunflower-Crop Stage Wise IPM





ManagementActivity



Pre-sowing





Common cultural practices:

Deep ploughing during summer exposes the pests and weeds to high temperature and reduces their load present in the soil.
Crop rotation of 3-4 years reduces soil borne diseases 
Adopt timely sowing should be done.
Keeping field bunds and crop free of weeds to avoid high pest load as it favours the pest build up on the main crop.







Nutrients





Incorporate 3-4 t/acre of well decomposed FYM or compost or crop residues treated with Trichoderma 2-3 week prior to sowing.
Do not leave FYM or compost exposed to sunlight as nutrients may be lost.
Apply adequate and balanced nutrients along with organics as per soil test basis.




Weeds


At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique i.e. pre sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in field. Adopt integrated weed management to reduce weed competition.




Soil borne diseases (Downy mildew, Charcoal rot, Sclerotium wilt, Alternaria leaf spot, Rust) and Sunflower necrosis virus

Cultural control:

Uproot and burn infected plants early enough to avoid spread of the disease.
Effective weed control.
Maintain good fertility levels.
Place the seeds at a depth of 3 cm along the furrows in which the fertilizer mixture is placed and cover with soil. Put two seeds per hole at the rate of 1.6-2.8Kg/acre based on irrigated and rainfed land.




Thrips

Cultural control:

Destroying queen by digging it out from the termitorium in red soil areas.
Field sanitation and use of fully decomposed FYM mixed with wood ash will reduce termite activity





Sowing/Seedling




Common cultural practices:




Application of balanced dose of NPK fertilizers
Use healthy, clean, quality, certified and weed free seeds.
Timely sowing with recommended spacing
Use tolerant/resistant varieties
Sow trap crops like marigold at@50 plants/acre







Common mechanical practices:

Collection and destruction of plant debris
Use of pheromone traps @4-5 traps/acre
Set up of light traps @1trap/acre
Set up yellow sticky traps @4-5traps/acre coated with grease/sticky oily materials.
Collect and destroy egg masses, larvae and damaged leaves in early stage




Nutrient management


For efficient use of applied fertilizers, adopt fertilizer cum seed drill.
Seed treatment should be done with Azotobactor /Azospirillum and PSB @ 250 g /acre and VAM inoculum @ 1Kg /acre as soil application.
Fertilizers should be applied on soil test basis. Generally, it is recommended to apply NPK @ 25, 20 and 16 Kg /acre.  Apply 50% of N and full dose of P &amp;K preferably in the form of band placement at the time of sowing.
Apply Sulphur @10-15 Kg/ acre through gypsum or Single Super Phosphate (SSP).
Prefer SSP as source of Phosphorous as it also supply Sulphur to the crop.
In boron deficient soils, apply boron @ 400 g / acre (4.5 Kg borax per acre) in alternate years.
In saline soils, sow sunflower on ridges and apply additional N @ 8 Kg/ acre.
Spray boron @0.2% as directed spray to capitulum at ray floret  28 opening stage.
