Wheat: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Deep ploughing of fields during summer to control nematodes population,   to expose pupae and popagules of soil borne pathogens. • Soil solarization • Timely sowing should be done. • Field sanitation, rogueing. • Destroy the alternate host plants • Growing pea or marigold as a trap crop for the management of Leaf   miner. • Plant tall border crops like mustard for the management of aphids. • Crop rotation with non-cereals. • Adopt ecological engineering by growing the attractant, repellent, and   trap crops around the field bunds.


Nutrients
• At the time of field   preparation, apply FYM @ 4.0 t/ acre 2-3 week before sowing or vermicompost @   2.0 t/acre at one week before sowing. • Grow suitable green manure crop to improve soil health.


Weeds
Cultural control: • At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to   minimize the weeds menace in field. • Zero till practice is also minimize the weed seed germination.


Soil   and seed borne pathogens, Nematodes, Termites, Resting stage of insects
Cultural control: • Apply well rotten farm yard manure only to discourage termite   infestation. • Avoid late sowing of crops. • For nematode: Non host crops of gram mustard cumin carrots, onion are   suggested for 3 years. • For others follow common cultural practices. Chemical control: For nematode: • Carbofuran 3% CG @ 26640 g/acre , For Termite: • Thiamethoxam 30% FS @ 1.32 Kg per 40 Kg seeds or Chlorpyrifos 20% EC @ 3   – 4 ml/Kg seed and 0.8-1.2 l/acre as soil application



Sowing/Seedling*



Wheat is a Rabi crop that is grown in the winter season. Sowing   of wheat takes place in October to December and harvesting is done during the   months of February and May. The wheat crop needs cool winters and hot   summers, which is why the fertile plains of the Indo-Gangetic region are the   most conducive for growing it. Though well-drained loams and clayey loams are   considered the ideal soil for wheat, good crops of wheat have also been   raised on sandy loams and black soils of the peninsula region. India is   broadly divided into 5 wheat zones based on agro-climatic conditions


1.   The North-Western Plains Zone: This is the most important zone and comprises   the plains of the States of Punjab, Haryana, Jammu, Rajasthan and western   Uttar Pradesh. The wheat here is planted in late October - November and the   harvesting usually begins by middle of April.


2.   The North Eastern Plains Zone: This zone consists of eastern Uttar Pradesh,   Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Manipur, Tripura, Meghalaya, Nagaland,   Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. Since rice is harvested later in this   area, wheat can be sown only in late November or early December. Harvesting   is done by March - April.


3. The Central Zone: This zone consists of Madhya Pradesh,   Gujarat, southeastern Rajasthan and the Bundelkhand area of Uttar Pradesh.   Almost 75 per cent of the wheat cultivated here depends on rain for   irrigation. The best quality Durum wheat is produced in this zone.


4.   The Peninsular Zone: The peninsular zone consists of the southern States of   Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. Sowing is usually   completed by early November and harvesting begins in the second half of   February. Wheat is produced the earliest in this zone.


5.   The Northern Hill Zone: This zone includes the hilly areas of Kashmir,   Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Sikkim. Wheat is sown   in October and harvested in May-June. The crop remains dormant in the cold   months of November to March and starts growing as the temperature rises in   April.


For   good and uniform germination, the wheat crop requires a well pulverised but   compact seedbed. The wheat seeds should be healthy and have a good   germination capacity. Make sure the seeds for sowing don't contain any seeds   of weeds. Experts suggest the use of certified seeds obtained from a reliable   seed agency. Seeds need to be planted on time to conserve moisture for a good   crop.


Nutrients
• Seed treatment should be done   with Azotobactor culture @ 200 g/acre. • Fertilizers should be applied on soil test basis. Generally, 60 Kg N, 25   Kg P2O5 and 20 Kg K2O per acre is recommended for wheat. • Apply 1/3 of N and full dose of P &amp; K at the time of sowing.


Weeds
• Hand weeding


Soil   and seed borne pathogens, Nematodes, Resting stage of insects
Cultural control: • For Loose smut: The seed is soaked in cold water during hot summer months   in the morning hours and kept in hot sun from 8 am -12 noons and then dried   in the afternoon. This kills the fungus inside the seed and provides a good disease   measure without use of fungicides. However, precautions to be taken so that   there is no damage to the viability of seeds. • Use resistant/tolarent varieties. • For seed gal nematode use certified seed resistance varieties only clean seed   by sieving or by using 2% salt water floatation to remove galls and prevent   ear cockle diseases. • Use the tolerant varieties such as C-306 for brown mite. • Dry cleaning: Galls can be separated by coarse sieve from the healthy   seeds. • Winnowing or fanning • Brine floatation: 2% salt solution in place of plain water removes almost   100 % galls. Biological Control: • Pseudomonas fluorescens 1.75% WP (In house isolated Strain Accession No.   MTCC 5176) @ 5 g/Kg seed (seed treatment) • Pseudomonas fluorescens 1.75% WP (In house isolated Strain Accession No.   MTCC 5176)@ 5 g/l (Foliar spray) • Apply neem cake@ 80 Kg/acre.
