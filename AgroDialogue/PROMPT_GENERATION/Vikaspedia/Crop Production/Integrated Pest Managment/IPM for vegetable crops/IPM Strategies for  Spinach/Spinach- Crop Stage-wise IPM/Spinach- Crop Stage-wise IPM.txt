Spinach: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Deep summer ploughing • Timely sowing should be done. • Field sanitation, rogueing • Sow the ecological engineering plants • Sow/plant sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around spinach field as guard   crop • Destroy the alternate host plants • Follow crop rotation with non-host spinach crop • Grow trap crops such as castor for S. litura, marigold for H. armigera.   and tomato for leaf miner


Nutrients
• Apply manures and fertilizers   as per soil test recommendations and agroclimatic zone • Apply FYM @ 10 t/ acre and incorporate in the soil 2 to 3 weeks before   sowing.


Weeds
• At the time of field   preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to minimize the weeds menace in   field or • Soil solarization with transparent polyethylene sheet may be adopted


Soil   borne pathogens, nematodes, resting stages of insects and weeds
Cultural control: • Excessive watering and poorly drained areas of field should be avoided   and use raised beds: more than 35 cm height is better for water drainage for   the management of damping off. Biological control: • Apply neem cake/pongamia cake @ 100 Kg/acre or press mud @ 2 t /acre



Sowing *




Common cultural practices: • Use resistant/tolerant varieties • Select healthy, certified, and weed seed free seeds


Nutrients
• Apply 8 Kg Nitrogen, 16 Kg   Phosphorus and 8 Kg Potash/acre as basal dose.


Weeds
• Adopt recommended agronomic   practices with respect to timely sowing, seed rate, row spacing, fertilizer   application, irrigation management etc. to have healthy crop.


Soil borne disease
Cultural control: • Seeds are soaked in water overnight before sowing • Line spacing is at 20 cm and thinning within lines at 10-12 cm. • Irrigation at 4-5 days interval in summer and 8-10 days interval in   winter.


Leaf   miner and other insect pests
Cultural control: • Avoid excess use of nitrogen. • Inter-planting with beans to reduce attack. Biological control: • Spray NSKE 4%.


*Apply Trichoderma viride/harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens   as seed treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides   produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).



Vegetative stage




Common cultural practices: • Collect and destroy crop debris • Judicious use of fertilizers • Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • Avoid water logging • Avoid any stress to the crop as much as possible • Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval   parasitoids are observed Common mechanical practices: • Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant   parts • Collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae • Handpick the older larvae during early stages of crop • Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on   stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. • Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such   as king crow, common mynah etc. • Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies


Nutrients
• Apply 12 Kg N/acre as top   dressing at 30 days after sowing. • In case of slow growth of the crop top dressing of the N may be done   after each cutting. • Micronutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of   particular micronutrient.


Weeds
• Hand tool weeding/hoeing   should be done to keep the field weeds free up to 30 days crop stage.


Leaf miner
• See common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices. Biological control: • Spray neem oil @ 5 ml/l of water + 0.5 ml/l sticker


Spinach crown mite
• See common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices.


Caterpillars,   beet army worm
• See common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices. Biological control: • Release egg parasitoids viz., Trichogramma chilonis and T. pretiosum @   25,000/acre • Spraying NSKE 4% against eggs and first instar larva.


Cutworm
• See common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices. Biological control: • Release of Trichogramma spp. @ 20,000/acre.


Amaranthus weevil
• See common cultural practices.


Aphid
Cultural control: • Reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from   feeding on plants. • For others see common cultural practices. Mechanical control: • If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the   infestation can be pruned out. Biological control: • Release 1st instar larvae of green lacewing bug (Chrysoperla zastrowi   sillemi) @ 4,000/acre. • Spraying with tobacco decoction (1 Kg tobacco boiled in 10 l of water for   30 minutes and making up to 30 l + 100 g soap).


Downy mildew
Cultural control: • See common cultural, mechanical and biological practices.


Anthracnose
Cultural control: • Harvesting and cutting of leaves at regular intervals to reduce spread of   diseases. • Reduce leaf moisture by avoiding sprinkler irrigation. • See common cultural, mechanical and biological practices.


Cladosporium   and Stemphylium leaf spot
Cultural control: • After harvest of spinach seed crops, incorporate residues into the soil   to prevent the sexual/asexual stage of the fungus from forming fruiting   bodies on residues that remain on the soil surface. • Plough (disk) volunteer plants and residue to reduce the disease   inoculum. • See common cultural, mechanical and biological practices.


Damping off &amp; root rot
• See common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices.



Reproductive stage   (for seed production purpose only)



Nutrients
• Micronutrient deficiency   should be corrected by foliar spray of particular micronutrient.


Weeds
• Left over weeds should be   removed from the field before shedding of seeds to avoid further spread of   weed seeds.


Pests and diseases
• Same as in vegetative stage.
