Crop stage-wise IPM for Curry Leaf





Management 
Activity




Pre-sowing




Nutrients



The field is ploughed 3-4 times to get a fine   tilth. Before last ploughing well decomposed farm yard manure (FYM) is   applied @ 8 t/acre. 
Pit size of 30 x30x30 cm is dug one to two   months before planting at a spacing of 1.2 x 1.5 m (in case of sole crop) or   1.5 x 3 m or 1.5 x 2m 
Apply 26: 9: 8 kg N: P: K/acre acre at the   time of planting





Weeds



Remove or incorporate previous crop residues before   planting.
Plan to grow suitable intercrops like legumes,   ginger, tapioca etc.





Resting stages of pests, soil-borne fungus



Deep summer ploughing 
Soil solarization: Cover the beds with   polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing   for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil-borne pests.





* Applying Trichoderma as seed and nursery treatment and Pseudomonas   fluorescens as seed, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial   products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by   farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).




Vegetative stage




Nutrients



Apply 4 kg of FYM, 5: 10: 10 g N: P: K/plant   and mix with soil after every harvest.





Weeds &amp; Inter cultivation



Periodical hoeing/ hand weeding from pits   should be done after every irrigation. 
In the first year intercropping with pulses   can be grown. 
After attaining 1 m height, the terminal bud   is cut off to encourage basal branching. In total 5-6 branches are maintained   per bush.





Leaf spot


Cultural control:

Disease-free seed and seedlings should always   be used 

Biological control: 

Preventive spray of tobacco decoction could be   sprayed (dose). 
Citrus oil at 1360 ppm inhibited the maximum   growth of the fungus followed by lemongrass oil at 1720 ppm and peppermint at   2260 ppm, respectively
Spray NSKE 5%





Tortoise beetle


Mechanical control:

Hand picking of larva 

Biological control: 

Conserve parasitoids such as Trichogramma   evanescens (egg), Telenomus sp (egg), Distatrix papilionis (larval),   Brachymeria sp (larval), Pteromalus sp (pupal), 
Spray NSKE 5% or neem oil @ 1-2 %





Leaf eating caterpillar (Citrus butterfly)


Cultural control: 

Yellow sticky traps @4-5 /acre for monitoring

 Biological control: 

Conserve predators such as predatory wasps,   lady beetles, lacewing, syrphid fly larvae. 
Horticultural mineral oils @ 0.5 -1% 
Dusting of cow dung ash. 
Spray NSKE 5% or 0.03 % Azadirachtin 
Application of fish oil rosin soap at one part   in 25 parts of water is highly effective against this sucking pest.





Citrus psylla or psyllid


Cultural control: 

Close monitoring and pruning of the infested   plant parts

 Biological control: 

Conserve natural predators such as predatory   wasps, lacewings, ladybugs (Chilocoris nigritus), predatory ants, predatory   mites etc. 
Horticultural mineral oils @ 0.5-1%





Scale insects


Biological control: 

Predatory wasps, syrphid/hover flies, ladybugs   or mealybug destroyers (a conccinellid, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri) etc.





Mealybug


Biological control:

Predatory midges, green lacewings, lady bird   beetles, hover flies, wasps etc.





Citrus leafminer


Biological control:

Conserve parasitoids such as Closterocerus spp., Cirrospilius spp., Pnigalio spp., Chrysocharis spp., and Sympieses spp. 
Spray NSKE 5%





Aphid


Biological control:

Conserve parasitoids such as Aphidius   colemani, Diaeretiella spp. Aphelinus spp. etc. 
Conserve predators such as anthocorid   bugs/pirate bugs (Orius spp.), mirid bugs, syrphid/hover flies, green   lacewings (Mallada basalis and Chrysoperla carnea), predatory coccinellids   (Stethorus punctillum), staphylinid beetle (Oligota spp.), predatory   cecidomyiid fly (Aphidoletis aphidimyza) and predatory gall midge, (Feltiella   minuta), earwigs, ground beetles, rove beetles, spiders, wasps etc.





Reproductive stage (in subsequent seasons)




Nutrient management


Apply 4 kg of FYM, 5: 10:10 g N: P: K/plant and mix with soil after   every harvest.




Weed management


Need based hoeing and weeding should be done around the plant to keep   it weed free.
