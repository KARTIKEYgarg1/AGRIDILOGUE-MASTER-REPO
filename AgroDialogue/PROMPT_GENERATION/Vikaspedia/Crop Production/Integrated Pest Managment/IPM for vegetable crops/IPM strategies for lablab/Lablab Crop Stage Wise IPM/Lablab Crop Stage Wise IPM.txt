Lablab Crop Stage Wise IPM





 ManagementActivity 



Pre-sowing





Common cultural practices: 

 Deep summer ploughing and solarization of soil
 Timely sowing should be done. 
 Field sanitation, rogueing 
 Destroy the alternate host plants
 Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations
 Use resistant varieties 
 Use disease-free certified seeds 
 Crop rotation with non-leguminous crops especially cereals.
 Avoid dense sowing 
 Soil amendment with farm yard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre




Nutrients


 Before sowing, circular pits of 0.5 m cube are dug during summer. 
 Apply well decomposed FYM @ 10-15 Kg per pit




Weeds


At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique i.e. pre-sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in field.




Stem blight, Nematode, Pod borer

Cultural control:

 Follow optimum sowing depth of 5-7 cm.
 Intercropping with mustard and American marigold where nematodes are a problem
 Besides this American marigold also act as trap crop for Helicoverpa armigera.
 Application of FYM/Neem cake or Mahua cake @ 200 Kg/acre.

 Chemical control: 

 Spray chlorpyrifos 20% EC@ 1200ml diluted in 200-400 l of water/acre.(Pod borer)





Sowing/ seedling





Common cultural practices: 

 Timely and line sowing should be done 
 Use healthy, certified and weed free seeds. 
 Sow with proper spacing




Nutrient


 Seed treatment should be done with Rhizobium cultures @ 250 g/acre. 
 At the time of sowing apply phosphatic fertilizers @ 30 g per pit.
In sulphur and zinc deficient areas, apply sulphur and zinc sulphates as per soil test recommendation in soil at the time of sowing.
 Grow sorghum or bajra as intercrop.




Weed management


 Line sowing should be done to facilitate inter-culture operations.
 Plant population should be maintained by gap filling to achieve the optimum plant population and minimize the competition from weed.




Nematodes

Cultural control: 

 Mulching with straw/pine needles/eucalyptus leaves.




Bean mosaic virus

Mechanical control: 

 Rougeing of BMV infected plants




Note: Apply Trichoderma viride/harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens for treatment of seed/seedling/planting materials in the nurseries and field application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim and date of expiry. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).



Vegetative stage





Common cultural practices: 

 Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop 
 Avoid water stress and water stagnation conditions. 
 Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval parasitoids are observed

 Common mechanical practices: 

 Collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae 
 Collect and destroy diseased infected and insect infested plant parts
 Use yellow sticky traps for aphids @ 4-5 traps/acre. 
 Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm 
 Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) 
 Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as King crow, common mynah etc. 
 Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm 

Common biological practices: 

 Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
 Augmentative release of natural enemies




Nutrient


Correct micronutrient deficiency if any in standing crop




Weed    





 Beans suffer severe competition from weeds in initial stages. First 20-30 days after planting is the critical period for crop weed competition. Hand tool weeding at 25 days after sowing is beneficial.




Bean aphid

Cultural control: 

 Regular field monitoring and use sweep net in the morning hours for monitoring of pest and defender population, barrier crops like mustard crop around the field.
 Attractant plants like sunflower are helpful for attraction of predator. 
 Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum or millet to reduce pest population.

Mechanical control:

 Set up yellow sticky traps @4-5 traps/acre 
 Pruning of affected plant parts 
 Use of reflective mulches 
 Spray with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves. 

Biological control: 

 Conserve predators such as ladybird beetles viz., Cocciniella septumpunctata, Menochilus sexmaculata, Hippodamia variegata , Brumus suturalis and Cheilomones vicina etc. Adult beetle feed @10 to15 adults/day.
 Conserve predators such as syrphid flies i.e., Sphaerophoria spp., Eristallis spp., Metasyrphis spp., Xanthogramma spp and Syrphus spp. etc.
 Conserve predators such as lacewing, Chrysoperla zastrowii sillemi etc.
 Spraying of Lecanicillium (Verticilium) lecanii @ 5 g/litre of water
 Spray insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil




Red spider mite

Cultural control: 

 Frequent irrigation during summer season reduces the mite infestation 
 Apart from aforesaid practices, regular monitoring is also mandatory for mites

 Biological control:

 Conserve predators such as Chrysoperla zastrowii sillemi, anthocorid bug, predatory mite (Amblyseius fallacis), coccinellid (Stethorus punctum) etc
