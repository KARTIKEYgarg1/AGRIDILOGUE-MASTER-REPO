Tomato: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*



Nutrients
• Add well rotten farm yard   manure (FYM) @ 8-10 t/acre or vermicompost @ 5 t/ acre. Incorporate at the   time of field preparation at 1 week (vermicompost) or 2 to 3 weeks (FYM)   before transplanting.


Weeds
• At the time of field   preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to minimize the weeds menace in   field. • Keep the nursery weed free by hand pulling of the weeds.


Soil-borne   fungus and nematodes, resting stages of insects
Cultural control: • Deep summer ploughing of fields to control nematodes and exposes dormant   stages (pupa and larva) of Helicoverpa and Spodoptera and subsequently   reduces their initial population build up • Soil solarization: Cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45   mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will   help in reducing the soil-borne pests including weeds. • Ecological engineering of tomato with raising African marigold nursery 15   days prior to tomato nursery serves as a trap crop for ovipositing females of   Helicoverpa. • Apply neem cake @ 100 kg/acre.


Damping off
Cultural control: • Excessive watering and poorly drained areas of field should be   avoided • Use raised beds: 15 cm height is better for water drainage or use   pro-trays for raising seedlings Biological control: • Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride 1 % WP @ 9 g/kg of seed. Chemical control: • Seed treatment with captan 75% WS @ 20-30 g/kg seed • Soil drench with captan 75% WP @ 1000 g in 400 l of water/acre



Seed Sowing/   Transplanting stage*



Nutrients
• Before sowing, soil testing   should be done to find out the soil fertility status. Nutrients should be   provided as per soil test recommendations. Generally, tomato needs 40: 24: 24   kg N: P: K/acre-for varieties and 60: 36: 36 kg N: P: K/acre-for hybrids. • In varieties- Apply 50% of N fertilizer dose as basal before   transplanting. • Apply entire dose of phosphatic fertilizers at the time of last   ploughing/transplanting in case of varieties. • For hybrids, apply nitrogen fertilizer in three equal split doses. First   at the time of last ploughing. • For hybrids, apply potassic fertilizers in two equal splits, first at the   time of last ploughing. • Based on soil test for micronutrients, the deficient micronutrient should   be applied in soil at sowing/transplanting. • Biofertilizers: For seed/seedling treatment with Azotobacter and   phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (PSB) cultures @ 8-10 g each/kg seed • For seedling root dip treatment with Azotobacter and phosphorous   solubilizing bacteria (PSB) cultures @ 250 g each/acre seedlings



Seed and Seedling*



Weed management
• Keep the nursery beds weed   free by hand weeding. • Avoid carrying of weed seedlings along with tomato seedlings • Cultural practices such as crop rotation, line transplanting,   intercropping should be adopted to avoid weeds spread and to suppress the   weed growth.

Bacterial leaf spot
Chemical control: • Spray streptomycin sulfate 9% + tetracycline hydrochloride 1% SP solution   (streptocycline) 40-100 ppm in fields after the appearance of first true   leaves. Two sprays, one before transplanting (seed beds) and another after   transplanting (main field)


Fusarium wilt
Biological control: • Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride 1% WP @ 9 g/kg seed • Root zone application: Mix thoroughly 2.5 kg of the T. viride 1% WP in   150 kg of compost or farmyard manure and apply this mixture in the field   after sowing/ transplanting of crops


Leaf curl
Cultural control: • Raising nursery in protected condition (with net of sufficient mesh size   to prevent the entry of vector, whitefly) • Seeds from disease free healthy plants should be selected for   sowing. • In the nursery all the infected plants should be removed carefully and   destroyed. Seedlings infected with the viral disease should not be used for   transplanting. Chemical control: • Before transplanting dip the roots of seedlings for 15 minutes in   imidacloprid 17.8 % SL @ 60-70 ml in 200 l of water/acre for management of   leaf curl vector.


Nematodes
Cultural control: • Crop rotation with cereal crops • Ecological engineering of tomato with marigold/mustard as intercrops   reduces nematode population • Nursery should be raised in nematode free sites or solarized beds. Chemical control: • Apply dazomet technical @ 12-16 g/acre (nursery)


Serpentine   leaf miner
Cultural control: • Avoid excess use of nitrogen. • Ecological engineering of tomato with beans as intercrop reduces leaf   miner attack.



Vegetative stage



Nutrient   Management
• In varieties, apply the second   dose of N i.e. 13.5 kg N/acre, at 45 days after transplanting. • For hybrids, apply the second dose of N i.e. 20 kg N/acre at 30 days   after planting. • For hybrids, apply the second dose of potassic fertilizers at 30 days   after planting. • Micronutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of   particular micronutrient.


Weed management
• Field should be weed free   before 30 days crop stage. Two hoeings between the rows plus hand weeding   within the row at 15 and 30 days after planting. • Mulching with black Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) sheets of 30 micron   thickness by burying both the ends into the soil to a depth of 10 cm will   avoid weed growth.
