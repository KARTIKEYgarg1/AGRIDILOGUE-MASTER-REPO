Black Pepper: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*




Common cultural practices: •Deep ploughing of fields during summer to control nematodes population, to   expose pupae and popagules of soil borne pathogens. •Soil solarization can be done for sterilizing the nursery mixture •Timely sowing should be done. •Field sanitation, rogueing. •Destroy the alternate host plants •Crop rotation with non-cereals. •Adopt ecological engineering by growing the attractant, repellent, and   trap crops around the field bunds.


Nutrients
•Prepare pits of the size 50 x   50 x 50 cm before the onset of the monsoon at a spacing of 2 to 3 m in either   direction. Slopes facing West and South should be avoided. •Fill it up after the onset of   monsoon with FYM @10 Kg + Neem cake1 Kg + bone meal and Rock phosphate 70 g +   top soil. Wherever possible a large pit filled with alternate layers of   coconut husk and the above mixture is preferable. This will help in   conserving soil moisture and help the young plants to survive the hot summer.   Plant rooted cuttings in June – July.


Weeds
•Destroy all the weeds from   planting area by ploughing during summer. •Remove all the perennial weds and their rhizomes/suckers before onset of   monsoon.


Soil   and seed borne pathogens, Pests and nematodes
Cultural control: •Planting material must be collected from disease free garden or nursery   raised preferably in fumigated soil. •Well drained level land and hill slopes are suitable for growing pepper,   slopes facing south and south western side should be avoided and north and   north eastern slopes should be preferred. •Cultivated varieties such as Naryankodi, kalluvally, Uthirankotta and   Balancotta which are tolerant to quick wilt •Press the soil around the cutting to form a small mound slopping outward   and away from cuttings to prevent water stagnation around the plants •Adequate mulch with green leaf saw dust or coir dust or organic matter   should be given towards the end of the north-eastern monsoon. •Injury to root system to be avoided at any cost. •About 10 Kg of well rotten cattle manure or compost to be given in April   may in order to support antagonistic fungi. •Growing cover crops like Calapogonium muconoides, Mimosa invisa are also   recommended under west coast conditions to provide an effective soil cover to   prevent soil erosion as well as spread of soil borne pathogens in rainy   seasons and for thick organic mulch during summer. •Planting materials must be collected from disease free garden and   nurseries raised preferably in fumigated soil. Mechanical control: •The affected cutting along with defoliated leaves should be removed from   nursery and destroyed. Biological control: •Alternatively, Rhizobacteria like IISR 853 can be applied @ 1 g   (formulations containing 108 - 1010 cfu/g) at monthly intervals. •Apply neem /mustard/castor cake



Sowing/planting*



Nutrients
•In addition, organic manure   application before planting, apply 50 g Azospirillum + 50 g PSB + 200 g VAM   per plant at the time of planting.


Weeds
•Hand weeding around the plants   is to be done according to necessity •Adequate mulch with green leaf or organic matter should be given towards   the end of north east monsoon. •Recommended dose of fertilizers is to be applied. Care should be taken to   avoid direct contact of fertilizers with the roots of pepper. •Water logging is to be avoided.


Nematodes/Borers
Cultural control: •With the receipt of the first rain in May-June, primary stem   cuttings of Erythrina sp.(Murukku) or Garuga pinnata (kilinjil) or Grevillea robusta (silver oak) are planted in pits of 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm size   filled with cow dung and top soil, at a spacing of 3 m x 3 m which would   accommodate about 1110 standards per hectare (Seedlings of Alianthus   malabarica (Matti) can also be planted and the black pepper vines can be   trailed on it after 3 years when they attain sufficient height). •Pits of 50 cm 3 at a distance of 30 cm away from the base, on the northern   side of supporting tree are taken with the onset of monsoon. •The pits are filled with a mixture of top soil, farmyard manure @ five   Kg/pit and 150 g rock phosphate. With the onset of monsoon, two-three rooted   cuttings of black pepper are planted individually in the pits on the northern   side of each standard. At least one node of the cutting Should be kept below the soil for better anchorage. •Follow the spacing recommended 3 m X 3 m in plain lands and 2 m X 4 m in   sloppy lands. Botanical control: •Neem cake @ 1 Kg /vine may be mixed with the soil at the time of planting.



Vegetative




Common cultural practices: •Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop •Avoid water stress and   water stagnation conditions. •Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval   parasitoids are observed Common mechanical practices: •Collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae •Removal and destruction of dead vines along with root system from the   garden is essential as this reduces the build up of inoculum (fungal   population). •Collect and destroy diseased and insect infected plant parts •Use yellow sticky trap for aphid vector control and blue sticky traps for   thrips @ 4-5 traps/acre. •Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm •Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as   King crow, common mynah etc. •Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: •Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering •Augmentative release of natural enemies.


Nutrients

•Fertilizers should be applied   on the basis of soil test report and recommendation for the particular area.   In general, fertilizers may be applies as mentioned in Table 1. Table 1. Fertilizers requirement of black pepper

 •Fertilizer should be applied 10-15 days after pruning of the living   supports. •If soil is highly acidic 500g lime per vine also is to be applied in   alternate years. •During the first year,1/3rd of the dosage recommended for the adult vines   should be applied during September. •During the second year, two thirds of the dosage recommended for the adult   vines should be applied in two equal instalments, one during May-June, and   the other during September-October. •The manures and fertilizers are applied around the vine at a distance of   30 cm from the base and incorporated into the soil.



Weeds
•Pull out weeds before flowering   by 2-3 rounds of hand weeding.  •Slash weeding is a cost-effective method and to keep a cover always over   the soil. •Mulching with dry/green leaves or   organic matter @ 10Kg should be given to control weed growth and to prevent   sun scorching of young vines during summer.


Phytophthora   foot rot (quick wilt), basal wilt
Cultural control: •Planting material must be collected from disease free gardens and the   nursery preferably raised in fumigated or solarized soil. •Adequate drainage should be provided to reduce water stagnation. •Injury to the root system due to cultural practices such as digging should   be avoided. •The freshly emerging runner shoots should not be allowed to trail on the   ground. They must either be tied back to the standard or pruned off. •The branches of support trees must be pruned at the onset of monsoon to   avoid build up of humidity and for better penetration of sunlight. •Reduced humidity and presence of sunlight reduces the intensity of leaf   infection. Chemical control: For foot rot: •Metalaxyl M 4% + Mancozeb 64% WP @ 0.25%, 2 or 3 l/vine •Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP @ 0.125 %, 2 or 5 l/vine


Slow wilt
Cultural control: •Nematode free root cutting raised in fumigated nursery mixture should be   used for fresh planting. •Remove the severely affected vines which are beyond recovery.


Pollu   beetle, Top shoot borer, Leaf gall thrips
Cultural control: •Regulation of shade in the plantation reduces the population of the pest   in the field. •For others follow common practices. Biological control: •Spraying Neemgold (0.6 per cent) (neem-based insecticide) during August,   September and October is effective for the management of the pest. The   underside of leaves (where adults are generally seen) and spikes are to be   sprayed thoroughly. •For biological control follow common practices.


Mealybugs
Cultural control: •Removal of weeds and alternate host plants like hibiscus, bhindi, custard   apple, guava etc in and nearby vineyards throughout the year. •Deep ploughing in summer or raking of soil in vineyards helps to destroy   its nymphal stages and minimizing the incidence. Biological control: •Release exotic predator, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri @ 10   beetles/vine. Physical control: •Detrash the crop on 150 and 210 DAP.


Scale   insects, Minor pests
Cultural control: •Follow common practices. Biological control: •In nurseries spraying neem oil 0.3 per cent or Neem gold 0.3 per cent or   fish oil rosin three per cent is also effective in controlling the pest   infestation. •Follow common biological practices.
