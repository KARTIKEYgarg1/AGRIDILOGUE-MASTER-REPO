Cumin Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Timely sowing should be done. • Field sanitation, rogueing • Deep summer ploughing to control juveniles and adults of nematodes, and   resting stages of insect pests. • Sow the ecological engineering plants • Sow/plant sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around cumin crop as a   guard/barrier crop • Destroy the alternate host plants • Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations • Follow crop rotation


Nutrients
• Soil is brought to fi ne tilth   by 2-3 ploughing with harrow or desi plough. Stubbles of previous crops   should be collected and removed from the field. Clods should be broken and   field should be leveled with the help of plank. • Beds of 4 m x 3 m size with provision of irrigation channels should be   prepared before sowing of seeds to facilitate proper irrigation and   intercultural operations. • Incorporate 6-8 t FYM/acre in soil, 2-3 weeks before sowing.


Weeds
• Soil solarization during   summer at the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to   minimize weeds menace in the field.


Soil   borne pathogens, nematodes and resting stages of insect pests
Cultural control: • Soil solarization: Cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45   mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing which will help in reducing the   soil borne pests. • Apply organic amendment i.e. mustard, castor or neem cake 8-10   qts/acre



Sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Use resistant/tolerant varieties. • Select healthy, certified, and weed seed free seeds


Nutrients
• Apply 15 Kg nitrogen (N) and   15 Kg phosphorus (P) at the time of sowing as basal dose. Another, 15 Kg N   should be applied as topdressing one month after germination of seeds. • In zinc deficient areas, apply zinc sulphate @ 8 Kg/acre.


Weeds
• Sowing/transplanting should be   done in lines to facilitate hoeing and weeding operations during vegetative   stage. • Adopt recommended agronomic practices like timely sowing, proper spacing   irrigation etc. to obtain the healthy plant stand.



Vegetative stage





Common cultural practices: • Collect and destroy crop debris • Judicious use of fertilizers • Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • Avoid water logging • Avoid any stress to the crop as much as possible • Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval   parasitoids are observed
 Common mechanical practices: • Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant   parts • Collect and destroy eggs and early stage larvae • Handpick the older larvae during early stages of the crop • Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on   stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. • Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • Erect bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as King   crow, common mynah etc. • Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm
 Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies



Nutrients
• Apply second half of N (6Kg   /acre) as top dressing at 30 days after germination of the seed.


Weeds
• The crop should be kept free   from weeds for initial 20 to 40 days for proper growth and development of   plants. • Generally hand tool weeding/ hoeing at 20 and 40 days after sowing are   required to keep the weeds under check • Apply oxadiargyl 6% EC @ 24-30 ml/acre in 200 l of water at 15-20 days   after germination of seeds to control Cyperus iria, Cyperus diff ormis,   Eclipta alba, Ludwigia quadrifoliata, Chenopodium album, Rumex sp, Melilotus   indica, Asphodelus tenuifolius


Alternaria blight
• See the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Chemical control: • Spray aureofungin 46.15% w/v. SP @ 0.02% in 300 l of water, second spray   after 30 days of interval or copper oxy chloride 50% WP @ 1.0 Kg/ acre in   300- 400 l of water or difenoconazole 25% EC @ 0.05% in 200 l of water,   second spray after 15 days of interval or mancozeb 75%WP @ 0.6- 0.8 Kg/ acre   in 200 l of water or zineb 75% WP @ 0.6- 0.8 Kg/ acre in 200 l of water


Wilt
• See the common cultural, mechanical and biological practices


Powdery mildew
• See the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Chemical control: • Spray aureofungin 46.15%w/v. SP @ 0.02% in 300 l water, second spray   after 30 of interval or difenoconazole 25% EC @ 0.05% in 200 l water, second   spray after 15 days of interval or sulphur 40% WP @ 1.4 Kg/ acre in 400 l of   water or sulphur 80% WG @ 0.75-1.0 Kg/ acre in 300-400 l of water or sulphur   85% DP @ 6-8 Kg/acre or dinocap 48% EC @ 120 ml/acre in 300 l of water


Aphid, Jassid**
• See the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Spray the pressurized water on the crop. Biological control: • Apply fish oil rosin soap or NSKE (3%), neem oil (2%) or tobacco   decoction (0.05%).


Thrips
• See the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Biological control: • Apply fish oil rosin soap or NSKE (3%), neemoil (2%) or tobacco decoction   (0.05%).


Tobacco caterpillar**
• See the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Ecological engineering by growing of ovipositional trap crops such as   castor.


Cutworm**
• See the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Deep summer ploughing of fields during summer months in the plains and   during autumn in the hills. • Attracting cutworm larvae using rice bran – heaps of rice bran should be   placed in several places in the late afternoon. Larvae can be removed from   the rice bran on the next day and destroyed. • Flood field prior to planting- where/whenever possible farmers can   consider temporarily flooding fields, particularly on severely infested   fields



Reproductive stage



Nutrients
• Incorporate crop residues in soil immediately after harvest.


Weeds
• Remove left over weeds before   shedding of the seeds to prevent further spread of weeds


Insect-pest &amp; diseases
• Same as in vegetative stage


Storage pests


Cigarette beetle**
Mechanical control: • Sticky traps baited with the female sex pheromone, • Store grains in gunny bags with moisture proof lining • Use commercially available cigarette beetle traps with synthetic   serricornin


Drugstore Beetle**
Mechanical control: • Use commercially available traps and lures with the drugstore beetle sex   pheromone, stegobinone (2,3-dihydro-2,3,5-trimethy l-6-(1-methyl-2oxobutyl)   -4H-pyran-4-one) • Use sticky traps baited with the female sex pheromone, stegobinone, for   monitoring adult beetles


Note: Pesticides dosages and spray fluid volume are based on   high volume sprayer *Apply Trichoderma viride/ harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens as seed   treatment and soil application (If commercial products are used, check for   label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption   in their fields, registration is not required). ** Pests of regional significance
