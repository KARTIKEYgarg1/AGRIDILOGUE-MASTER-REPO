Attractant/Repellent/Trap plants


Shoot borer:


•   Parasitoids: Bracon sp (larval), myosoma sp (larval), Apanteles sp (larval) ,   Xanthopimpla sp (larval and pupal) etc., • Predators: Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi, coccinellids, king crow, wasp,   dragonfly, spiders, robber fly, reduviid bug, praying mantids, fire ants   Entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) of the genus Rhabditis/Oscheius and   Hexamermis sp.
• Attractant plants for natural   enemies: Carrot family, sunflower family, buckwheat, alfalfa, corn, shrubs   (lacewing and ladybird beetle). • Nectar rich plants with small flowers i.e. anise, caraway, dill, parsley,   mustard, sunflower, buckwheat and cowpea (braconid wasp) • Maintaining hedgerows around the turmeric plantation also helps to   maintain a population of ladybird beetle, spiders, etc. • Mulching with green leaves @ 4–4.5 t/acre at the time of planting. It is   repeated @ 2 t/acre at 40 and 90 days after planting. • Use of Lantana camara and Vitex negundo as mulch at the time of planting   may reduce the infection of shoot borer. • EPN Rhabditis/Oscheius as biopesticides for management of the shoot borer   and other insect pests of turmeric.


Soft rot:



• Incorporation of neem cake and   pine needle in the soil. • Different types of cropping systems cropping like maize, papaya,   cucumber, pumpkin, yam, tapioca and different types of leguminous   crops. • Application of oil cakes made from Azadirachta indica, Calophyllumino   phyllum, Pongamia glabra, Hibiscus sabdariffa and Brassica campestris • Intercrop ginger with maize and pineapple.


Bacterial wilt:


Plant Growth Promoting   Rhizobacteria (PGPR)
• Raised bed 30 cm with 1 meter   width. • Crop rotation with maize, cotton, and soybean. • Incorporation of Pseudomonas spp. AM and other BCAs @ 1Kg/per acre with   well decomposed FYM • AM fungi


Fusarium wilt or   yellows:



• Raised bed. • Practice Biodisinfestation procedures like soil incorporation of   cruciferous plants, soil solarisation during hottest months for 60   days. • Apply pine needle and neem cake powder soil treatments.


Root-knot nematode:



• Intercropping with marigold @   5:1 • Deep ploughing or solarized beds of infested fields during summer. • Repellant plants for nematodes: Marigold plantation, Gliricidia,   Asparagus, Dahelia etc. • Crop rotation: Marigold, Chrysanthemum, Sesbania, Crotalaria spp.,   Gaillardia, castor bean and Desmodium spp., • Border crops: Strips of rye grass, cover crops and mulch beds (rove   beetle) • Soil incorporation of Gliricidia compost, neem cake 0.8 t / acre
