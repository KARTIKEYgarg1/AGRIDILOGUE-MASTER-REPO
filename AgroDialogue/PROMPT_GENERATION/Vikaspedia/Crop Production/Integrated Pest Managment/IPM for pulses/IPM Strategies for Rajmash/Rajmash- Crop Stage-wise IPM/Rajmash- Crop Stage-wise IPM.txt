Rajmash: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Stage   wise Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*




Common   cultural practices: · Deep ploughing of fields during summer to control nematodes population,   to expose pupae;propagules of soil borne pathogens and to reduce the weeds   infestation.. · Soil solarization · Timely sowing should be done. · Field sanitation, rogueing. · Destroy the alternate host plants · Growing pea or marigold as a trap crop for the management of Leaf   miner. · Plant tall border crops like mustard for the management of aphids. · Crop rotation with non leguminous crops especially cereals. · Adopt ecological engineering by growing the recommended attractant,   repellent, and trap crops around the field bunds.ommon cultural practices:


Nutrients
·   Fertilizers should be applied on the basis of soil test values and   recommendations for particular agro-ecological regions. · Apply 4-5 tons of farmyard manure or vermicompost @1.5-2 t/acre at the   time of last cultivation and incorporate in the soil 2 to 3 weeks before   sowing. · Incubate Trichoderma @ 500g in 100 Kg FYM for 15 days prior to its   application in one acre field


Weeds
·   At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique i.e. pre   sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in   field.


Root rot, Stem rot, Nematode, Pod borer
·   Application of FYM/Neem or Mahua cake @ 200 Kg/acre. · Seed treatment with Trichoderma @ 5 g/Kg seed



Sowing*



Nutrients
·   Seed treatment should be done with Rhizobium cultures @5-10 g/Kg seed. · French bean needs liberal N fertilization (40-45 Kg/acre) because of poor   nodulation. The crop requires 25 Kg P2O5/acre. If K status in soil is   marginal also apply 10-15 Kg K2O/acre · In sulphur and zinc deficient areas, apply sulphur and zinc sulphate each   @ 10 Kg/ acre in soil at the time of sowing.


Weeds
·   Always use certified and weed free seeds. · Line sowing should be done to facilitate inter-culture operations. · Plant population should be maintained to its optimum right from its   beginning to minimize the crop- weed competition. · Intercropping with crops like maize in kharif and mustard in rabi


Root rots, ematodes, Stem fly, Anthracnose, BCMV
Cultural   control: · Select healthy and disease free seeds. · The seeds should be thoroughly rinsed and dried in shade. · Mulching with straw/pine needles/eucalyptus leaves. · Avoid dense sowing. · Sowing in well drained soil. · Follow optimum sowing depth of 5-7 cm. · Intercropping with mustard where nematodes are the problem.


*Application of Trichoderma harzianum/ viride and Pseudomonas   fluorescens for treatment of seed/seedling/planting materials in the   nurseries and field application (if commercial products are used, check for   label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption   in their fields, registration is not required).



Vegetative




Common   cultural practices: · Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop · Avoid water stress   and water stagnation conditions. · Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval   parasitoids are observed Common mechanical practices: · Collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae · Collect and destroy diseased infected and insect infested plant   parts · Use yellow sticky traps for aphids and leaf miner @ 4-5 traps/acre. · Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm · Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) · Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such   as King crow, common mynah etc. · Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: · Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering · Augmentative release of natural enemies.


Nutrients
·   Correct micronutrient deficiency if any in standing crop.


Weeds
·   Rajmash suffers severe competition from weeds in initial stages. First 30-40   days after sowing is the critical period for crop- weed competition. Hand   tool weeding at 20 &amp; 40 days after sowing should be done for the   management of weeds.


Aphids
Cultural   control: · Reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from   feeding on plants. · Sturdy plants can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids   from leaves Biological control: · See common biological practices. · Insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the   best method of control; always check the labels of the products for specific   usage guidelines prior to use.


Leaf miner
·   See common cultural and biological practices.


Mosaic
Cultural   control: · Control the vector by adopting common practices for the aphid. Mechanical practices: · All the infected plants should be removed carefully from the field and   destroyed.


Angular leaf spot**, Anthracnose and rust**
Cultural   control: · Balance use of manures and fertilizers. · Mulching with pine needles or eucalyptus leaves reduces the angular leaf   spot.



Flowering/Pod   stage



Nutrients
·   Incorporate crop residues in soil immediately after harvest.


Weeds
·   Remove left over weeds before shedding of seeds to prevent weed seed spread   in the subsequent year.


Pod borer
·   See common cultural practices. Biological control: · Inundative release T. pretiosum @ 40,000/acre 4-5 times from flower   initiation stage at weekly intervals. · Apply entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) Steinernema feltiae @ 8 billion   infective juveniles/acre.


Stem fly**, Blister beetle**, Stem boring weevil**, Flower beetle**
·   See common cultural practices. · Collect the beetle and kill them.


Aphid, leaf miner
·   Same as vegetative stage.


Angular leaf spot**, Anthracnose and rust**
·   Same as vegetative stage.



Post harvest



Seed borne fungi, Rust**, White rot, Anthracnose
·   Collect crop residue from the field after crop harvest and burn them. · Clean the seeds properly, remove broken or shriveled grains. · Dry the seeds properly and store in air tight seed bins.



Rodent   management



Smaller bandicoot

Cultural   control: · Practice clean cultivation/maintain weed free fields which reduces the   harboring/hiding points for rodents. · Practice trapping with locally available traps using lure @ 20-25   traps/ac. In areas, where bandicoot is a problem, wonder traps/multi-catch   traps work better and enable to trap more animals int a single trap. · Identify live rodent burrows and smoke the burrows with burrow smoker for   2-3 minutes · Erect owl perches @ 12-15/ac to promote natural control of rodents Chemical control: · In cases of high level of infestation (&gt;50 live burrows/ac) practice   poison baiting with zinc phosphide @ 2.0% on community approach.
PRACTICE   PRE-BAITING TO AVOID BAIT SHYNESS Day 1: Close all the burrows in the fields, field bunds, canal bunds and   surrounding barren lands etc. Day 2: Count the re-opened burrows and practice pre-baiting @ 20 g/burrow   (98 parts of broken rice + 2 parts of edible oil) Day 4: Observe the re-opened burrows and treat the burrow with zinc   phosphide poison bait (96 parts of broken rice + 2 parts of edible oil + 2   parts of zinc phosphide) @ 10g/ burrow. Collect the dead rats, if found any   outside and bury them.
