 Tea Crop Stage Wise  IPM





 Management Activity



Pre-planting





Common cultural practices:

 Deep ploughing of fields during summer to control nematodes population. 
Soil solarization 
 Field sanitation, rogueing.
 Destroy the alternate host plants 
 Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations.
 Growing castor, pea or marigold as a trap crop for the management of Leaf miner and Spodoptera.
 Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum or millet to reduce pest population
Adopt ecological engineering by growing the attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the field bunds




Nutrients


Apply nutrients on the basis of soil test report and recommendation for the agro-climatic zone.


 Soils having pH around 5.0 are suitable for tea plantation. 
 For new plantation pits of 30 x 45 x 60 cm size are dug.
 For application in nursery, a nutrient mixture should be prepared with following composition;
 Composition of the nutrient mixture: Ammonium phosphate (20:20) 35 g, Muriate of Potash,12 g, Magnesium sulphate 15 g, Zinc sulphate 3 g.
 This nutrient mixture is applied in nursery @ 30 g dissolved in 10 litres of water over an area of 4 sq.m. This should be done fortnightly.




Weeds

Cultural control:

 Deep plouging during summer
 Stale seed bed technique
 Keep boundaries of tea field weed free to prevent dispersal of weed seed into the tea field.
 Field should be well prepared by tillage operations and after tillage; the underground reproductive propagules of weeds must be collected and destroyed. 
 Digging out of tubers and rhizomes of weeds is discouraged to prevent re-infestation from fragmented underground propagules.




Insect pests and soil borne diseases

Cultural control:

Field Sanitation: Weeds like Mikania cordata, Bidens biternata, Emillia sp., Polygonum Chinese and Lantana camara offer excellent hiding places and serve as alternate host for the tea masquito bug. Growth of weeds and wild host plants near in and around tea field may be controlled and this will help to reduce the  growth of tea mosquito population. 
For other adopt common practices.




Termites

Cultural control: 

 Bushes should be properly cleaned out at the time of pruning by removing the snags, dead and diseased branches. Any earthen materials like earth runs over the trunk and stems, earth depositions on the collar of the bushes should be wiped out/removed at the time of pruning
 Pruning cuts should be painted with indopaste or copper fungicide or Trichoderma bio-cide. Remains of old shade tree stumps inside the sections should also be cleaned and treated/removed permanently.
 Improve drainage condition in the termite prone fields. 
 Improve shade status of the tea fields. 
Destroy termite mounds and queens. Remove earth runs and fork the soil around collar region of the infested tea bushes/ shade trees before application of pesticides. 
 Weeds like grasses etc. within radius of 30cm from the collar region of the bushes should be cleaned. 
 In tea sections where live wood eating termite is noticed, the mulching materials should also be sprayed with recommended chemicals. 
 Keep the soil is in moist condition for effective spraying and control. Slight irrigation before and after spraying improves condition of the (hard and dry) soil for absorption of pesticide.




Nematodes

Cultural control: 

 Soil from the nursery site should be tested for eelworm population and acidity status. If the population of eelworm is found to be 6 or above per10g of soil tested, it is considered to be unsuitable for use.
 Preparation of the nursery bed should be done by harrowing and ploughing to expose and dry the un-decomposed weeds and roots of the plants. All sorts of mulching materials should be kept away from the seed nursery to avoid nematode infestation. 
 Plant parasitic nematodes can be killed by uniform heating (after sieving) of the soil up to 60° – 70°C for 4-5 minutes on plain tin sheets. The soil can be used after heat treatment.
 Removal of weed hosts from nursery beds will help in minimizing the population build-up. 
 Soil sampling in the estates is should be systematic following appropriate procedure to avoid errors in the assessment of eelworm. 

Chemical control: 

 Carbofuran 3% CG@ 33.10 g/plant





Nursery and seedling



Weeds


 Use the certified and weed free seeds or healthy cuttings.
 Keep the nursery weed free by hand pulling of the weeds





Planting



Nutrients


Pits are filled with top soil and organic manure mixed with Trichoderma




Weeds


 Closer spacing of tea plants, inter-planting, and use of quick growing planting materials will help uniform ground coverage and thereby reduce weed growth.
 Plant cover crop/green manure between rows to avoid ground exposure. 
 Use weed free compost and straw mulches.
Mulching with biodegradable materials after planting or preemergent herbicides like Oxyflourfen 23.5% EC @ 260 -400 l in 200-300 l of water/acre within 2-3 days after planting may be used if weed flora (Digiteria, Imperata, Paspalum) of the field is known based on previous year.




Nematode and soil borne diseases

Cultural control:

 Select healthy and disease free seeds.
 Use resistant tolerant varieties.
 Miling with straw/pine needles/eucalyptus leaves.




Mites

Cultural control: 

 Grow nurseries away from infested crops and avoid planting next to infested fields 
 Grow healthy crops; avoid water and nutrient stress
 Apply mulch and incorporate organic matter into the soil to improve the water holding capacity and reduce evaporation
 Keep perennial hedges such as pigeon peas, they are said to encourage predatory mites





Vegetative





Common cultural practices:

 Collect and destroy diseased and insect infected plant parts. 
 Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop
 Avoid water stress and water stagnation conditions. 
 Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed

 Common mechanical practices: 

 Collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae 
 Handpick the older larvae during early stages
 The infested shoots may be collected and destroyed 
 Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. 
 Use yellow sticky traps for aphids and leaf minor and blue sticky trap for thrips @ 4-5 trap/acre. 
 Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm
 Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) 
 Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as King crow, common mynah etc. 
 Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm 

Common biological practices:

Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering Augmentative release of natural enemies.




Nutrients


Manuring of young tea commences two months after planting. The ratio and source of nutrients vary according to soil reaction (pH). 
 Rates of fertilizer are kept slightly higher in soils with pH above 5. 
 Apply phosphorus at 36 Kg/acre every year in one application.
Application of fertilizers should be done before the onset of monsoon. Fertilizers should be broadcast around the drip circle avoiding contact with the collar.

Weeds




 Remove the major weeds and creepers like Mikania micrantha by hand weeding or slashing.
 Use “Cheel hoe” with a half-moon shaped blade in freshly planted areas for scraping the above ground parts of the weeds and leveling the local depressions in the ground.
 Cut the top growth of weeds in young tea areas with sickles. But perennial grasses like Imperata, Saccharum etc. should be removed.
 Since mulching cannot be done near to the collar of the plant, removal of sporadic weed growth is necessary.
 Weeds removed from the field should be taken outside the cropped area and heaped. Regrowth of rhizomatous and tuberous weeds inside the heap should be removed periodically. Before using in compost-pits, proper decomposition of all vegetative propagules must be ensured.
 While practicing strip weeding in slopes the uncontrolled strip should be subjected to manual slashing
In mature tea areas, where pruning is due in the later months, one time winter application of any one of the below listed herbicide may be adopted as per weed infestation in the field as post emergence  application, when weeds are young and at active vegetative growth stage. Rotation of available herbicides will take care of plant succession and herbicidal resistance.

Red rust

Cultural control: 

 If vigour of plant is maintained by balanced nutrients, the disease is less. 
 As the disease starts on the onset of rain, it is desired to spray fungicide twice during the month of July/ August at 15 days intervals. 
 Avoid plant stress. Avoid poorly drained sites. Promote good air circulation in the plant canopy to reduce humidity and duration of leaf wetness. 
 Identify and correct predisposing factors such as- poor drainage, low soil fertility, particularly potash, improper soil acidity, inadequate shade and continuous use of green crops like Tephrosia candida, T. vogelli etc. in addition to pruning of severely  affected sections

Biological control:

 Give alkaline wash after pruning. 
 Shorter pruning cycle helps in minimizing infestation.




Charcoal stump rot, Collar and branch canker, Grey blight, Die back

Cultural control:

 Remove the affected portion during rejuvenation. 
 Avoid intensive harvesting using flat shears. 
 Maintain a proper balance of nitrogen and potassium fertilizers. 
 Avoidance of predisposing factors
 Avoid mulching and fertilizer application close to the stem collar and planting in gravelly soil. 
 Avoid plant stress. Grow tea bushes with adequate spacing to permit air to circulate and reduce humidity and the duration of leaf wetness. 
 Prohibit the entry of workers of the infested section into the healthy sections.

 Biological control: 

 Spray 2-4 rounds of 5% aqueous extracts of Amphineuron opulentum/ Cassia alata/ Polygonum sinensis at 15 days interval.





Maturity/Flowering



Nutrients

As per table above.

 The rate of fertilizer application for mature tea varies with yield and soil test values while the N: K2O ratio varies with the stage of pruning.
 Apply the recommended quantity of mixtures along the drip circle of plants. In the semi-circular furrow taken above the plant on the slope. 
 Apply the fertilizers when there is adequate soil moisture and when the fields are free from weeds. 
 Punch holes of 15-22 cm depth in the soil on either side of the plants and place the rock phosphate.




Weeds


 Remove the weeds before shedding of their seeds to reduce the weed infestation in the subsequent season.
 Hand weeding around collar region of young tea bushes is always safe and it should be done. 
 Care should be taken so that the weeds do not flower and seeds infest the new areas, drains and estate boundaries.




Tea mosquito bug

Cultural control: 

 When an attack by Helopeltis becomes unmanageable the affected bushes may be skiffed to reduced the damage. Medium prune (60-70 cm) is best suited for shot-hole borer infested fields  (except when other factors demand a different height of pruning). Longer pruning cycles will tend to increase the intensity of borer damage, especially in mid and low elevation areas.
The tea mosquito bug lay large number of eggs on the broken ends of plucked shoots. Intensive manual removal of stalks during plucking will help to reduce the incidence of the tea mosquito bug.


 Removal of the alternate host of H. theivora such as Guava (Psidium guajava), Oak (Quercus spp.), Melastoma (Melastoma sp.), Thoroughwort (Eupatorium sp.), Fragrant thoroughwort (Eupatorium odoratum), Dayflower (Commelina spp.), Sesbania (Sesbania cannibina), Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophylla), Bortengeshi (Oxalis acetocello), Ornamental jasmine (Gardenia jesminoid), Mulberry (Morus alba), Kadam (Enthocephalus cadamba), Jamun (Eugenia jambolana), Boal (Ehretia acuminata), Mikania (Mikania micrantha), Acacia moniliformis, Duranta repens, Piper hemiltonii, Phlogacanthus thirsyfiorus, Ficus benjamina, Sida cordifolia, Cannabium sativam, Ixora sp, Persea bomycina, Pteridium aquilium, Murraya koenigii and Premna latifolia from in and around plantations would give a good control. Wild plants (noneconomic) nearby the fields having feeding spots of H. theivora have to be eradicated, as far as possible.
 The ecotone (border) between forest line and tea plantation need to be kept clear of weed and noneconomic plants.
H. theivora prefers moist conditions and mild temperatures. For that reason, populations of this pest are often higher under heavy shade. Regulate the shade in densely shaded area areas lopping of the lower branches of shade trees. Moderate shade of 60% is preferable.

 Biological control:

 See common practices. 
 Applying native plant crude aquaus extracts viz. Clerodendrum viscosum (Dhopat tita/ Ghato), Polygonum hydropiper (Pothorua bihlonganii), Cassia alata (Khor pat), Xanthium strumarium, Vitex negundo and Amphineuron Sp (Bitter fern) @ 5% concentration may also be done in case of low and moderate infestation of the pest. 
 Entomopathogen, Beauveria bassiana @ 1.2 Kg/acre minimized infestation of H. theivora in field condition. 

Chemical control: 

 Clothianidin 50% WDG @ 48 g in 200 l of water/acre or Profenofos 50% EC @ 320-400 ml in 160 l of water/acre or Thiacloprid 21.7% SC@ 150 ml in 160 l of water/acre or Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 40 g in 160-200 ml of water/acre




Thrips

Cultural control: 

 The recommendation on shade management, if adopted, will help to prevent the excessive built up of thrips and mites 
 For other see common practices. 
 Caustic washing of the trunk of the bushes after cleaning the mosses and lichens and stirring of soil around the collar region will kill the pupae. 
Biological control: 
See common practices.

Mites (red, pink, yellow scarlet, and purple)

Cultural control:

 The recommendation on shade management, if adopted, will help to prevent the excessive built up of mites. 
 Apply mulch and incorporate organic matter into the soil to improve the water holding capacity and reduce evaporation
 Uproot and burn infested plants. This can be successful during the early stages of infestation when the mites concentrate on a few plants 
 Keep the field free of weeds
 Remove and burn infested crop residues immediately after harvest
 The bushes along the motorable roads, which remain covered with dust are very often found to be severely attacked by red spider mite. Protect the roadside bushes from dust by growing hedge plants like Phlogacenthus thrysiflorus (titaphool) or applying water on such dusty roads at regular intervals is a good practice for management of red spider mite.
 To prevent migration of red spider mites by restricting the pluckers from entering into un-infested areas from infested areas and cattle trespass inside the tea sections should be stopped. 
 Removal of alternate hosts (Borreria hispida, Scoparia dulcis,  Melochia corchorifolia and Fussiala suffruticosa) in and around plantations would give a good control 
 The bushes in ill drained or waterlogged areas are subject to increased red spider damage, than those in well drained areas. Therefore, inadequate drainage is not only harmful to the tea plants but also creates conditions conducive to the buildup of O. coffeae.
 Red spider mite incidence is high on the bushes receiving heavier doses of nitrogen but potash and phosphorus application decreased the amount of red spider in tea. Therefore, appropriate fertilization practice is necessary. 
 Red spider mite affected fields should get a new tier of maintenance foliage since the infested bushes are very week due to defoliation of maintenance leaves.
 Measures should be taken (Two rounds of spray at 15 days interval) during December and January in Young and Un-prune Tea; Skiffed tea – February; Pruned tea – Early March. 
 After severe attacks of mite two rounds of applications must be followed at an interval of 7 – 10 days (April – October- 7 days and Nov – March-10 days). 
 Coverage of both surfaces and foliage is necessary. During full cropping seasons control measures should be undertaken as spot treatment only. 
 For pruned tea monitoring is necessary soon after tipping.
 Avoid spraying during middle hours of the day in sunny weather. 
Thorough drenching of top, middle and bottom hamper of bushes with spray fluid is necessary to kill the residual population. 
 The crude water extracts of native plants viz. Clerodendrum viscosum, Melia azadirach, Vitex negundo, Gliricidia maculata, Wedelia chinensis, Morinda tinctoria, Pongamia glabra, neem kernel, pongam kernel, garlic, Swietenia mahagoni seeds, Pongamia pinnata seeds, Sophora flavescens, Acorus calamus rhizomes, Xanthium strumarium, Clerodendron infortunatum, Aegle marmelos, Clerodendron inerme, Phlogocanthus tubiflorus, Achanthus aspera, Artemisia nilagirica, Phyllanthus amarus and Lantana camara showed great promise in controlling red spider mite population at field level.
