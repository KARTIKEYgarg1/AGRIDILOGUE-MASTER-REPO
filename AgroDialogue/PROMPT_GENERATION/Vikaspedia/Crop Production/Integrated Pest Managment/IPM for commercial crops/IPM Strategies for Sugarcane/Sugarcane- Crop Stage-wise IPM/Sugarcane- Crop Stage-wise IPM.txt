Sugarcane: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre – sowing*



Nutrients
Soil test based nutrient   recommendations should be followed also, • Apply organic manures @ 8 to 10 tonnes/acre treated with   Trichoderma. • Press mud can also be used as organic manure @ 2 tonnes/acre which is   particularly useful in saline alkali soils. • Sugarcane trash can be used as a mulch. Spray trash with 32 Kg urea, 40   Kg Single Super Phosphate and 4 Kg decomposing culture/acre for better   decomposition. • Sugarcane trash can also be incorporated while making organic manure   along with press mud and use of earthworms for preparing vermicompost. • Crops like sun hemp and dhaincha are grown as green manure crop. Green   manure crops can be grown as a sole crop and buried in the field at an age of   1.5 to 2 months (before flowering).


Weeds
Cultural control: • Deep ploughing in summer and left undisturbed 20-25 days. • Cross ploughing of land followed by clod crushing and 1-2   harrowing. • At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique ie. pre sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in   field.



Sowing*



Nutrients
• Use biofertilizers such as   Acetobactor, Azotobactor, Azospirillium, Bacillus or Pseudomonas. Either of   these biofertilizers or in combination should be used at the time of sowing @   5 Kg / acre for sett treatment or in soil along with FYM. • Basal application of NPK is done on soil test basis. •  In sugarcane, fertilizer should be   applied as per the table mentioned below. • Apply zinc sulphate @10 Kg/acre in soil at the time of planting. • In soils deficient with micro nutrients like iron, zinc, manganese,   copper, molybdenum and boron, 10 Kg ferrous sulphate, 8 Kg zinc sulphate, 4   Kg manganese sulphate, 4 Kg copper sulphate,1 Kg, sodium molybdate and 2 Kg   borax per hectare should be applied. • Micro nutrient fertilizers should be mixed with well decomposed dung   manure or compost and applied as basal dose.


Weeds
Cultural control: • Adopt proper crop rotation and intercropping. • Avoid mono cropping. • Follow recommended agronomic practices. • If intercropping has been adopted no chemical herbicide should be use in   the field. Chemical control: • 2, 4-D dimethyl amine salt 58% SL @2.52 l in 200 l of water/acre • 2, 4-D sodium salt technical (having 2, 4-D acid 80 % w/w) (earlier   registered as 80%WP) @1-1.3 Kg in 240-360 l of water/acre • Hexazinone 13.2% + diuron 46.8 % WP @800 g in 200 l of water/acre • 2, 4-D ethyl ester 38 % EC (having 2,4-D acid 34 % w/w) @1.412-2.116 l in   200 l of water/acre • Diuron 80% WP @ 0.8-1.6 Kg in 2.4 l of water/acre Note: Herbicide should be selected as per the weed species in previous   season in the same field as per recommendation of CIBRC.


Soil   &amp; seed borne diseases, insect pests
Cultural control: • Select tolerant / resistant varieties • Select the seed cane from aerated steam treated nurseries • Crop like potato, mustard, lentil, pulses and winter vegetables can be   grown as inter crop during autumn planted sugarcane i.e. Oct-Nov &amp;, sunflower, soybean, green gram, groundnut etc. during Feb-March planted sugarcane   to reduce the pests population and to conserve bioagents of white woolly   aphid and other pests • Adopt paired row method of planting


Nematodes
Cultural control: • Deep ploughing, solarisation, flooding, crop rotation and apply organic   manure. • Under wetland conditions, intercropping with sun hemp or marigold or   daincha • Apply pressmud at 6 t/acre or poultry manure @ 0.8 t/acre or neem cake   0.8 t/acre or poultry manure @ 0.4 t/acre before last ploughing. Biological control: • Application of biocontrol agents like Pochonia chlamydosporia,   Paecilomyces lilacinus or Trichoderma viride or Pseudomonas fl uorescens @ 4   Kg/acre at the time of planting mixed with moist FYM or cured pressmud and   distributed uniformly helps in suppressing the plant parasitic nematodes.


Termites &amp; white grubs**
Cultural control: • Remove stubble and debris of previous crops • Dig the termatoria and destroy the queen. Physical control: • Locate and destroy the termite colony and affected setts. • Set up light trap for trapping of white grubs adults and kill them in   kerosene oil water. • At onset of monsoon collect and destroy the adult beetles by shaking the   branches of trees on which they settle during night. Biological control: • Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) can be sprayed at the rate of 100   million nematodes per acre, in root grub and termite infested sugarcane fields OR • EPN infected cadavers of Galleria/Corcyra larvae containing live   infective juveniles (IJs) are implanted   in soil at plant bases at the rate of four cadavers per plant during May/   June and/or September for sugarcane root grub control. Chemical control: For termite: • Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 200-250 ml in 400 l of water/acre or   clothianidin 50%WDG @100 g in 400 l of water/acre or imidacloprid 70% WS   @28-42 g in 40-60 l of water/acre or imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 140 ml in 750 l   of water/acre or chlorpyrifos 20% EC @ 2.5 l/acre For white grubs: • Fipronil 40% + imidacloprid 40% WG@175-200 g in 400-500 l of water/acre   or phorate 10% CG @ 10,000 g/acre


*Apply   Trichoderma spp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens for setts and soil application   (for usage of commercial products check label claim. However, biopesticides   produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not   required).

Chemical control: • Same as sowing stage except diuron 80% WP or metsulfuron methyl 20% WP@   12 g in 200-240 l of water/acre Note: Herbicide should be selected as per the weed species in the field as   per recommendation of CIBRC
