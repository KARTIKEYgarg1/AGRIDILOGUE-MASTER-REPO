Tobacco: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-Sowing*



Nutrients
• Apply 3.2 to 4 t/acre FYM or 2   t/acre vermicompost or 2.4 t/acre press mud and incorporate in the soil at   the time of last preparatory cultivation. • Use leguminous green manure crops like pigeon pea, black gram, cowpea,   cluster bean, French bean etc.


Weeds
• Deep ploughing during summer   and leave the field for 25-30 days. • At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to   minimize the weeds menace in field. • Soil solarization with transparent polyethylene sheet may be adopted. • Rotation of tobacco crop with pulses should be practiced in for better   control of broomrape (Orobanche spp.). • Raising ‘tray nursery’ is effective for growing weed free seedlings.


Insect   pests and soil borne pathogens
Cultural control: • Collect and destroy the plant debris. • Deep plough the field to expose the soil borne pathogens and hibernating   stage of defoliators and subterranean pests.



Nursery*



Nutrients
• Top dressing 35 : 0: 26.8 N:P:   K Kg/acre in 6-8 splits


Damping   off, frog eye leaf spot, leaf blight, anthracnose, black shank

Transplanting



Nutrients
• Apply basal dose of NPK at the   time of sowing @ 12 Kg N, 16 Kg P2O5 and 24 Kg K2O   per acre in main field at the time of transplanting.


Weeds
• Hardened &amp; healthy   seedlings, obtained from pure seeds are desirable for better quality tobacco production and suppression of weed growth. Line   sowing with recommended row spacing. • Timely planting should be done to obtain the healthy tobacco plants.


Damping off
Cultural control: • Optimum seed rate 1.4 Kg/acre to avoid over-crowding. • Raising of seed bed upto10–12 cm height. Biological control: • Same as pre-sowing stage. Chemical control: • Metalaxyl 8% + mancozeb 64% WP @ 2 Kg in 2000 l of water/acre. • Captan 75% WS@ 20-30 g/Kg seeds.

Cultural control: • Rogucing of the affected seedling/ plants before first inter-culture   operation. • Removal of weeds (Solanum nigrum) and plant (Brinjal, Tomato,   Chillies) susceptible to the virus. • Workers should disinfect their hands with soap and running water   before handling seedlings, weeding or doing other cultural operations. Use of   tobacco (smoke, snuff, or chewing) should be prohibited strictly while   working in seedbeds or field. • Growing of resistant varieties. • Spray leaf extracts of Basella alba, Bougainvillea (one litre of extract   dissolved in 100-150 litre of water) on 30th, 40th and 50th days after   transplanting. • Use yellow sticky traps for the management of aphid vector.


Tobacco   leaf curl, tobacco ring spot, mosaic disease
Cultural control: • Deep summer ploughing for management of nematode vector Xiphinema americanum for ring spot virus. • Remove and destroy the diseased tobacco seedlings before and after   planting whenever they are seen in the field. Fill the gaps with healthy   seedlings if it is not too late. • Alternate weed hosts for whitefly should be removed and destroyed. • In endemic areas Sesbania sp. may be grown as a barrier crop around   tobacco fields. • Install 4-5 yellow sticky traps to manage the white fly and aphid as pest   and as a vector for the management leaf curl virus and cucumber mosaic virus   respectively. • Install 4-5 blue sticky traps to manage the thrips as vector. Chemical control: For control of vector. • Oxydemeton–methyl 25% EC@ 400 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre.


Note: The pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on   high volume sprayer. *Apply Trichoderma spp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens as   seeds/seedlings/planting materials, nursery treatment and soil application   (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However,   biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields,   registration is not required). ** Pests of regional significance
