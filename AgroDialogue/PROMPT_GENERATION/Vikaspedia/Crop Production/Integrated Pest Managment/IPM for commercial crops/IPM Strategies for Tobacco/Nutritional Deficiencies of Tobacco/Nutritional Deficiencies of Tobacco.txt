Nutritional Deficiencies of Tobacco


Nitrogen

Leaves become yellowish (chlorotic) starting from lower leaves and move upward as the deficiency increases. N deficient plants are stunted leaves are smaller and more upright than normal plants.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of Urea 1% or DAP 2% twice at weekly intervals.
Phosphorus

Slow and stunted growth, maturity delayed Leaf colour becomes dark green. Mid-day wilting and brown spots on leaves may be observed under mild P deficiency.

Correction Measure: Soil application of recommended dose of phosphorous should be applied at the time of sowing or planting. Foliar spray of DAP 2% twice at fortnightly intervals.
Potassium

Since potassium is very mobile within the plant, symptoms appear first on lower leaves. Older leaves become yellow and necrotic. Mottled or scorched appearance develops at the tips and along the margins of leaves. The plants are less stunted as compared to P & N deficiency.

Correction Measure: Foliar application of K2SO4 @1% twice at weekly interval.
Calcium

Calcium deficiency in tobacco occurs in sandy soil with low pH conditions. As the Ca is immobile in plant, the symptoms first appear on the youngest leaves or buds. Younger leaves develop pale green colour followed by rolling and downward curling. Under extreme deficiency, terminal bud dies while lower leaves develop darker colour.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of CaSO4 @1% twice at fortnightly interval.
