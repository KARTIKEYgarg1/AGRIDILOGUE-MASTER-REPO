Nutritional Deficiencies of Grapes


Nitrogen

Deficiency symptoms

Overall reduction in growth.
Leaves become uniformly light-green or yellow. Reddening of petiole
Berries may be small

Management

Soil application of urea @ 20-60 Kg/acre
Foliar spray of urea (0.3 – 0.5%) 1- 4 times along the growing season , depending on the deficiency severity.

Potassium

Deficiency symptoms

Starts as yellowing (white varieties) or bronze-reddening (red varieties) of olderleaf margins.
As the deficiency worsens, leaf margins become necrotic and curl upwards and inter-vein alchlorosis develops.
Berry set can be poor.

Management

Soil application of 200- 320 Kg K2O/acre for 2-3 years
Foliar sprays of sulphate of potash (0.4 -1%), 3-4 times every 15 d before and after flowering.
Other commercial fertilizers containing K can be used

Magnesium

Deficiency symptoms

Bright yellow (white varieties) or red (red varieties) wedge-shaped areas extend inwards between the veins on older leaves.
When severe, necrosis extends inwards from the leaf margins.
Fruit cluster stem necrosis and berry withering

Management

Soil application of 20-40 Kg MgO/acre
Foliar application of Magnesium sulphte (2%if MgO =32% or if MgO = 16%) or magnesium chloride /nitrate (1-1.5%) 3-6 times every week, beginning from fruit set
Sprays against stem necrosis by magnesium sulphate (as above).

Phosphorus

Deficiency symptoms

Vines may have stunted shoots and fruitfulness is likely to be poor.
Appearance of red dots on basal leaves, especially on the mid or terminal lobes and at first distant from secondary veins.
The red dots, at first randomly distributed, later line up at right angles to the secondary veins and form dark red bars, which coalesce into islands between green veins.

Management

Apply ammonium mono phosphate as an N source (11-52-0).

Sulphur

Deficiency symptoms

Reddening of young leaves. Red dots near the edges of adults leaves. Red dots may coalesce later into red bars at right angles to the vein leaves can drop
Reduced growth lignification is impaired
Small and loose cluster, due to reduced fruit set

Management

Soil application of 20-40 Kg/acre P2O5

Boron

Deficiency symptoms

Shoot tip death and short internodes, resulting in shoots with a zigzag appearance.
Yellowing or reddening dots rolling down, corrugation and odd shapes in young leaves
Fruit set is often poor and bunches often have „hen and chicken‟ berries
Browning of hypodermal cells and breaking of berry

Management

Soil application of borax(Sodium tetraborate) 12-32 Kg/acre
Foliar application of solubor(20.5%B),0.25% 3 times every 15 days ,beginning from 5th -6th leaf development stage.

Iron

Deficiency symptoms

Young leaves show interveinalchlorosis.
When severe, leaves are likely to be very pale with necrotic blotches. Shoots are likely to be stunted in their growth.
Loose cluster shot berries

Management

Soil application of Fe-EDTA or foliar application of Ferrous Sulphate (250g/100 litre water) + citric acid (50g) + liquid detergent

Manganese

Deficiency symptoms

Stunted growth
Interveinal chlorosis or reddening of adults leaves. mosaic like arrangement of yellow /red spots, bordered by the smallest green veins
Delay of berry ripening

Management

Foliar sprays of manganese sulphate (0.2 -0.5%) , 3 times, one before and two after flowering
Foliar sprays of Manganese chelates.

Zinc

Deficiency symptoms

Short internodes, resulting in shoots with a zigzag appearance
Shoot tips have small upward curling of leaves.
Mottled, light coloured interveinal colouring on leaves. Small, poorly developed bunches with hen and chicken berries.

Management

Soil application borax (sodium tertaborate) 12-16 Kg/acre
Foliar sprays of zinc sulphate (0.5 -1.0%) neutralized with calcium carbonate,3 weeks before flowering
