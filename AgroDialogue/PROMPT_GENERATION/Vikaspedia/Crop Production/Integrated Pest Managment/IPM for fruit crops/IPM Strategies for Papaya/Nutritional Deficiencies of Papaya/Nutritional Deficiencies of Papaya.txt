Nutritional Deficiencies of Papaya


Nitrogen

Nitrogen deficiency causes slow growth and older leaves become paler with reduced leaf area and rate of leaf production. Leaf petioles short, thin and compressed

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of urea @2%.

Phosphorus

The deficiency of P causes complete cessation of elongation, older leaves becoming increasingly irregularly necrotic, leaf production is reduced, and marginal choruses and premature death are caused. P deficiency causes a blue or dark green coloration of leaves.

Correction Measure: Soil application of phosphatic fertilizer as per the recommendation.

Potassium

Deficiency of potassium causes marked reduction in growth, leaves profusely smaller, leaf margins necrosis and premature yellowing of plant. Purplish brown patches appear at the base of the petioles. Fruits are badly shaped, poorly filled and unsuitable for marketing.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of KCl @2%

Magnesium

Symptoms show green banding around the margin and next to the midrib. Leaves turn yellowish brown margin. Plant height reduced marginal yellowing of leaf margin extends towards the midrib. Purplish mottling of leaf petiole and malformation of leaves.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of MgSO4 @ 1-2%.

Sulphur

Deficiency causes chlorosis and delaying of green colour in newly emerging leaves, reduced plant growth and reduced leaf size. The leaf blades become very soft and tear easily.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of MgSO4@1%.

Boron

Distortion of newer leaves and the growing point dies. Leaves show chlorotic symptom with inward cupping with stunted growth. Bushy appearance of shoot.

Correction Measure: Soil application of borax @ 2-3 g/plant.

Manganese

Marginal chlorosis of young leaves, which later turn brown. Fruits with raised spots which are dark brown or black in colour. Leaves give striped appearance from the edges.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of MnSO4 @1-2%.
