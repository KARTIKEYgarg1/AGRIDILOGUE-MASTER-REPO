Fig Crop Stage-Wise IPM






Management
 
Activity




Pre-sowing/Pre-planting




 


Common cultural practices:

Timely planting should be done. 
Orchard sanitation 
Destroy the alternate host plants 
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test   recommendations





Nutrients



Nutrient should be applied on the basis of   soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
Adopt integrated nutrient management approach   for supply of nutrients.
Prepare land by ploughing and harrowing. 
Fig is planted in square system of planting at   a spacing of 5 m x 5 m accommodating about 160 plants per acre. Pits of 0.6   cubic m are dug for planting the cuttings. 
Fill the pits with top soil mixed with 25 kg   FYM treated with Trichoderma.





Weeds



Deep ploughing during summer Ploughing the   field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the field.





Nematodes


Cultural control:

Use certified resistant planting   materials 
Clean planting materials by sieving or by   using 2% salt water floatation to remove galls and prevent ear cockle   diseases. 
Galls can be separated by coarse sieve from   the healthy planting materials
Winnowing or fanning 
Brine flotation: 2% salt solution in place of   plain water removes almost 100 % galls.
Deep ploughing of orchards during summer to   control nematodes, 
Soil solarization for control of soil borne   pathogens and nematodes. 
Apply well rotten farm yard manure only to   discourage termite infestation. 
Avoid late plantation





Planting




 


Common cultural practices:

Use healthy and certified plants 
Grow resistant/tolerant varieties. 
Irrigation should be done by ring method to   reduce possibility of diseases 
Avoid growing in low-lying areas and flooding. 
Do not delay irrigation until the tree   exhibits moisture stress symptoms.

Common mechanical practices:

Remove and destroy the diseased orchard.





Nutrients



Planting is done in pits already filled with   top soil and farm yard manure. The planting is generally done during June to   September. 
Apply 20 g each of Azospirillum and   Mycorrhizae per plant in pits at planting





Weeds



Use weed free planting materials for planting. 
Remove weeds from the pit, if any and then   plant seedlings.





Vegetative stage




 


Common cultural practices:

Intercultural and hand weeding 
Timely irrigation 
Avoid water logging 
Avoid water stress

Manures and fertilizers should be applied in   20-30 cm deep and 30cms wide trench along the drip line of the tree.





Weeds



Hoeing is recommended during the first year to   check weed growth. Weeding should be done on regular basis especially around   the plants.
Earthing up is done before or after the onset   of monsoon to avoid water-logging and also to help the plants to stand erect. 
To suppress the weeds between rows, leguminous   trees and vegetables can be grown as intercrops during initial 5 years. 
Use straw or plastic Mulch to avoid weed   growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period





Stem borer


Cultural control:

Remove and destroy dead and severely affected   branches of tree. 
Remove alternative host like mango, moringa,   silk cotton in the near vicinity. 
Avoid injury at the base of trunk while   pruning 
Keep the orchard healthy following good   agricultural practices. 
Kill the stem borer larvae by inserting a   flexible wire inside the hole and plug the hole with the cotton wick soaked   in petrol or chloroform or kerosene and seal it with mud. 

Mechanical control:

Prune and burn all attacked shoot and branches   during winter. 

Biological control:

Exclude alternatives host trees, such as silk   cotton, fig tree and remove the infested branches from the garden to prevent   the spread of the pest. 
Use neem based biopesticide inside the hole. 
Lantana camera leaf extracts @5%





Fruit fly


Cultural control:

Tree rotation, enhancement of soil quality,   choice of resistant varieties, water management, monitoring/screening,   orchard sanitation, mechanical barriers, post-harvest treatment. 
Prior to harvest (30-40 days) collect and disposed   off infested and fallen fruits to prevent further, multiplication and   carry-over of population. 
Ploughing of orchard during November-December   to expose pupae to sun’s heat which kills them. 
Infestation is high, use bait splash on the   trunk only once or twice at weekly interval. To prepare bait splash, mix 100   gm of jaggery in one litre of water 
Managing fruit flies also reduces anthracnose   disease and prevents late fruit fall. 

Mechanical control:

Collect and destroy the adult flies 

Biological control:

Rove beetles, weaver ants, spiders and birds   and bats, 
Release of parasitoids such as Opius   longicaudatus, O. vandenboschi, O. oophilus and Bracon spp





Fig midge


Cultural control:

Removal of Johnson grassy weed 

Biological control:

Neem seed kernel extract 5% 
Parasitoids: Aprostocetus sp.





Mealy bug


Cultural control:

Prune affected shoots during winter. 
Destroy ant colonies. 
Grow attractant plants Bachelor's Buttons or   cornflower (Centaure acyanus), coriander attract wasps. 

Mechanical control:

Collect and destroy the damaged leaves, twigs   and stems 
Use sticky barrier (5cm length) on trunk 

Biological control:

Coccinellids like R. fumida, chrysopid like   Chrysoperla zastrowii silemi and drosophilid like Cacoxenus perspicax





Scale

Leaf roller


Cultural control:

Deep ploughing and soil solaraisation before   planting. 
Collect and burn all infested leaves. 

Biological control:

Conserve parasites such as Apanteles angeleti,   Trathala flavoorbitalis and Cadurcia vanderwulpi 
Conserve predators such as lacewings, assassin   bugs, and minute pirate bugs.





Thrips


Cultural control:

Monitor the tree regularly. 
Adult thrips can be monitored by mass trapping   with coloured (blue, yellow or white) sticky traps or water traps in the   nursery or orchard. 
Ploughing and harrowing, and solarisation can   kill pupae in the soil from previously infested trees. 
Inter-cropping with tomatoes may reduce the   populations of thrips 

Biological control:

Various biological control agents, including   minute pirate bugs, Orius spp. (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) and entomopathogenic   nematodes, Thripinema spp. (Tylenchida: Allantonematidae)





Coccid


Cultural control:

Sanitation is also important for reducing the   pest population by disposing of fallen fruit, which may serve as hosts for   the overwintering females. 
Grow attractant plants for natural enemies:   viz., sunflower family, carrot family plants, buckwheat. 
Control ants and dust which can give the scale   a competitive advantage 

Mechanical control:

Pruning of infested branches and twigs 
Collection and destruction of pruned infested   material. 

Biological control:

Olive scale is effectively controlled by two   parasites Aphytis maculicornis and Coccophagoides utilis. 
Parasitoids such as Encarsia perniciosi and   Aphytis diaspidis cause effective parasitization. 
Coccinellid predators such as Chilocorus   infernalis, Chilocorus rubidus, Pharoscymnus flexibilis check the pest   infestation to some extent. 
Spray dormant oil in late winter before   spring. 
Apply mixture of manure compost tea, molasses   and citrus oil. 
Garlic-pepper tea also helps.
