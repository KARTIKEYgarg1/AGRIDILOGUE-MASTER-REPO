Nutritional deficiencies of Guava


Nitrogen

Stunted growth. Pale green to light yellow colour (chlorosis) appearing first on older leaves, usually starting at the tips. Depending on the severity of deficiency, the choruses could result in the death and / or dropping of the older leaves.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of Urea @ 1-2 % at fortnightly intervals.

Phosphorus

Slow, weak and stunted growth with dark to blue-green coloration to appear on older leaves of some plants. Under severe deficiency, purpling in leaves and stems may appear. Delayed maturity and poor seed and fruit development. 

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of DAP 2% at fortnightly interval.

Potassium

Chlorosis along the edges of leaves (leaf margin scorching) occurs first in older leaves. Plants lacking K will have slow and stunted growth. Stems are weak. The size of seeds and fruits and the quantity of their production is reduced.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of K2SO4 @ 2% at fortnightly interval

Calcium

Symptoms first appear on the younger leaves and leaf tips. The growing tips of roots and leaves turn brown and die. Newly emerging leaves may stick together at the margins, which causes tearing as the leaves expand and unfurl. Younger leaves may be cupped and crinkled, with the terminal bud deteriorating.

Correction Measure: Soil application of gypsum @ 100 kg acre.

Magnesium

The deficiency symptom of interveinal chlorosis first appears in older leaves. Leaf tissue between the veins may be yellowish, bronze or reddish, while the leaf veins remain green. In severe cases, symptoms may appear on younger leaves and cause premature leaf drop. Symptoms occur most frequently in acid soils and soils receiving high amounts of K fertilizer or Ca.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of MgSO4 @ 2% at fortnightly interval.

Sulphur

Younger leaves are chlorotic with evenly, lightly colored veins. Growth rate is retarded and maturity is delayed. Plant stems are stiff, thin and woody. Symptoms may be similar to N deficiency and are most often found in sandy soils that are low in organic matter and receive moderate to heavy rainfall.

Correction Measure: Soil application of gypsum @ 100 kg acre.

Boron

Stunted growth, first showing symptoms on the growing point and younger leaves. The leaves tend to be thickened and may curl and become brittle.

Correction Measure: Foliar spray of Borax @ 0.5% at fortnightly interval.
