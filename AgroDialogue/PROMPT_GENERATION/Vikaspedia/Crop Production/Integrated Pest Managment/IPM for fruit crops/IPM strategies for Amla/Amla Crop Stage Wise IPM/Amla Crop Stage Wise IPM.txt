ManagementActivity



Pre-Planting





Common cultural practices:

 Timely planting should be done.
Field sanitation, roguing


 Destroy the alternate host plants


Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations


Sow the ecological engineering plants


Sow the intercrops as per the season.


Sow/plant sorghum/maize/pearl millet in 4 rows all around the crops as a guard/barrier crop.







Nutrients             





Apply 4 tonnes of well decomposed farm yard manure per acre
Apply 90:120:48 of NPK along with elemental sulphur 10 kg and micro nutrients 10 kg per acre. 
15 kg of FYM and 0.5 kg of phosphorus should be applied to each pit before planting.




Weeds


Regular weeding should be done




Resting stages of soil borne pathogens, pests

Cultural control:

Deep summer ploughing of fields to control soil borne pathogens and subsequently reduces their initial population build up.


Soil solarization: Cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil-borne pests including weeds.





Planting






Common cultural practices:

Use resistant/tolerant planting material/seedlings 
Follow proper plant spacing
Use healthy, certified and weed free planting material.




Nutrients


Application of nitrogen 30 g/tree of each year during September – October up to 10 years. 
The young plants should be given 15-20 kg of well rotten FYM and the mature trees should be given 1 kg of Super Phosphate and 1-1.5kg of muriate of potash 
The above fertilizers should be given in two split doses to mature, bearing tree, once during September-October and during April-May. 


 After setting of the fruits the plants needs to be irrigated after fertilizer application.




Weeds


Same as in pre planting stage




Resting stages of soil borne pathogens, pests


Same as in pre planting stage




Note: Apply Trichoderma viride/ harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens as seed/seedling/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required)



Vegetative stage

Common mechanical practices:

Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant parts. 
Collect and destroy eggs and early stage larvae 
Handpick the older larvae during early stages 
Hand pick the gregarious caterpillars and cocoons which are found on stem/branches and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. 
Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre 
Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm 
Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) 
Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as King crow, common mynah etc. 
Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm
Common biological practices:


Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 


 Augmentative release of natural enemies




Nutrient



As indicated during planting stage.





Weeds






Same as indicated during pre planting stage








Bark eating caterpillar

Cultural control:


Keep orchard clean by proper sanitation. 
Detect early infestation by periodically looking out for drying young shoots. 
Collect loose and damaged bark &amp; destroy. 


 Kill larvae by inserting iron spike or wire into hole





Apical twig gall maker

Cultural control:

Adopt training and pruning to discourage overcrowding of branches. 


 Galled shoots should be pruned and destroyed along with the pest after harvest




Aphids

Cultural control: 

Clipping off and destruction of affected leaf and shoot. 
Collect and destroy alternate weed hosts. 
Eract yellow pan traps @ 4-5 trap/acre
Biological control:
Scymnus, Chilomens sexmaculatus, Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi and other coccinellids, Predatory mantids, green lace wings, ladybird beetles and parasitic wasps




Mealy Bug

Cultural control 

Follow clean cultivation and maintenance of health and vigour of the tree. 


Prune affected parts and destroy them at early stages of infestation. 
Early detection of mealy bugs - presence of ants - indicator 
Cutting of infested twigs and leaves and burying them

 Biological control: 

Field release of green lace wing Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi 
Several species of ladybird beetles such as Chilocorus sp.  and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri are efficient predator.




Pomegranate butterfly

Cultural control:

Clean cultivation and maintenance of health and vigour of the tree should be followed.

Leaf miner



Cultural control:



Avoid pruning live branches more than once a year, so that the cycles of flushing are uniform and short. 
Do not apply nitrogen fertilizer at the times of the year when leaf miner populations are high and flush growth will be severely damaged.. 


Set up yellow pan water trap/sticky traps 15 cm above the canopy for monitoring and management of leaf minor @ 8-10 traps/acre.

Release natural enemies wasp like Pnigalio spp and Closterocerus spp.
