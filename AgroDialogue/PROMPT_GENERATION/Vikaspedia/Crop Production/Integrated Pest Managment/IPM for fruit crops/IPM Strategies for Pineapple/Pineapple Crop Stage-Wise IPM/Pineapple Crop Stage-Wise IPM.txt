Pineapple Crop Stage-Wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-planting*




Common cultural practices: • Destroy the alternate host plants • Sow the ecological engineering plants • Sow sorghum/maize/pearl millet in 4 rows all around the main crop as a   guard/barrier crop • Plough the field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the   field. • Plough deep after harvest to bury the pupae.


Nutrient
• The field should be prepared   very thoroughly by digging and ploughing up to a depth of 40-50 cm to obtain   fine tilth. • Nutrient should be supplied on the basis of soil test report and   recommendation. • Apply 8-10 tonnes of FYM or compost and 50 Kg phosphorus/acre at the time   of last ploughing. • After leveling, the land is laid out into trenches alternating with   mounds for planting the suckers. For double row system of planting, two   shallow furrows about 10-15 cm depth are to be opened.


Weed
• Remove existing weeds/rhizomes   from the field at the time of planting.



Planting*




Common cultural practices: • Collect and destroy plant parts infested with insect pest and   diseases • Use weed free, healthy suckers for planting. • Remove and destroy crop residues. • Avoid planting during wet weather condition • Take up planting in shade free area


Nutrient
• Planting is done double rows   system with a plant to plant spacing of 45 cm and row to spacing of 60 cm.   The double rows are spaced at 1.5 to 2.0m. • If FYM is not applied at the time of field preparation, apply FYM or   compost @ 2 Kg per sucker at the time of planting. • Add mycorrhiza inoculants @ 5 g per plant pits/ trenches at the time of   planting.


Weed
• Remove weeds form the   pit/trenches, if any before planting.


Rodent
Mechanical control: • Use traps to reduce rodent population by using locally available   attractive baits


Nematode
Cultural control: • Maintain weed free and host free fallow period of at least for 6 month   for significant decline in nematode population • Thorough land preparation will reduce nematode population (it will allow   the soil to dry out and accelerates the break down of plant material   harbouring nematodes)


Pest
• Follow common cultural   practices


*  Apply Trichoderma viride/harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens as   seed/seedling/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if   commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides   produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not   required).



Vegetative stage




Common cultural practices: • Collect and destroy crop debris • Collect and destroy disease infected and insect damaged plant parts • Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval   parasitoids are observed • Remove weed plants Common mechanical practices: • Handpick the older larvae during early stages • Collect and destroy plant parts infested with insect pest and diseases • Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on   stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. • Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such   as King crow, common mynah etc. • Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies


Nutrient
• After plants have been   established, apply 16 g nitrogen, 2 g phosphorus and 3 g potash/plant, two to   three times. • Apart from application of 8-10 tonnes of FYM, apply 140 kg nitrogen and   16 kg potash/ acre in three split doses at 2, 5 and 8 months after planting.


Weed
• After planting, whenever weeds   appear interculture should be done without digging of the soil deep. • Weeding is done at least three to four times in a year. • Mulching with dry grasses, straw, sawdust, coirdust, rice husk, plastic   mulch, etc. will also help to suppress weed growth, conserve moisture and   maintain the humus status of soil. • Grow inter crop/ cover crop in between the rows, to suppress the weed   growth in spaces between the rows.


Mealybug
Cultural control: • Avoid using 5-6 years old suckers for planting • Mealybug spread can be minimized by destroying ant colonies. • The mealybug infested fields must be prepared by removing all the plant   residues and incinerating them. • Remove weeds present in the field as they support a hike in mealybug   population by giving them alternate food resources. • Remove alternate hosts such as Hibiscus, custard apple, guava in and   around crop field. • Use sterilized equipment when taking up planting and intercultural   operations in an uninfested field. Biological control: • Application of Beauveria bassiana/Verticillium lecanii @ 5 ml/g (2x 108   cfu/ml or g)/ l of water is effective during high humid months • Release eggs or first instar larvae of Chrysoperla spp. @ 2-3   grubs/plant. • Follow biological practices


Scale
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices


Thrips
Cultural control: • Mulching reduces thrips infestation considerably • Intercrop with plants that have a natural repellence to thrips such as   citronella, garlic and pyrethrum. • Establish windbreaks as they reduce thrips population Biological control: • A spray made of garlic and pepper will control thrips. • Two bulbs of garlic and some hot chilli peppers should be blended in some   water. After blending the solid parts should be filtered. Add water up to 5   litres and this solution can be applied. • Mix 2 kg of fresh plant material of Andrographis paniculata with 250 ml   of water and grind it well. Add 21 litres of cow urine and 10 g of crushed   dried chilli fruits. Add 10 litres of water and leave the solution for some   time. Filter the solution and it is ready for spraying. • Wash fresh roots of Derris eliptica and cut them into short pieces of 5   cm length. Add small amount of water and pound the roots until they are   finely shredded. Filter the solution. Dilute with soap and water at a ratio   of 1 part soap: 4 parts root solution: 225 parts water. Apply   immediately. • Follow common biological practices


Phytophthora   heart (top) rot
Cultural control: • Avoid excessively deep planting • Prevent soil entering the heart during planting • Maintain proper drainage for minimizing the risk of Phytophthora   infection. • Planting on raised beds of at least 20 cm height • Constructing drains to intercept run-off before it reaches   plantation • Constructing drains within field so that water can be removed quickly   without causing erosion • Installing underground drains. • Liming materials which increase pH should be used cautiously as P.   cinnamomi become active at pH above 4 in the soil • In high nutrient soils, P. nicotianae, becomes active so apply   fertilizers optimally.


Phytophthora root rot
Cultural control: • Same as in Phytopthora heart rot.


Base (butt) rot
Cultural control: • Do not leave a portion of fruit attached to the crown when picking • Improve soil drainage



Reproductive (fruit)   stage




Common cultural practices: • Remove weeds around the plants. • Collect and destroy the plant debris and diseased plants. • Maintain proper drainage Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies


Nutrients
• Apply recommended   micronutrients, if deficiency symptoms are observed.


Weeds
• Use straw or plastic/ straw   mulch to avoid weed growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period.


Pineapple fruit borer
• Follow common biological   practices


Pineapple fruit fly
Cultural control: • Plucking off of infested fruits and fermented fruits and destroying them   or expose them to sun to kill developing larvae. • Bagging or netting of fruits.


White grubs/root grubs
Cultural control: • The cultural control of late-spring and early-fall ploughing or disking   provide control. • Crop rotation is the most effective method. Biological control • Follow common biological practices


Pineapple weevil
Cultural control: • After two plant cycles replant with new suckers • Use fresh disease free suckers for planting • Collect and burn the crop waste in and around the field • Follow crop rotation with non-host crops • Restrict the movement of infected plant parts to other areas Biological control • Follow common biological practices


Pineapple red mite
Cultural control: • The best management action is to plant only mite-free seed-plant   material. • Population densities of mites can be reduced by lower or minimal   fertilizer applications.


Termites
Cultural control: • Select low termite risk areas for planting • Use termite resistant varieties suitable for that region • Reduce mechanical damage to the plants • Removal of termite nests • Increasing biodiversity by interplanting reduces termite damage • Clear the area of the material that could attract termites before   planting • Completely remove and burn the tree stumps


Pest   management options for pineapple pests
• Cow urine: Dilute one litre of   cow urine in ten litres of water and wet the whole plant at the rate of   80-120 l/acre at regular intervals. • Cow dung: 12.5 kg of fresh cow dung and 12.5 litres of cow urine are   collected in an earthen pot and mixed thoroughly with 12.5 litres of water.   The pot is covered and the mixture is allowed to ferment for a week.   Occasionally it is stirred with a stick. After a week of fermentation, the   mixture is filtered and 100 g of lime is added. The concentration is diluted   with water in a 1: 10 ratio and sprayed on the crop at 80-100 l/acre. • Neem oil spray: Neem oil spray: 2% neem oil is mixed with any detergent   powder at 40– 50 g/100 l and used as a spray solution. • Herbal mixture spray: About 500 g of tobacco leaves, 1 kg of neem kernel,   500 g lime powder, 500 g datura leaves and 500 g pods and seeds of oleander   (Nerium oleander) are powdered and mixed together, then soaked in 15 litres   of water for 15 days. On alternate days, the mixture needs to be stirred with   a stick. After 15 days, one litre of filtrate is mixed in 15 litres of water   and sprayed on the crop. It is enough for 2.5 ha and is a multi-pest   repellent (Joy, Anjana and Sowmya 2013).


Fruitlet   core rot (green eye), fusariosis, green fruit rot, interfruitlet corking,   leathery pocket
• Follow common cultural   practices


Water blister
Cultural control: • Collect and destroy the plant debris and diseased plants. • Handle fruit carefully to avoid bruising and scuffing (rapid fungal   invasion occurs even minute, weeping fractures) • Reject sun burnt and damaged fruit because these have minor skin cracks   that are readily infected • Remove pineapple refuse and rejected fruit from in and around packing   shed • Maintain proper drainage


Fruit   rot by yeast and candida species
Cultural control: • Collect and destroy the plant debris and diseased plants. • Protect the young developing fruit with paper bags in frost prone   areas • Discard the fruit showing even minor interfruitlet cracking • Any fruit showing fractures between fruitlets should be picked at the   earliest stages of fruit maturity to minimize losses


Mealybug wilt disease
Cultural control: • Use planting materials from wilt free areas or from fields with a low   level of wilt disease • If &lt;3% plants show wilt symptoms then remove the infected plants by   hand and destroy them • If &gt;10% plants show wilt symptoms do not use the field as a source of   planting material • Eradicate badly affected areas immediately after harvest • Keep main fields and field boundaries free of weeds and trash which may   act reservoirs for ants and mealybugs


Yellow spot
Cultural control: • Avoid destroying old weedy patches near young crown planting or fields   with developing fruit (to prevent spread of thrips to fruits)
