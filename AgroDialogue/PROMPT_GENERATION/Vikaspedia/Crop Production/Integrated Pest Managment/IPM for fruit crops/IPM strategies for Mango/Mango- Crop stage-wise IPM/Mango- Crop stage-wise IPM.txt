Mango: Crop stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*




Common cultural practices: •Destroy the alternate host plants •Sow the ecological engineering plants •Sow sorghum/maize/pearl millet in 4 rows all around the main crop as   guard/barrier crop •Plough the field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the   field. •Plough deep after harvest to bury the pupae. •Deep summer ploughing of field reduces the incidence of mealy bug and   soil-borne pathogens. •Seed nuts must be collected during peak period of harvest and sun dried   for two to three days. •Medium size nuts (7-9 gm) may be selected to get vigorously growing   seedlings. •Seed nuts should be soaked over night in water before sowing. •Sow the soaked nuts in the polythene bags filled with potting   mixture. •Seedlings will be ready for grafting 40-50 days after germination. •Irrigate the orchards as and when required •Provide proper shade, irrigation &amp; drainage. •Rogue out diseased seedling. •Employ locally made rat traps. •Use resistant/tolerant varieties •Destroy the alternate host plants

Weeds
• Hand weeding and timely   mulching.



Sowing*




Common mechanical   practices: •Remove new sprouts emerging from root stock at frequent intervals. •Shift the grafts frequently from one place to another to prevent them from   striking roots into the ground.


Pests, Soil-borne pathogens
Cultural Control: •Well decomposed farm yard manure coupled with Trichoderma viride/harzianum   should be used. •Nursery beds should be raised.. •Nursery beds should be fumigated with 4% formalin Mechanical Control: •Destruction of termetorium along with queen. Chemical Control: •Drenching of the planting pits with Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 5 ml/l of water



Vegetative *




Common cultural practices: •Collect and destroy crop debris •Collect and destroy disease infected and insect damaged plant parts •Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval   parasitoids are observed •Remove weed plants •Provide timely irrigation, organic manure, fertilizer as per the   recommended dose, drainage, weeding, mulching, interculture etc. Common mechanical practices: •Handpick the older larvae during early stages •Collect and destroy plant parts infested with insect pest and   diseases •Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on   stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. •Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre •Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm •Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) •Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as   King crow, common mynah etc. •Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: •Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering •Augmentative release of natural enemies

Red rust
•Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: •If vigour of plant is maintained by balanced nutrients, the disease is   less. •As the disease starts on the onset of rain, it is desired to spray   fungicide copper oxy-chloride twice during the month of July/ August at 15   days intervals.


Phoma blight
•Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: •The affected branches should be collected and burnt. •Balanced nutrition provides resistance to phoma blight



Reproductive*



Mango   Leaf Hopper, Leaf webber, Mango mealy bug
•Same as vegetative stage.


Scale insects,
Cultural control: •Prune heavily infested plant parts to open the tree canopy and destroy‟   them immediately. •Prune infested parts (branches and twigs) preferably during summer. •These should be placed in a pit constructed on one corner of the orchard.   Allow branches and twigs to dry until the parasites escape. •Burn the remaining debris. •Removal of attendant ants may permit natural enemies to control the   insect. Chemical control: •Malathion 50% EC @ 900-1200 ml in 600-800 l of water/acre


Inflorescence midge,
Cultural control: •Deep ploughing of orchard in October- November to expose pupae and   diapausing larvaeto sun‟s heat which kills them.


Stone weevil
Cultural control: •Collection and destruction of infested and fallen fruits at weekly   interval till fruit harvest. •Ploughing of orchard after harvest to expose hibernating adults, reduce,   infestation levels. •Destroy all left over seeds in the orchard and also in the processing   industries. Biological Control: •The natural enemies recorded on S. gravis include a mite Rhizoglyphussp.,   ants (Camponatus sp., Monomorium sp. and Oecophyllasmaragdina) andfungus   Aspergillussp., Beauveriabassiana was found to be pathogenic on mango weevil.


Shoot gall psylla,
Cultural control: •Galls with nymphs should be collected and destroyed. Biological control: •Conserve the predators like   blackladybird beetle, purplish pirate bug, brown lacewing, tiny parasitic wasp.


Shoot borer,
Cultural control: •Attacked shoots should be clipped off and destroyed. •Clean hole and pour kerosene/petrol/crude oil or formalin into the stem   borer hole and subsequently close entrance of the tunnel by plugging with   cotton wool and paste the mud. •Use light trap@1/acre Chemical control: •Monocrotophos36%SL@ 600-800 ml in 200-800 l of water/acre


Powdery   mildews, Anthracnose, Dieback, Bacterial canker, Red rust, Phoma blight
•Same as vegetative stage


Sooty mould
•Pruning of affected branches   and their prompt destruction prevents the spread of the disease


Stem end rot
Cultural control: •Avoid harvesting of immature fruits Cool fruits immediately after harvest   and store in well ventilated containers.


Gummosis
Cultural control: •The diseased bark / portion should be removed or cleaned and pasted   withcow dung paste.


Mango malformation
Cultural control: •The floral malformed panicles/ vegetative malformed shoots should be   pruned and burnt which reduces the incidence of malformation. •Application of NAA (200 ppm) in the first week of October (Before bud   differentiation stages) followed by de-blossoming in the late December or   January reduces the incidence of malformation.



Maturation *



Mango Shoot Caterpillar
Cultural control: •Keep orchard clean and healthy. •Removal and destruction of egg masses.


Fruit fly
Cultural control: •Prior to harvest (30-40 days) collect and disposed off infested and fallen   fruits to prevent further multiplication and carry-over of population. •Ploughing of orchard during November-December to expose pupae to sun‟s heat   which kills them. •If infestation is heavy, bait splash on the trunk only, once or twice at   weekly interval is recommended. To prepare bait splash, mix 100 gm of jaggery   in one litre of water and add 1 ml of deltamethrin by using an old broom. •Managing fruit flies also reduces anthracnose disease and prevents late   fruit fall. Mechanical control: •Male annihilation technique: Set up fly trap using methyl eugenol. Prepare   methyl eugenol 1 ml/l of water + 1 ml of malathion solution. •Take 10 ml of this mixture per trap and keep them at 25 different places   in one ha between 6 and 8 am. •Collect and destroy the adult flies. Physical control: •Hot water treatment of fruit at 48 ± 1 ºC for 4-5min. Biological control: •Use methyl eugenal pheromone trap@4/acre


Sooty   mould, anthracnose, bacterial canker
•Same as vegetative stage



Postharvest



Anthracnose   (C. gloeosporioides), Stem end rot (L. theobromae), Aspergillus rot
Physical control: •Hot water treatment at 520C for 4-5min. •Fruits should be sprayed with the mixture of bio-inoculants. Botanical control: •Postharvest dip treatment of fruits with botanical fungicides could also   control the diseases during storage.
