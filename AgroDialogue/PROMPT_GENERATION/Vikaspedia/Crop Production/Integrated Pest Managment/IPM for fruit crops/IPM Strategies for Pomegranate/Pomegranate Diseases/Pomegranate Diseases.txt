The pathogen also infects stem and branches causing girdling and cracking symptoms.
Spots on fruits were dark brown irregular slightly raised with oily appearance, which split open with L-shaped cracks under severe cases.



Survival and spread:


Primary source of inoculum is Infected cuttings
Secondary source of inoculum spreads through Wind splashed rains.

Favourable conditions:


The increase in day temperature (38.6°C) and afternoon relative humidity of 30.4% along with cloudy weather and intermittent rainfall favored the disease initiation and further spread of the disease. 

Leaf and fruit spot

Survival and spread:


Primary spread : Diseased plant debris
Secondary spread : Wind borne conidia

Anthracnose

Disease Symptoms:


Small, regular to irregular black spots on leaves, calyx region and fruits which turn later on as dark brown depressed spots.
Infected leaves turn yellow and drop off.



Survival and spread:


Primary source of inoculum: Infected leaves
Secondary source of inoculum: windborne conidia.

Favourable conditions:


The disease is severe during August-September when there is high humidity, and the temperature  between 20-27ºC.

Fusarium wilt

Disease symptoms:


Affected plants show yellowing of leaves in some twigs or branches, followed by drooping and drying of leaves.
