Citrus: Crop stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre planting*



Nutrients
• Pits of 1 metre cube are dug   in square system during summer season and kept open for controlling soil   borne pests.


Weeds
• Deep ploughing before   establishment of orchards • Remove the weeds mechanically.


Pests, nematode and soil   borne pathogens
• Deep summer ploughing of   fields to control nematodes and soil borne diseases • Use of resistant / tolerant varieties



Planting *



Nutrients
• Pits should be filled with a   mixture of pond silt, red soil and FYM. • Two- three Kg of bone meal or single super phosphate per pit should be   applied.


Weeds
• Inter-cropping • Inter culture operation and hand weeding • Where mechanical removal is not possible apply 2,4-D Sodium salt   Technical (having 2,4-D acid 80 % w/w) (Earlier Registered as 80% WP) 0.5-1.28   Kg in 240 l of water/acre or apply Diuron 80% WP @ 1-2 Kg in 240 l of the   water/acre (only for sweet orange) for control of weeds such as Cyperus iria,   Tribulus terrestris, Digera arvensis, Commelinanudiflora.



Vegetative growth   stage * (1-5 years)



Nutrients
• Nitrogen is applied in the   form of FYM and oil cakes each at 25% and the remaining 50% with chemical   fertilizers, while, P2O5 in the form of super phosphate and K2O in the form   of muriate of potash. • Manures are applied in 2 to 3 equal doses ie. first dose in   December-January, 2nd dose in June-July, 3rd dose in September. Potash   application can be reduced if the soil is rich in this nutrient. • Nitrogen containing fertilizers should be applied in three equal splits   in January, July and November; phosphorus containing fertilizers in two   splits in January and July and potassium containing fertilizers may be   applied as single dose in January. • Adopt ring method of fertilizer application. • A mixture of zinc sulphate 0.5%, manganese sulphate 0.2%, boric acid   0.1%, urea 1% and lime 0.4% has to be sprayed two or three times in a year to   control chlorosis in leaves. • Intercrops during pre-bearing period short growing crops like groundnut,   ragi, bajra wheat and vegetables (except solanaceous crops) can be profitably   grown in the inter spaces. • In the bearing orchards, raise green manure crops like sunhemp, green   gram, cowpea etc and incorporate into the soil during the monsoon   period. 



Vegetative growth   stage (1-5 years)



Weeds
• Timely interculturing and hand   weeding should be done. • Mulching - After weeding and manuring, apply dry-leaf mulch or paddy husk   to a thickness of 8 cm in the basin. • Inter-cultivation - Shallow ploughing or light hand digging should be   done during monsoon season. The soil in the basin is likely to become hard   under continuous irrigation and therefore it should be given a light   hand-digging with spade after every three irrigations so as to maintain   porosity and tilth. Under no circumstances should weeds be allowed to grow   rampant in the orchard.



Fruiting stage (5-20   years)



Weeds
• Cultural operations same as in vegetative stage.

For   sweet orange and mandarin avoid susceptible rootstocks. Chemical control: • For acid lime, use seedling immunised with mild strain of Citrus Tristeza   Virus (Cross protection). • Periodic sprays of insecticides like Monochrotophos 0.05 % controls the   population of citrus aphids that reduces secondary spread of the disease in   the orchard. • Copper oxy chloride 50% WP @ 1 Kg in 300-400 l of water/acre


Gummosis
Cultural control: • Disease spread can be controlled by removing diseased bark and a buffer   strip of healthy, light brown to greenish bark around the margins of the   infection. • Preventive measures like selection of proper site with adequate   drainage. • Use of resistant rootstocks and avoiding contact of water with the tree   trunk by adopting ring method of irrigation are effective. Chemical control: • Aureofungin 46.15% w/v. SP @ 300 (1%) gm /ml/acre.


Powdery mildew**

Greening
Cultural control: • Selection of proper site with adequate drainage and high budding (30 to   46 cm or above). • Provision of an inner ring about 45 cm around the tree trunk to prevent   moist soil. (Double ring method of irrigation) • Avoid irrigation water from coming in direct contact with the tree   trunk. • Avoid injuries to crown roots or base of stem during cultural   operations. • Use resistant sour orange rootstocks for propagating economic   varieties • Use certified pathogen free bud wood for propagation. Chemical control: • Control psyllids with insecticides like dimethoate or imidacloprid • Applying Bordeaux paste or ZnSO4, CuSO4, lime (5:1:4) to a height of   about 60 cm above the ground level at least once a year.



Note: The pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on high volume spray.

* Apply Trichoderma spp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens as seed/seedling/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).
