Cherry: Crop Stage-Wise IPM






Management  
 
Activity 




Pre-planting* 




 


Common cultural practices: 

Timely planting should be done. 
Use resistant and non–infected planting   material 
Proper field selection should be made for   raising the orchards of cherry. 
Avoid planting of saplings infected with   scales, borer and disease 
Make use of balanced dose of chemical   fertilizers and avoid excessive use of nitrogen which should be used in split   doses only. 
Grow the attractant, repellent, and trap crops   around the orchard bunds.
Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum   for the management of aphids and thrips. 
French bean acts as an attractant plant for   predatory thrips.  
Grow ecological engineering plants. 





Nutrients 



Nutrient should be applied on the basis of   soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
Prepare land by ploughing and harrowing.
Pits of 1m x 1m x 1m size are dug at a   distance of 6 m on contour lines or in square system of planting. 
Pits are filled with a mixture of top soil,   35-40 Kg farmyard manure and half Kg super phosphate one month before   planting. 





Weeds 



Deep summer ploughing 





Soil borne fungus, resting stages of insects and weeds 


Cultural control: 

Soil solarization: Cover the beds with   polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing   for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil-borne pests. 

Biological control: 

Apply neem cake @ 100 Kg/acre at the time of   transplanting for reducing borer damage as well as to reduce the soil borne   diseases while preparing the nurseries. 





Planting* 




Nutrients 



Planting is done in December-January in pits   already filled with farm yard manure. 
Add mycorrhiza culture @ 50 g/pit or a basket   of soil taken from old cherry orchard to ensure mycorrhiza association with   seedling roots. 





Weeds



Plough the field before the planting 
Use weed free seedlings for planting. 
Remove weeds from the pits before planting. 





Diseases and insect pests



Select resistant varieties. 





Vegetable stage




 


Common cultural practices:

Collect and destroy diseased and insect   infected plant parts. 
Apply white wash impregnated with glue   regularly on the tree trunks to avoid sun burn and winter injury. 
2-3 bee colonies/ha should be provided on each   orchard at the time of bloom.
Proper irrigation should be adopted. 
Trees should neither be forced to drought nor   water lodging conditions.
Rogue out infected plants
Avoid water lodging at tree base and improve   drainage of the orchards. 
Maintain vigour of the tree to keep away shot   hole/pin hole borers, bark beetles and other pest infestation. 
Keep the trees as free as possible from   mechanical wounds, winter injury, crotch separation and canker. 
Proper pruning of the trees be made for   obtaining quality fruits and good yield. 
Pruning cuts should be made close to the   branches leaving no stubs.
Cut wound should be covered with superior   white lead pants. 
Solarization of nursery beds should be under   taken to destroy soil pests.
Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding   chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed. 

Common mechanical practices:

Collection and destruction of eggs and early   stage larvae 
Handpick the older larvae during early stages   of plant
The infested shoots and seed capsules may be   collected and destroyed 
Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the   cocoons which are found on stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. 
Use yellow sticky traps for aphids and blue   for thrips @ 4-5 trap/acre.
Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6   pm and 10 pm 
Erect bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging   predatory birds such as King crow, common mynah etc. 
Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm 

Common biological practices: 

Conserve natural enemies through ecological   engineering
Augmentative release of natural enemies. 
Ladybird beetle, Adalia sp, Synharmonia sp,   Exochomus sp, Stethorus sp @ 30-50 adults/infested tree.
Lacewing and Syrphus sp. @ 10-20 first instar   larvae/tree





Nutrients 



Since fruit development and vegetative growth   occurs simultaneously, it has high demand for mineral nutrients. 
The amount of manure and fertilizer to be   applied is influenced by the age or size of tree, soil types, fertility,   cultural practices and anticipated fruit yield.
For achieving higher yields of quality   product, generally nutrients should be applied according to the age of plant   using organic and inorganic sources as mentioned below;

Farmyard manure should be applied in December   along with a full dose of super phosphate and muriate of potash. 
Nitrogen is applied in 2 splits, first half at   2-3 weeks before flowering and the remaining half a month later. 
The fertilizers should be applied in 20-30 cm   deep and 30cms wide trench along the drip line of the tree. 





Weeds 



Mulch the tree basin in April with 10 to 15 cm   thick dry grass or hey to reduce weeds and conserve the soil moisture 
Grow green mannuring crops e.g. bean, pea, red   clover or white clover in the tree basins to manage the weed and improve soil   texture and fertility. 
Us slashing and mowing between the rows to   control the weeds.





Root borer**  



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 

Cultural control: 

Avoid growing Malvaceous crops in sequence.

Biological control: 

Spray NSKE 5% 





Shot hole borer/pin head borer 



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 

Cultural control: 

Maintaining trees in a sound and vigorous   condition with sufficient fertilizers, water, and sunburn prevention will   keep uninfested tree limbs from becoming damaged and prevent attack by this   beetle. 
Pruning can be helpful in eliminating areas in   older trees infested with shot hole borer. 
Severely infested trees should be removed. 
Burn or remove all infested wood from the   orchard before the growing season starts. 
Do not leave pruned limbs or stumps (healthy   or infested) near orchards (for example, woodpiles) as beetles can emerge   from these materials before they dry out and then migrate into orchards.

Biological control: 

Spray NSKE 5% 





Aphids**, mealy plum aphid, green peach aphid 



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 





Hairy caterpillar, case bearer caterpillar**

Captan 75% WP @ 0.67 Kg in 6-8 l of water/acre





Bacterial gummosis



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult   nearest KVKs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes.

Cultural control: 

Ensure that a suitable cherry variety and   rootstock is chosen based on geographic location and environmental conditions   to prevent stress to tree which predisposes tree to canker disease





Silver leaf canker



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult   nearest KVKs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes. 

Mechanical control: 

To control the disease, prune at the first   sign of silvering. Make the cut below the diseased area into healthy wood.
Cover pruning wounds that are larger than   1.5cm with pruning sealer. 
Remove and bury or burn all infected branches,   leaves and twigs. This will help to reduce the amount of disease the   following year.





White root rot, Fruit/whisker rot



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices.
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult   nearest KVKs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes. 

Cultural control: 

Establish a dry zone and prevent soil movement   or water runoff from that site. 

Mechanical control: 

Uproot and dispose of infected trees. 
Remove immediately adjacent trees that may   also be infected. 
Remove as many root pieces from soil as   possible and trench around the infected site to break root grafts.





Root rot/collar rot



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult   nearest KVKs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes.

Cultural control:

Cherry trees should be planted in   well-draining soil to minimize the frequency and duration of water saturated   soil 
Trees should be propagated from resistant   rootstock; Rootstocks vary in susceptibility to the different Phytophthora   species; none are resistant to all pathogenic species of the fungus. 
Good soil drainage and more frequent but   shorter irrigations reduce the risk of root and crown rot. 
Avoid locations with a history of Phytophthora   root and crown rot, especially when planting susceptible rootstocks. 
Plant new orchards on berms to improve   drainage at the crown area 27 and design the irrigation system so that the   trunk and crown of the tree is not wet by sprinklers. 
Be sure to verify that Phytophthora is the   causal agent before treating a new planting with fungicides, because a number   of factors or pest problems can cause poor growth and death of trees.





Powdery mildew



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult   nearest KVKs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes. 

Cultural control: 

Keep proper spacing during sowing which   promote good air circulation around tree canopies to lower humidity





Coryneum blight/shot hole



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult   nearest KVKs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes.

Cultural control: 

Diligent sanitation and water management can   provide adequate control where the incidence of shot hole is low.

·   Avoid overhead sprinklers or use a low angle to avoid wetting foliage.
Mechanical control: 

Prune and dispose of infected tissue as soon   as it appears. 
After leaf drop, inspect plants carefully and   prune infected buds and twigs with lesions.





Crown rot/gall



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices.
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult   nearest KVKs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes





Prunus nectrotic ringspot virus



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult   nearest KVKs/SAUs/ICAR Institutes. 

Cultural control: 

Use nursery stock that has been tested and   found to be free of all known viruses. 
If propagating your own trees, use both   virus-indexed bud wood and virus-certified rootstock. 
Infected pollen should not be introduced into   healthy orchards during pollination.
Establish new plantings in blocks, the larger   the better,and preferably at some distance from older orchards.
Rogue infected trees in new virus-indexed   orchards, but it is not economical to rogue or replant mature infected   orchards unless trees are infected with the rugose strain. 
Complete orchard removal should be considered. 
Thermotherapy (24 to 32 days at 38°C) and/or   apical meristem culture have been used to eliminate various viruses.





Reproductive/fruiting stage




Nutrients



Half dose of N is applied in spring before   flowering and the other half dose of N is applied one month later.   Fertilizers are applied in tree basin about 30 cm away from the tree   trunk. 
The band application of nitrogenous   fertilizers should be preferred over broadcasting. 
Apply recommended micronutrients, if   deficiency symptoms are observed.





Weeds



Remove weeds around the plants/tree basin.
Use straw or plastic mulch to avoid weed   growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period. 
Mulching tree basins with 10-15 cm thick dry   grass also checks weed growth.





Borers



Same as in vegetative stage





Diseases



Same as in vegetative stage 

Cultural control: 

Collect and destroy fallen fruits.





Note: The dosages of pesticides are based on high volume sprayer
