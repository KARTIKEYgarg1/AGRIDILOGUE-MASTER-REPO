Tree Pest Management


Insect pests are detrimental to the vigorous growth and health of planting stock which ultimately affect the survival of out planted seedlings in the field. Development of pest management practices is an important priority area in forestry so as to produce healthy seedlings for attaining improved productivity. Timely and proper utilisation of the developed pest management package of practices could keep the pests at an innocuous level and reduce the high cost of containing the pest in outbreak situations and loss of planting material could be avoided.  (in nurseries and plantations) relies mostly on monitoring to detect pest incidences and identify pest population levels. The key tactic is prevention. For this, information on pests and planning to prevent or reduce the pest incidence is required.

Based on the information about the periodicity of incidence, intensity of attack, nature of damage, biology of key pests and the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on pest build up, suitable management measures were standardized for some of the key pests by integrating cultural, mechanical, biological and chemical methods.

The following combinations of  strategies are recommended for employing integrated pest management methods for tree pests in forest nurseries.


  



STRATEGY


METHOD




1 			Initiate implementing pest management strategies well before pest 			incidence. Install light traps. Assessing pest abundance through 			sampling


Regular 			monitoring and early detection of pests with the help of Pest 			Calendar and identifying abundance level to take appropriate 			measures.



2. Weed clearing, disposal of infested seedlings, hand picking or net collection of pests and destruction, pruning of affected areas.
Employing cultural and physical methods to minimize incidence and spread of the pest.


3. Delay pesticide application
Allowing build up of natural enemy population.


4. Applying commercially available bacterial, viral, fungal formulations.
Applying microbial formulations.


5. Prepare extracts with easily and commonly available plants through cost effective methods and apply.
Applying effective plant based extracts to minimize pest incidence and spread.


6. Host plant resistance
Identification and utilization of pest resistant/tolerant candidates.


57. Applying need based safe and less persistent insecticides.
Pesticide application



Pest Calendar which documents various pests and their natural enemies will help in taking various prophylactic measures for management of insect pests.
