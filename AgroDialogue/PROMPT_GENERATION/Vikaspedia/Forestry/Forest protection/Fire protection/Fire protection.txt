Fire protection


Introduction

Forest fire causes imbalances in nature and endangers biodiversity by reducing faunal and floral wealth. Traditional methods of fire prevention are not proving effective and it is now essential to raise public awareness on the matter, particularly among those people who live close to or in forested areas.

Causes of forest fire

Traditionally Indian forests have been affected by fires. The menace has been aggravated with rising human and cattle population and the consequent increase in demand for forest products by individuals and communities. Causes of forest fires can be divided into two broad categories: environmental (which are beyond control) and human related (which are controllable).


Environmental causes are largely related to climatic   conditions such as temperature, wind speed and direction, level of moisture   in soil and atmosphere and duration of dry spells. Other natural causes are   the friction of bamboos swaying due to high wind velocity and rolling stones   that result in sparks setting off fires in highly inflammable leaf litter on   the forest floor.
Human related causes result from human activity as well as methods of   forest management.Â  These can be intentional or unintentional, for   example

graziers and gatherers of various forest products   starting small fires to obtain good grazing grass as well as to facilitate   gathering of minor forest produce like flowers of Madhuca indica and   leaves of Diospyros melanoxylon
the centuries old practice of shifting cultivation   (especially in the North-Eastern region of India and inparts of the States of   Orissa and ).
the use of fires by villagers to ward off wild   animals
fires lit intentionally by people living around   forests for recreation
fires started accidentally by careless visitors to   forests who discard cigarette butts.


The causes   of forest fire have been increasing rapidly. The problem has been accentuated   by the growing human and cattle population. People enter forests ever more   frequently to graze cattle, collect fuelwood, timber and other minor forest   produce. It has been estimated that 90% of forest fires in India are   man-made.

Effect of forest fire

Fires are a major cause of forest degradation and have wide ranging adverse ecological, economic and social impacts, including:


Loss of valuable timber resources,
Degradation of catchment areas,
Loss of biodiversity and extinction of plants and        animals,
Loss of wildlife habitat and depletion of        wildlife,
Loss of natural regeneration and reduction in        forest cover,
Global warming,
Loss of carbon sink resource and increase in        percentage of CO2 in atmosphere,
Change in the microclimate of the area with        unhealthy living conditions,
Soil erosion affecting productivity of soils and        production,
Ozone layer depletion,
Health problems leading to diseases,
Loss of livelihood for tribal people and 
The rural poor, as approximately 300 million        people are directly dependent upon collection of non-timber forest        products from forest areas for their livelihood.

Need for forest fire management

The incidence of forest fires in the country is on the increase and more area is burned each year. The major cause of this failure is the piecemeal approach to the problem. Both the national focus and the technical resources required for sustaining a systematic forest fire management programme are lacking in the country. Important forest fire management elements like strategic fire centres, coordination among Ministries, funding, human resource development, fire research, fire management, and extension programmes are missing.

Taking into consideration the serious nature of the problem, it is necessary to make some major improvements in the forest fire management strategy for the country. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, has prepared a National Master Plan for Forest Fire Control. This plan proposes to introduce a well-coordinated and integrated fire-management programme that includes the following components:


Prevention of human-caused fires through   education and environmental modification. It will include silvicultural   activities, engineering works, people participation, and education and   enforcement. It is proposed that more emphasis be given to people participation   through Joint Forest Fire Management for fire prevention. 
Prompt detection of fires through a well   coordinated network of observation points, efficient ground patrolling, and   communication networks. Remote sensing technology is to be given due importance   in fire detection. For successful fire management and administration, a   National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) and Fire Forecasting System are to   be developed in the country.
Fast initial attack measures.
Vigorous follow up action.
Introducing a forest fuel modification system at   strategic points.
Fire fighting resources. 

Each of the above components plays an important role in the success of the entire system of fire management. Special emphasis is to be given to research, training, and development.
