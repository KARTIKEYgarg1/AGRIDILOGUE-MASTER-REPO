Forest Nursery


Introduction

Forestry as a   sector plays a vital role in the socio-economic and rural development of a country   apart from its role in maintaining ecological stability particularly in a   developing country like India. Forests are a traditional source of a   multitude of products particularly with regard to fuelwood, fodder, small and   constructional timber and have sustained large masses of population. The vast   potential of forests to generate employment especially in rural areas,   thereby contributing to rural incomes and poverty alleviation has remained   unutilized.

The country's   forests are under tremendous pressure due to the indiscriminate removal of   timber, fuelwood, fodder and other forest produce.

Though there   are various afforestation and plantation programmes being implemented by the   State Forest Departments, Forest based industries, NGOs, etc., availability   of quality planting material well in time and in close proximity to areas   where afforestation is to be taken up remains a major constraint in taking up   large scale afforestation of wastelands, private lands, etc.

Need for raising nurseries for large scale afforestation

The National Forest Policy stipulates that   one third geographic area of the country should be brought under forest/tree cover. It calls for increasing substantially the forest/tree cover in the country through massive afforestation and social forestry programmes, especially on all denuded, degraded and unproductive lands. It also emphasises on active participation of the communities is necessary for the success   of any forest regeneration programme. Hence the need for nurseries to supply the required quality planting material is a important.

One of the way of fulfilling the requirement is promotion of decentralised nurseries   through credit in the rural areas. This leads to easy and timely availability   of planting material and in the process lead to creation of employment   opportunities and income generation in the rural areas. These Forest nurseries will also be one of the means for active participation of the communities in future   forest regeneration programmes.

The issues that are to be addressed include devising an incentive mechanism that would motivate village   communities  to participate on a sustained basis. Establishment of  decentralised nurseries would also require credit support.

Potential stakeholders to establish decentralised nurseries

The decentralised nurseries can be established by   farmers, SHGs, State Forest Development Corporations, forest based industries,   NGOs, etc.

Selection of species

The nurseries should plan to produce healthy plants   covering timber, fuel, fodder, fruits, non-wood forest produce and even   ornamental species having good demand in the locality. Besides this the   prevailing agro-climatic conditions in the area should also be taken into   consideration while selecting the species.

Nursery technique

An area of 0.25 ha. has been considered for a viable   nursery wherein 1.25 lakh seedlings can be raised. The size of the nursery   may be increased according to the borrowers category, capacity and demand for   planting material. The nursery should be on a gently sloping land to ensure   proper drainage. Site preparation will be done by ploughing and hoeing the   land. Initially the nursery will be raised in mother beds and will be pricked   out in polypots. It should have water as a perennial source to ensure   adequate supply in hot weather and to reduce costs. The shape will be   rectangular and would measure 100m x 25 m.

Ten seed polybeds would be raised of 10m x 1m i.e. 10   sq m. The number of polybeds required at this stage is at 1:12 ratio i.e. 12   polybeds for each of the primary/seed polybeds. The 1.25 lakh seedlings will   be raised in a total of 120 polybeds (1000 seedlings per polybed) of which   1.20 lakh seedlings would be raised in polybags and remaining 5000 will be   naked rooted seedlings.

The seedlings will be hardened in the nursery by   reducing the water supply over a period of time and exposing them to sunlight   over different durations. This would make them capable of facing adverse   weather conditions once they are transplanted onto the field. The nurseries are   temporary in nature and are of five year duration. During the summer months,   shading may be provided by using polythene sheets or shading nets. Bamboo   mats can also be used for providing shade. Protection measures may be taken   like fencing the area with barbed wire.
