Introduction

The annual income of her family was around Rs. 2 lakhs which did not meet the family expenses and children’s education.
She came to know that the slatted floor goat rearing is a beneficial enterprise.

Training & Motivation


Goat rearing is one of the important aspects in dry land farming system. In rural areas open grazing is a common practice for rearing of goat flocks.
Due to the reduction in open grazing there is a need to search another alternate option i.e. stall feeding or slatted floor goat rearing method.

She attended the training programme and came to know about slatted floor shed construction, breed selection, goat breed up gradation, green fodder production, concentrated feed production, disease management and market linkage.

She is getting an annual income of Rs. 4,37,500 from the sale of 50 goats (9 months age) at an average weight of 30-40 Kg. She is selling FYM to other farmers also.
KVK identified this goat farm as a model slatted floor goat rearing unit for KVK technical programmes.
