Soil Health Card, Soil Conservation and Micronutrients


What to Do?


Always use appropriate fertilizer in right quantity based on soil test.
Must use organic manures to maintain the fertility of soil.
In order to get maximum benefit of the fertilizers, always apply in root zone instead of broadcasting.
Resort to judicious and efficient use of Phosphatic Fertilizers for proper development of roots/shoots and timely maturity of crops, particularly the legumes which fix atmospheric Nitrogen for enrichment of soil.
Farmers desirous of adopting Participatory Organic Guarantee System (PGS – India) Certification system may form a group of at least 5 farmers and get it registered with the nearest Regional Council or Regional Centre of Organic Farming.
Soil Health Card - Under the scheme, Soil Health card will be provided to all farm holdings in the country at an interval of 3 years so as to enable the farmers to apply appropriate recommended dosages of nutrients for crop production and improving soil health and its fertility.
