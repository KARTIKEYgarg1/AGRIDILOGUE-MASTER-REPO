Pradhan  Mantri  Krishi  Sinchai  Yojana  (PMKSY)

PMKSY  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet   Committee on Economic Affairs on 01.07.2015 with an outlay of Rs. 50,000 crore for a period of 5  years (2015-16 to 2019-20).

The vision of PMKSY is to ensure access to some means of protective irrigation to all agricultural  farms in the country - to produce ‘per drop more crop. Thus bringing much desired rural prosperity.   PMKSY is strategized by focusing on end-to end solution in irrigation supply chain, viz. water sources,  distribution  network,  efficient  farm  level  applications,  extension  services  on  new  technologies and   information etc. based on comprehensive planning process at district/State level.
