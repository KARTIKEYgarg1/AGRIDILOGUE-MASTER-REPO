Seaweed Culture


Seaweed  cultivation, as a diversification activity in mariculture, has tremendous potential all along the Indian coast.  Seaweeds are rich in vitamins and minerals and are consumed as food in various parts of the world and used for the production of phytochemicals, viz., agar, carrageenan and alginate, which are widely employed as gelling, stabilizing and thickening agents in several industries of food, confectionery, pharmaceutical, dairy, textile, paper, paint, etc.

In India, seaweeds are used as raw materials for the production of agar, alginate and liquid seaweed fertilizer (LSF). There are a few agar industries, algin industries and LSF industries situated at different places in the maritime states of , Karnataka,  and Gujarat. The red algae Gelidiella acerosa, Gracilaria edulis, G. crassa, G. foliifera and G. verrucosa are used for agar manufacture and brown algae Sargassum spp., Turbinaria spp. and Cystoseira trinodis for the production of alginates an d liquid seaweed fertilizer.  The quantity of seaweeds exploited is inadequate to meet the raw material requirement of Indian seaweed industries.

Seaweeds such as Gracilaria edulis, Hypnea musciformis, Kappaphycus alvarezii, Enteromorpha flexuosa and Acanthophora spicifera can be successfully cultivated in long-line ropes and nets by vegetative propagation method. This activity has a potential to provide income and employment to about 200,000 families.
