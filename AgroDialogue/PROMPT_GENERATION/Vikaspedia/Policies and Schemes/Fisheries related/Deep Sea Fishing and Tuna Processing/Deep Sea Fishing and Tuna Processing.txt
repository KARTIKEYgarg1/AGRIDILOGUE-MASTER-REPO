Deep Sea Fishing and Tuna Processing


The total world catch of the major commercial species of tunas (albacore, bigeye, bluefin, skipjack and yellowfin) has increased almost several folds in the recent years. Tuna species are a significant source of food in many countries.  Of the many areas identified for increase in fish production by the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB), harvesting of the  underutilized deep sea resources such as tuna and tuna-like species is one of them.
