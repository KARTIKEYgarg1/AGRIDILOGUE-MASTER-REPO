Slogans and songs should be used to ease tension and create an enabling environment or to get people back to the focus

Keep valid supporting documents and evidence at hand for ready reference

Be sensitive to other non-MGNREGA grievances. Accept petitions and record issues, however do not let these take over the agenda.

Don't make broad statements/generalisations about corruption and misappropriation
Don't make character judgments about any officials

Do not rely solely on the Panchayat to inform the people about the Gram Sabha
Don't lose your temper, do not get disturbed or lose focus. Be patient 
Never ask whether the person has attended a Gram Sabha before. Ask the number of Gram Sabhas that were held in recent times
Don’t use an accusatory approach
Don't let people hijack the meeting or the issue. Take them aside or tell them they will get a chance to express their opinions later during the day
Don't give false hopes to people or mislead them. The Social Audit team should focus on the timelines for redressal 

Non-negotiable principles of the conduct of Social Audit


The authenticity of the social audit process must be maintained under all circumstances. It should not be politicized
The roles and responsibilities of the Government/Administration and the social audit teams must be clearly delineated and each should respect the pace of the other
No official or political pressure should be brought on to a social audit process
Irrespective of which institution or organisation the person conducting the social audit might belong to, he or she is just a social auditor during the process. He/She shall not bring his/her personal or
organisation's agenda into the social audit process
All records pertaining to the works that are to be audited must be available with the social audit team before the process begins
A social auditor must be an impartial observer of facts. There is no space for personal opinions or likes and dislikes during the social audit process or at the time of writing the report. Only hard facts should be reported
The short comings in the implementation of the scheme at the village should be reported on an as-is basis with proof. Social audit reports must necessarily contain proofs on issues being mentioned
All the aspects of the scheme must be closely examined during the social audit process
One cannot jump to conclusions and form generalisations on the basis of talking to just a few persons. The issues must be discussed with all the wage seekers and the beneficiaries of the scheme before a decision is taken
There can be no space for any discrimination in the social audit process based on gender, caste, religion, class or occupation.

Community Mobilisation

Community mobilisation for the Gram Sabha/Public Hearing (Jan Sunwai) is an integral part of the social audit process. Community is a group of people living in the same place and/or having a particular characteristic in common. Communities can be based on their caste, religion, language, territory, common culture, principles, norms and practices, or common concerns. The most vulnerable groups in the village comefrom the lower castes, classes and other groups facing marginalisation and exclusion. Those who have seen or experienced oppressive domination in their own lives understand the complexity of the situation. Mobilisation is the process of convincing, and gathering people around a particular issue or sets of issues. Once people are mobilised, they can be organised for further action.

In rural India, mobilising marginalised communities is a challenge due to:


the caste-based hierarchical society
class-based domination of certain sections of people by others in the village
 the ways in which power is exercised by these sections to further their own interests.
gendered power-relations

Social auditors can use various tools and strategies to mobilise communities such as:


Group discussion: Informing people about MGNREGA through group discussion
Door-to-door verification: informing people about their rights and entitlements during door-to-door Verification
Ward Sabha: Social auditors can organise a ward Sabha and discuss about MGNREGA and create
awareness about their rights and entitlements
A rally of school children with MGNREGA posters and slogans
Street play (Nukkad Natak)
Puppet show
Cultural programme
Folk songs and musical instruments
Involvement and Participation of Local Groups: Brief about MGNREGA and social audit to local groups including SHGs (with special emphasis on women SHG members), Bharat Nirman Volunteers, Motivators, Youth and Sports Clubs, Cultural Groups and involve them in the social audit process
Screening documentaries on village development, empowerment of workers and women, MGNREGA, RTI, Social Audit The focus of tools and strategies of community mobilisation needs to be on inclusion of the poor and socially excluded

Social Audit Unit

According to the MGNREGA, every State needs to set up a Social Audit Unit (SAU) which will be independent from the agency that is implementing MGNREGA in the State. The SAU can be registered as a Society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The SAU must be headed by a full-time Director who should have worked in the social sector for the rights of the people for at least 15 years.

The key persons in the SAU include:


SAU Director
Social Development Specialist/Consultant
State Resource Persons and thematic experts
District Resource Persons (DRPs)
