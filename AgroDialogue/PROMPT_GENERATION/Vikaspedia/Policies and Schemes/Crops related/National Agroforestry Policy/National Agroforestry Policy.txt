National Agroforestry Policy


Agroforestry is defined as a land use system which integrate trees and shrubs on farmlands and rural landscapes to enhance productivity, profitability, diversity and ecosystem  sustainability.  It  is  a  dynamic,  ecologically  based,  natural  resource management system that, through integration of woody perennials on farms and in the  agricultural  landscape,  diversifies  and  sustains  production  and  builds  social institutions.

Major  policy  initiatives,  including  the  National  Forest Policy 1988, the National Agriculture Policy 2000, Planning Commission Task Force on Greening India 2001, National Bamboo Mission 2002, National Policy on Farmers, 2007 and Green India Mission 2010, emphasize the role of agroforestry for efficient nutrient  cycling,  organic  matter  addition  for  sustainable  agriculture  and  for improving  vegetation  cover.  However,  agroforestry  has  not  gained  the  desired importance as a resource development tool due to various factors.

A policy which deals with problems faced by agroforestry sector, including  adverse policies, weak markets and a dearth of institutional finance was approved by the Cabinet in February 2014. India became the world's first country to adopt a comprehensive agroforestry policy.

Basic objectives


Encourage  and  expand  tree  plantation  in  complementarity  and  integrated manner  with  crops  and  livestock  to  improve  productivity,  employment, income  and  livelihoods  of  rural  households,  especially  the  small  holder farmers. 
Protect and stabilize ecosystems, and promote resilient cropping and farming systems to minimize the risk during extreme climatic events. 
Meet the raw material requirements of wood based industries and reduce import of wood and wood products to save foreign exchange. 
Supplement  the  availability  of  agroforestry  products  (AFPs),  such  as  the fuel-wood, fodder, non-timber forest produce and small timber of the rural and tribal populations, thereby reducing the pressure on existing forests. 
Complement achieving the target of increasing forest/tree cover to promote ecological stability, especially in the vulnerable regions. 
Develop  capacity  and  strengthen  research  in  agroforestry  and  create  a massive people's movement for achieving these objectives and to minimize pressure on existing forests. 

Strategy


 Establishment of Institutional Setup at National level to promote Agroforestry 

An institutional mechanism, such as a Mission or Board is to be established for implementing  the  agroforestry  policy.  It  will  provide  the  platform  for  the multi-stakeholders  to  jointly  plan  and  identify  the  priorities  and  strategies,  for inter-ministerial  coordination,  programmatic  convergence,  financial  resources mobilization  and  leveraging,  capacity  building  facilitation,  and  technical  and management  support. 
The Ministry of Agriculture has the mandate for agroforestry. Agroforestry Mission / Board will be located in the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation (DAC) in the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA). 
The actual implementation may involve convergence and dovetailing with a number of programmes. 
Agroforestry  research  and  development  (R&amp;D),  including  capacity development  and  pilot  studies  /  testing  and  action  research  should  be  the responsibility of the ICAR
In  the  proposed  institutional  arrangement  the  current  stakes  of  the  key ministries are to be respected and utilized.

Simple regulatory mechanism - There is a need to create simple mechanisms / procedures to regulate the harvesting and transit of agroforestry produce within the State, as well as in various States forming an ecological region. There is also the need to simplify procedures, with permissions extended on automatic route as well as approval mode through a transparent system within a given time schedule. There are regulations imposed by multiple agencies of State governments (viz.  Department of Forest, land revenue, other local bodies) on harvesting and transit which have negative implications on the 8 growth of agroforestry. All these restricting regulations need to be identified and aligned with the proposed simplified mechanism. 
Development of a sound database &amp; information system 
Investing in research, extension and capacity building and related services
Improving famers’ access to quality planting material
Providing institutional credit and insurance cover for agroforestry
Facilitating  increased  participation  of  industries  dealing  with  agroforestry produce
Strengthening farmer access to markets for tree products.
Incentives to farmers for adopting agroforestry
Promoting sustainable agroforestry for renewable biomass based energy
