It is estimated that by the end of the 6 years period i.e. 2020-21, 100 clusters will have taken shape. This will directly and indirectly benefit at least 160 individual per cluster. It is estimated that during this implementation period, the total involvement of individuals mostly women (WSHGs), who will be gainfully engaged in employment in the jute diversification, will be to the tune of at least 15,000.

The outcome of the scheme would also establish the competitive environmental  advantages of jute globally as well as boost the sale of jute goods  globally and increase the share of JDPs too.

Over a period of time, consumption of raw jute will be increased. The environment will remain safe for the mankind as jute is a natural and earth-friendly material.
