The Centrally Sponsored Fodder Development Scheme has been modified from 2010 to ensure efficient use of available fodder/feed. The modification has been done on the recommendations of the Working Group on Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries.  The scheme incorporates the following components/technology interventions:


Strengthening of Feed Testing      Laboratories 
Introduction of Chaff cutters

Further the amount of subsidy given under the ongoing component, Establishment of Fodder Block Making Units has been increased to 50% to encourage better participation and the land requirement for assistance under the Grassland Development including Grass Reserves component has been revised to 5-10 Hq.
