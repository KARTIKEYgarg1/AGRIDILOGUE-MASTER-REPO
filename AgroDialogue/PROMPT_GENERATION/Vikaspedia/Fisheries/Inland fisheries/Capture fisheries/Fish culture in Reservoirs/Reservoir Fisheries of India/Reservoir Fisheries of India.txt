Reservoir Fisheries of India


Inland fisheries

India is blessed with huge and untapped fishery potential. It has 29000 km of rivers, 0.3 million hectares of estuarine, 0.19 million hectares of backwater and lagoons, 3.15 million hectare of reservoirs and 0.2 million hectares of floodplain wetlands and 0.72 hectares of upland lakes.  The  manmade  reservoir  resources  cover   more  than  3.0  million  ha  water  spread  area   and  are  mostly  distributed  in  varied  climatic   environment  congenial  for  fish  growth.  .

There are 14 larger rivers, 44 medium rivers, and innumerable small rivers present in India.

The larger river production of fish has ranged from 0.64 tons to 1.64 tons with an average of 1 ton. However, major landings are being obtained from the reservoirs and floodplain area, which are attained through culture management practices.

The  total  fish   production   during   2015-16   (provisional)   is    at  10.79  million  metric  tonne  (MMT)  with  a   contribution  of  7.21  MMT  from  inland  sector   and  3.58  MMT  from  marine  sector. Inland  fisheries  presently  has  a  share  of  66.81% in total fish production of the country.

In recent decades, the culture fisheries in inland water bodies has received considerable attention. Within  inland  fisheries  there  is  a  shift   from  capture  fisheries  to  aquaculture  during   the  last  two  and  a  half  decade.    Freshwater   aquaculture with a share of 34 percent in inland  fisheries  in  mid-1980s  has  increased  to  about   80  percent  in  recent  years.  It  has  emerged  as   a  major  fish  producing  system  in  India  as  a   result  of  initiatives  taken  by  the  Government.

Reservoir Fisheries

The reservoirs are classified based on the water spread area and water-holding capacity. The reservoirs are classified into large (>5000 hectares), medium  (1001 - 5000 hectare) and small reservoir (<1000 hectare). There are  56 large reservoirs having a water area of 1140268 hectares, 180 medium  reservoirs having a water area of 527541 hectares and 19134 small  reservoirs having a water area of 1485557 hectares.

A maximum number of small reservoirs are in  with an area of 315941 hectares (8895 nos.) and is followed by Karnataka (228657 hectares) and  (201927 hectares). A larger part of the medium reservoirs are in Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Karnataka has the highest number (12) of the large reservoirs with an area of 179556 followed by Andhra Pradesh which has 7 larger reservoirs with an area of 190151 hectares. About 56% of total reservoir area of the country are distributed in the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Odisha, and Maharashtra.

Reservoir productivity

The reservoir productivity is influenced by the climatic, morphometric and hydro edaphic features. The geographic location alters the reservoir productivity, nutritional supply and basin characteristics. Among the climate variables, the temperature, rainfall and wind can change the productivity of water bodies. The air and water temperature fluctuation is comparatively lower in southern peninsular than in northern peninsular across different seasons which prevents the thermal stratification. In addition, the rainfall determines the inflow rate of water into the reservoir and this contributes to the water replenishment and nutrient enrichment. The wind helps to maintain even temperature among the entire water body, and normally, this is high during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons.

The morphometry of reservoir is a function of the dam depth and topography of area. The reservoir potential is determined by the depth of the tank. A shallow lake has greater productivity (euphotic zone) due to better mixing of heat and nutrient. A larger reservoir has lower productivity, because the nutrient sinks at the bottom, where organic matter accumulatesÂ  and this is not available in the photosynthesis zone.

The Morphoedaphic index used to estimate the potential of the reservoir can be calculated by using the following formula.

Morphoedaphic index = total dissolved solids (mg/l) / mean depth (m).

In India, majority of the reservoirs fall under low productivity, which has the water quality parameters pH is less than 6.0, alkalinity is less than 40mg/l. The soil parameters such as the pH are less than 6.5, available nitrogen is less than 3.0mg/100g, available nitrogen is less than 25mg/100g and organic carbon is less than 0.5%. The total dissolved solids and specific conductivity directly influence the productivity of the reservoirs.

The soil pH is one of the important parameter, which regulates the productivity of the water bodies. If the pH value is less than 6 then it is a low productivity reservoir, 6.5 - 7.5 is termed medium productivity and more than pH 7.5 is termed a high productivity reservoir.

Fish production from reservoirs

The   average fish production potential was estimated  at 250 kg/ha of reservoirs.

Reservoir category and state wise production and yield kg ha-1 is presented in the Table given below. An estimated average fish yield kg ha-1 is greater in the small reservoir at 49.9 kg/ha, followed by the medium reservoir (12.3 kg ha-1) and larger reservoir (11.43kg ha-1). The average reservoir production of the nation is 20 kg ha-1.

The production of the reservoir is 93650 tons of the potential of the reservoir of 245134 tons. There is scope to increases the fish production by about 50% in the small reservoirs, 16.39% in medium and 22.85 % in larger reservoirs; it means an average total fish potential could increase by about 38%. By stocking of larger size fingerlings and providing formulated feed, an average production of 500kg ha-1 can be achieved.
