Frozen trout

Rainbow trout can be kept in good condition by freezing and holding in a cold store. Packing individual fish in polyethylene cover is effective in reducing dehydration and oxidation of the frozen product. Frozen whole trout remained in good condition at -18 ° C for 12 months.

Smoked trout

The most common form of value addition of  trout is as whole gutted, hot smoked product. It is cooked enough during the process, so as to be presented as a ready to eat product. CIFT has standardized the technique for the preparation of smoked products from this fish. The whole fish was; beheaded, gutted, split open and cold blanched in 10% brine for 15 minutes. It was then hot smoked at 60°C for three hours to obtain the desired colour and flavour. Storage studies under chilled conditions showed that vacuum, packed smoked trout had a longer shelf life of 11 weeks when compared to air packed samples.

Coated fillets

Coated product is a much sought after value added item. Battering and breading improve he appearance. Skinless fillets obtained, from whole trout were cold blanched in 5% salt and 0.1% citric acid for 10 minutes before breading and battering. This product remained good  for twelve months in frozen storage at -18 ° C.

Canned trout

The whole fish was gutted, washed and made into steaks of, uniform size. It was cold blanched in 10% NaCl containing 0.5% citric acid for 10 minutes and smoked at 45 ° C for two hours and given a partial drying for one hour. Approximately 120g of steaks were finger packed in 307 X 109 TFS cans. The cans were heat processed at 121°C in refined groundnut oil. Smoked and canned trout steak in oil is an excellent product with a shelf life of more than one year at ambient conditions.
