Pregnancy In Ruminants


What is pregnancy


When the male mates with the female he deposits sperm in the vagina. 
The sperm joins with the egg and forms the embryo which becomes attached to the wall of the womb. 
The embryo grows within a bag of fluid (water bag) and is attached to the wall of the womb by a navel cord. 

Signs of pregnancy


Heat stops when pregnancy begins. 
The animal becomes quieter and the belly grows bigger. 
In milk animals the production of milk will gradually drop. 

Length of pregnancy


If male and female animals have been allowed to run together in a large herd it will be difficult to determine the expected time for birth (parturition). 
If however you do know when a female was mated or given artificial insemination you can determine when she will give birth. 
The length of pregnancy differs in different animals.




Animal
Length of pregnancy


Cow
280 days


Buffalo
320 days


Sheep
150 days


Goat
150 days



Â 

There can be a few days difference either way depending on the type, climate, feed and other factors.

Management of the pregnant animal


You must remember that a pregnant animal will need more feed and will benefit from the addition of some grain to the feed towards the end of pregnancy. 
All pregnant animals should be kept close to home towards the end of the pregnancy and some form of shelter should be provided. 
They should be watched twice a day for signs that parturition is close. 
In particular cattle and buffalo need a clean, well ventilated place, preferably with a sand or grit floor on which suitable bedding is placed. 
Do not keep a pregnant animal constantly tied up or with little room to exercise in. Allow her some freedom in a field or yard each day.
