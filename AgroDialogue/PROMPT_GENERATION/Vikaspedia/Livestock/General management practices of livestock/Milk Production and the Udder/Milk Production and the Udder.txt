Milk Production and the Udder


The main purpose of the milk is to feed the young. A good milking animal can produce more milk than her young need.

How milk is made


The udder of the cow and buffalo has four quarters, each quarter having a teat. 
In the sheep and goat the udder is divided into two with two teats.


How milk is made


Milk is produced in the udder from nutrients in the blood which flows through the vessels (tubes) in each quarter. 
The greater the amount of blood passing through the udder the greater the amount of milk which is produced. 
The milk is released as the teat is sucked or squeezed. 
Milking by hand will take from 5 to 10 minutes. 
The udder should be emptied at each milking and this will stimulate the udder to develop more milk. Always milk the animal quietly. 
A good time to milk is in the morning before the animal goes out to graze and in the evening. 
Always milk at the same time each day.

Differences in milk yields

Milk yields will vary for different reasons:


Some types or breeds of animals produce more milk than others. 
Milk production will be greater after the birth of the second or third young. 
Extra good feed, minerals and a lot of water are needed by the animal in milk in order to produce milk. 
Milk production improves when the animal gives birth in the rainy season when there is a lot of feed available. 
Talking, singing or whistling to the sheep, cow, goat or buffalo as it is being milked makes it relax and the milk is let down better. 
Some individuals naturally give more milk than others. These individuals should be selected for breeding.
