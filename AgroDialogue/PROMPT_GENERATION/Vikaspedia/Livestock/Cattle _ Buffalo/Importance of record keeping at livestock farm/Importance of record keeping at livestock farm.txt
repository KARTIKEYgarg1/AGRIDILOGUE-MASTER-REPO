Importance of record keeping at livestock farm


Record keeping is a necessary element of good livestock business management. With no written records, farmers have to depend on their memory while making decisions regarding their farm practices. But, memories can become unreliable after a few days, months or years. Thus, recording of the performances of the animals can be done easily if animals have some identifications / numberings. Thus, both animal recording and identification are always required. There are several useful records such as production and financial transactions in the dairy enterprise. If we know what is happening on the dairy farm we need to maintain some useful farm records. Farm records are like the progress report cards students get at school. If farmers have farm records, they can tell how well they are managing their farm in comparison to other farmers.  They can also see the strengths and weaknesses in their farm operations. It is also important to have accurate facts and figures when borrowing money, seeking government loans and tax returns.

Advantages of record keeping at farm


Records provides basis for evaluation of animals from past records hence helps in selection and culling animals
Helps in preparing pedigree and history record of animals.
Helps in assessing the past records and designing better breeding plans to check inbreeding, selecting superior parents and helps in better replacement and culling practices.
Helps in progeny testing of bulls.
Helps in analysing feeding cost and benefits from animal product outputs. Hence helps to formulate economic feeding strategies for optimal productions.
Helps in detection of abnormal conditions or disease status of the herd that leads to loss in body weight, loss in milk production etc.
Helps in finding the commonly occurring diseases in the herd and thus to formulate in time precautionary measures like vaccination, deworming etc.
Helps in fixing proper prices of animal meant for purchase and sale.
Helps in overall better supervision and management of herd.
Helps in ascertaining the income and expenditure (economics) of dairy farm.
Helps in estimating the cost of milk production.
Helpful in comparing the efficiency of labour and herd with other farms.
To compare the herd performances in different years to determine the amount of profit/loss each year and setting future goals/directions for the farm.
