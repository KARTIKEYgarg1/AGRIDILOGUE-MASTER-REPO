Dairy farm – Buildings 

Milch Animal Shed

The milch animal shed should have the following parts


Feeding passage
Manger
Standing space
Gutter or drainage channel
Milking passage

The milch animals can be housed according to number of animals available.

 Single row system: In single row system, 12-16 numbers of animals can be kept.  Double row system 

If it is greater than 16, then double row system is preferable.
In double row system up to 50 animals can be maintained in a single shed.
The distance between two sheds should be greater than 30 feet or it should be twice the height of the building.

In double row system two methods available. They are


1. Tail to tail system (out-method)

Advantages 

Cleaning and milking of animals      easy. 
Supervision of milking also easy. 
Less chance for transmission of      diseases from animal to animal. 
Animals can get more fresh air      from outside. 


2. Head to head system (in-method)

Advantages

Getting animals into the shed is      easy. 
Feeding of animals also easy. 
Disinfection of gutter will be      more due to the direct fall of sunrays over the gutter. 
Animals are better exhibited to      visitors 

 Disadvantages

Milking supervision is difficult. 
Possibilities of transmission of      disease are more.

Milking Barn / Milk parlour


This is a barn where milch animals are milked and is      fully covered.
 It should be      located at the centre of the farm with all other farm buildings arranged      around it. 
There shall be an individual standing in the milking      barns and the number of standings required should be 25% of total number      of milch animals in the herd. 
The milking operation should be      carried out in batches.

Dimensions of milking barn 

Length of standing space : 1.5 –      1.7 m 
Width of standing space  : 1.05 – 1.2m (80% of length, of      standing space) 
Width of central passage  :      1.5 – 1.8 m 
Width of feed alley               : 0.75 m 
Width of      gutter                : 0.30 m 
Overhang                              : 0.75 m 

Down calver shed/ calving pen


Pregnant animals are transferred      to a calving pen 2 to 3 weeks before the expected date of calving.
Calving pen of 3m x 4m (12 m2)      is essential to keep the animals in advanced stage of pregnancy. 
It should be located nearer to the      farmer’s quarters for better supervision. 
The number of calving pens      required is 10% of the number of total breedable female stock in the farm. 

Calf pen


This is meant for housing young calves separately.
It can be located either at the end or on the side of the milking barn.
This facilitates taking calves to their dams quickly.
If there are large numbers of calves, the separate unit of calf shed should be arranged and located nearer to the milking barn.

Young stock/ heifer shed


It is meant for housing young heifers separately.
Older heifers calves from about six months of age to breeding age are to be housed separately from the suckling calves.
When a large number of young stocks are there, they should be divided into different age groups and each group housed separately.

Dry animal shed


In large farms, milch and dry cows      are housed separately.
The floor in the covered area      should preferably be made of cement concrete. 
Under Indian conditions, in      smaller farms, milch and dry animals can be housed together. 
Normally, one third of the animals      in a farm will be in dry or in dry cum pregnant stage. 

Bull shed


It is meant for housing bulls separately in a farm.
It should be constructed towards one end of the farm.
There shall be one shed for each bull.
The number of bulls required being one for every 50 breedable females on the farm, if natural breeding is practiced.
When artificial insemination service facilities are available, no necessary to keep the bulls on the farm.
The bull shed shall have covered 3x4 metre dimensions, leading into a paddock of 120 square metres.

Isolation shed


It is the separation of sick      animals from apparently healthy animals to avoid transmission of diseases      to healthy stock. 
It should be located at the corner      of the shed so that these sheds are inaccessible to other animals. 

Quarantine shed


It should be located at the      entrance of the farm. 
The newly purchased animals      entering into the farm should be kept in quarantine shed for a minimum      period of 30 to 40 days to watch out for any disease occurrence. 

Accessory buildings

Store room


All the four walls should be      closed and it should be rat proof. 
There should be one concrete store      room with feed mixing unit at a distant place and a smaller feed store      room behind the milking parlour. 

Milk room


It is essential to keep the milk      and also to chill the milk in larger dairies having 400 to 700 litres      production capacity that requires 3.7 m x 5m size of room and an      additional 0.37 m2 for every 40 litres of milk production. 
For a smaller dairy unit below 100      litres a small room with a dimension of 3.75m x 3m can be sufficient for      storing milk and concentrate feed. 

Hay or straw shed


An adult animal consume about 5 to      10 Kg of hay or straw per day, while young stock consume about 2 to 5 kg      of hay or straw per day. 
The annual requirement can be      calculated and the space requirement can be arrived.

Common housing methods for dairy animals

Loose Housing


It is a system of housing in which      animals are kept loose in an open paddock throughout the day and night      except at the time of milking and treatment. 
In this system, shelter is      provided along one side of open paddock under which animals can retire      when it is very hot or cold or during rains. 
Common feed manger and water tank      is provided and concentrates are fed at the milking time which is done in      a separate milking barn or parlour in which cows are secured at milking      time and are milked. 
The open paddock is enclosed by      means of half walls or plain wire fences of convenient height. 

Advantages 

Cost of construction is cheaper. 
Future expansion is possible. 
The animals will move freely so that it will get sufficient exercise. 
The animal can be kept clean. 
Common feeding and watering arrangement is possible. 
 is possible because the animals are milked in a separate milking barn. 
Oestrus detection is easy. 
At least 10-15 percent more stock than standard can be accommodated for shorter period. 

Disadvantages 

It is not suitable for temperate Himalayan region and heavy rainfall areas. 
It requires more floor space. 
There is competition for feed. 
Attention of individual animal is not possible. 
A separate milking barn is needed for milking of animals. 

Conventional Barns or Stanchion Barns


In this system of housing, the      animals are confined together on a platform and secured at neck by      stanchions or neck chain. 
The animals are fed as wells as      milked in the same barn.
These barns are completely covered      with roofs and the sidewalls are closed with windows or ventilator located      at suitable places to get more ventilation and lighting. 
It is applicable for temperate and      heavy rainfall region. 
The same type of housing can be      utilized for tropical region with slight modification. 

Advantages 

The animals and men caring for      animals are less exposed to harsh environment. 
The animals can be kept clean. 
Diseases are better controlled. 
Individual care can be given. 
Separate milking barn is not      required. 

Disadvantages 

Cost of construction is more. 
Future expansion is difficult. 
Not suitable for hot and humid      climatic conditions
