Requirements of a Good Project

The project should include the following information on technical, financial and managerial aspects in detail based on type of unit and capacity.

Technical:


Nearness of the selected area to veterinary centres and wool collection centre and the financing bank's branch
Availability of good quality animals in nearby livestock markets
Source of training facilities.
Availability of good grazing ground / lands.
Availability of green/dry fodder, concentrate feed, medicines etc.
Availability of veterinary aid and marketing facilities near the scheme area.

Financial:


Unit Cost - The average cost of Sheep unit.
Input cost for feed and fodder, veterinary aid, insurance, etc.
Output costs i.e. sale price of animals, penning etc.
Income-expenditure statement and annual gross surplus.
Cash flow analysis.
Repayment schedule i.e. repayment of principal loan amount and interest.

Appraisal of the project

The project so formulated considering the above mentioned aspects should be submitted to the nearest branch of the bank for availing credit facility for establishment of the sheep farm. The bank will then examine the project for its technical feasibility, financial viability and bankability.
