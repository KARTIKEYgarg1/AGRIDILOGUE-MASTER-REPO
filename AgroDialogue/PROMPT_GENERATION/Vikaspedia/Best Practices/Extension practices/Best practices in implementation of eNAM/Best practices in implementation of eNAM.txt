Best practices in implementation of eNAM

Introduction
e - National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) is a pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the existing APMC Mandis for creating a unified national market for agricultural commodities. The e-NAM Portal provides a single window service for all APMC related information and services. This includes commodity arrivals and prices, buy and sell trade offers, provision to respond to trade offers, among other services.

The focus areas with regards to implementation of e-National Agriculture Market, are as follows:
Notifying and trading commodities on e-NAM.
Increasing the participation of traders on e-NAM.
Increasing the quantity and value of commodities being traded on e-NAM.
Increasing the number of bids quoted by traders.
Promoting cashless transactions, e.g. online payments to farmers.
Promoting inter-market trade between Mandis.
Providing access to Soil Testing Laboratories for farmers
Conducting awareness and farmer orientation programmes.
Providing basic amenities and facilities for cleaning, sorting and packing to farmers in Mandi.
Making logistics and infrastructure available to promote inter-market trade on e-NAM platform.
Providing assaying lab facilities to farmers for grading the produce.
Ensuring transparency and accountability in implementation of the scheme.

Best Practices for Replication

Awareness:
For effective implementation of the programme, it is imperative that proper awareness related to e-Mandis is created by Agriculture, Horticulture, Revenue and other allied departments to farmers and other stakeholders using both print and digital media.
Training programmes and workshops for farmers, traders and APMC’s staff along with banks may be conducted to educate them about cashless transactions, benefits and modalities of the programme.
Residence from existing network of commission agents/middlemen in the system needs to be hand-held with proper awareness drives.

Direct Purchase Centre (DPC):
For inter-state APMC trading, unified licenses may be obtained by districts. Direct Purchase Centre (DPC) platform at mandis facilitates trading without a commission agent at Nizamabad, Telangana.

Infrastructure:
Upgrading the infrastructure by setting up facilities like Assaying lab, Soil Testing lab, Krishi Soochna Kendra, Godowns and Kisan Vishram Grah, installation of LED screens to display all India market prices for commodities, CCTV cameras for transparency may enhance performance of mandis.
Use of technology must be promoted. SMS Informing about the highest bid price of the produce should be sent to each farmer on his mobile at Rajkot, Gujarat.
A helpdesk and complaint cell for redressal of grievances of the farmers should also be established.

Convergence:
In addition to other interventions, it is extremely important that other Government schemes such as Solar Photo Voltaic Pump, Soil Health Card Scheme, National Food Security Mission, Beej Gram Yojana, among others, be converged with e-NAM for multifold results.

Suggestions for Effective Implementation
Strengthening of the farmer value chain through effective utilisation of e-NAM platform is essential. This will result in increase the quantity of each commodity traded at a better price.
It was observed that the biggest challenge is dependency on local traders or commission agents for selling the produce which can be taken care of with the use of Direct Purchase Centres (DPC).
Proper access to logistics and infrastructure facilities for trading on e-NAM should be made available in the premises of e-Mandi.
Facilities for solid and liquid waste management should also be built in the premises. Direct Marketing should be encouraged by providing transport and storage facilities in the local markets.
Further, marketing intelligence and price forecasting models should be used to help farmers in deciding their crops.
In addition to that, use of digital or cashless payment systems should be encouraged for reducing the delay in payments caused due to presence of middlemen.
There may also be integration of mandis into a common farmer net to link all services such as irrigation subsidies, loans, input subsidies, e-trade, cold storage facility based on Aadhaar. These may be further linked with agricultural census, village revenue accounts and distress relief.

Enabling e-Selling for Farmers
Jaisbir Singh, a resident of village Sahuwala in Sirsa, Haryana grows cotton and wheat. Most of the farmers in the area were dependent on local traders/commission agents for selling their produce.

However, things changed for better when Singh got to know about e-National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) through pamphlets displayed as part of an information dissemination process at the Gram Panchayat office. He then participated in the awareness and training camp organised in the local mandi.

To put things in perspective, Singh quotes an example in which he got `5,950 per quintal for cotton while making sales and transaction online through e-NAM. Whereas on the other hand, the offline local price for the same commodity, on the same day was `5,850 per quintal. It turned out to be a significant difference for a farmer dependent on agricultural produce. Singh attributes the rise in return on investment and consequent prosperity to e-NAM.

The mandi adopted e-NAM programme in October 2016. Since then, the market has about 706 licensed commission agents, 366 traders and 1,40,328 farmers up to March 31, 2018 who primarily deal in commodities like wheat, paddy, cotton, mustard, guar, barley, gram etc.

e-NAM facilitates cashless transactions, which reduce the cost and burden of handling cash, which in turn facilitates farmers to strike a deal even during late hours.

However, it was not easy to implement the Scheme in the District. The biggest challenge was farmers’ dependency on local traders/commission agents for selling their produce.

Another key issue was the lack of access to logistic support for trading on e-NAM for which infrastructure facilities were made available in the premises of e-Mandi.

Assaying labs were setup within the market yard. To enhance the infrastructure to support e-NAM facilities, high speed lease-line internet facility is provided for gate entry, exit control and system for e-bidding.

As a result, Sirsa has obtained one unified license for inter-state APMCs trading. The mandis are charging only 1-2% as mandi tax from traders and farmers are exempted from any additional levy on their produce.
