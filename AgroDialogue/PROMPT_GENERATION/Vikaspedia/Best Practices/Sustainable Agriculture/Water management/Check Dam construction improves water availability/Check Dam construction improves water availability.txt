Construction of check dam
He is one of the oldest farmer in the village Madaram.  Earlier he faced water scarcity for cultivating his crops. He thought that   if he constructs a check dam, it will be useful to him as well as to nearest farm land because ground water level will increase.

Last year (2013) he applied for government assistance to construct a check dam under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP). He got the amount sanctioned to build a check dam in his land where rain water can be stored. Estimated cost of this check dam is Rs 2 lakhs. Now 8 farmers having 30 acres surrounding his farm land are getting benefits due to the construction of the Check dam. Farmers  depend on the water stored in the check dam to feed their cattle. Even during summer, water is available in the check dam.

Feed back
According to him, Government is providing lot of schemes to farmers like Watershed Management Programme.
Proper awareness is needed among the farmers to get the benefits of schemes.
Government plays an important role in creating awareness about such schemes among the community.
