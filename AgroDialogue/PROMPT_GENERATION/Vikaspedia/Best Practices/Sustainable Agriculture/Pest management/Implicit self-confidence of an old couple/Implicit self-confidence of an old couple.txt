Implicit self-confidence of an old couple

Mahaboobi, a 59 years of old daily wage worker, has changed her life with the adoption of organic farming. Her husband, Mahaboob Basha, a 65 years of old man to a vehement follower of it. Though advance in age desired to live a self-reliant life, the couple didn’t have source of income for their livelihood because of dissertation of their two sons. This poorest of the poor family is living in Tadakanapalli village of Kalluru mandal of Karnool district (A.P). They made their hearts strong and decided to be independent. Meanwhile the door of luck opened a new chapter in their lives through Indira Kranthi Patham (I.K.P.) and tried their luck. They were guided by village activist (V.A.) and cluster activist (C.A.) to adopt non pesticides management (N.P.M.) method. They borrowed Rs.10, 000/- from village organization (V.O.) took an acre of land for lease and started cultivation.

By the encouragement of (V.O.) President, a woman N.P.M. farmer Ms. Jubeda Bee and also with the co-operation of N.P.M. officials made them implicit to cultivate organic farming. Her husband supports in all her endeavors, likewise mother Earth too bestowed them with good crop and yielding. They used traditional method for cultivation by ploughing the land in summer. Soil fertility management, seed treatment, use of ganajeevamrutham etc. were non-negotiable.

The land was divided into two parts. They cultivated leafy vegetables in ½ acre and in the remaining foster vegetables with 10 guntas model. They planted lady’s finger, maize as boarder crop and castor as trap crop for the protection of main crop. The income from the sale of leafy vegetables was very promising. With renewed energy, they continued to nurture their crops and were waiting to get good yield from the other vegetable crops. As they have waited, their dreams were shattered by the disastrous floods which washed away the crop. Never the less, grit to overcome the loss had been paid by them.

Again they borrowed Rs.10, 000/- from the V.O. towards the lease and agricultural inputs to cultivate groundnut.  They ploughed the land in summer and applied 2 quintals of neem cake in the first week of June, then sowed the seeds. Like earlier, they planted inter crop, boarder and trap crops to raise their economic self-dependency. Thus organic farming has invigorated them and they toiled with determination.

They owe their success to mother Earth for blessing them with good yielding and raising their standard of living than the cruel which the couple had experienced from their children. They have no other obligation except agriculture but regularly attend the V.O. meetings like well-disciplined school children every month on 12th and 26th also on 6th and 20th for  self-help group (S.H.G.) meetings memorably. In the meeting they allocate and discuss about N.P.M. method of cultivation and its earnings.
