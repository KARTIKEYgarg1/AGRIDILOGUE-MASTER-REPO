Bio-pesticides should be given priority over chemical pesticides.
Pest Defender ratio to be assessed by farmers before using any pesticide. Agro Eco System Analysis (AESA) based Integrated Pest Management should be adopted.
Grow such crops surrounding/near the main crop (inter cropping/border cropping) which attract farmer friendly insects which can manage/kill harmful insects.
Resort to deep ploughing during summer season.
Use pest resistant varieties of crops and manage pests by adopting crop rotation, inter cropping and trap-cropping.
Use light trap/sticky trap/pheromone trap for monitoring and mass trapping of the pests.
Use parasitoids and predators for biological control of the insects, pests and antagonists for diseases.
