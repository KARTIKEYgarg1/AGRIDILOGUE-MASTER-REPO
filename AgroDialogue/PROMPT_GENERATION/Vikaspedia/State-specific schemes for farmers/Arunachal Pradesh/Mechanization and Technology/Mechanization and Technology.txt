Mechanization and Technology


What to Do?


Procure appropriate machinery/ equipment as per land holding size and crop
Machinery &amp; equipment can be used by Custom Hiring/sharing by groups of farmers
Conserve Resources - Use Zero-till Seed Drill, Laser Leveler,Happy Seed Drill Rotavator, etc.
Training is provided on proper use of Farm Machinery and its routine maintenance and servicing through Farm
Machinery Training &amp;Testing Institutes (FMTTIs), KVKs &amp; State Agricultural Universities.
