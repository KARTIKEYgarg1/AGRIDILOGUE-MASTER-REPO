Mass production of Trichogramma spp.


Mass production of Corcyra cephalonica (Laboratory host for Trichogramma spp.)




Materials required




Sterilized sorghum
Corcyra rearing boxes/trays/jars made up of plastic or wood with lid provided with wire mesh for aeration
Corcyra egg laying cage
Black cloth
Mosquito net
Table
Racks for placing Corcyra cages





Honey
Glycerin
Tubes for collecting Corcyra moth
Measuring cylinder
Plastic tubs for egg laying purpose
Brush
Roasted ground nut powder - 100 grams




Yeast - 5 grams
Wettable sulphur - 5 grams
Streptomycin sulphate - 0.05 gms

Preparation of egg laying cage of Corcyra cepholonica

 

 

Take a plastic bucket with lid. Cut the lid in circular shape leaving space for providing /fixing wire mesh for egg laying purpose in the (circular wire mesh). Make a hole on the centre of bottom of the plastic bucket to pour the collected adults in the bucket. Keep bucket inverted in the plastic tub for egg laying purposes.

Steps for production of Corcyra cephalonica




Sterilize the rearing boxes (if wooden) in hot air oven for 100 degree centigrade for 30 minutes
If plastic trays are used, wash them before use
Dry broken grains of jowar in sunlight properly
Pour sterilized grain - 2.5 kg/box/tray
Add 100 grams of roasted ground nut powder, 5 grams of yeast, 5 grams of wettable sulphur, 0.05 gms of streptomycin sulphate in each box or tray





Mix well all ingredients
Sprinkle 1 cubic centimeter of Corcyra eggs/box/tray on the top of mixture(culture medium)
Cover the box with lid, label the date of inoculation
Keep these boxes in racks protected by ant pans
Favourable temperature for rearing is 28+/-2 degree centigrade and Relative humidity, 75% +/- 5%





The moth starts emerging on 40th day
Bring the boxes ready for moth emergence and collect moths inside the net by glass tubes
Transfer the moths to egg laying chamber
Provide cotton soaked 20% honey+ vitamin E solution as adult food in the egg laying chamber
Collect the eggs daily





Pour the eggs in a paper by tilting slightly downward so eggs come down side where as dust particles remain in upper side
Clean the eggs further by passing through different size sieves to 10, 15 and 40 meshes
Discard the moth after 4 days
Utilize the Corcyra eggs for Trichogramma production (or) host culture or store them in refrigerator at 10 degree centigrade for 7 days, if required.



Mass production of Trichogramma

Materials required

 




Corcyra eggs
Nucleus culture of Trichogramma
Polythene bags
Rubber bands
Scissors
Gum
Brush




Tea strainer
Tricho cards
50% honey solution
Stapler
Refrigerator
UV lamp

Methodology



Clean fresh Corcyra eggs by passing through 15, 30 and 45 mesh sieves. Prepare “Trichocard” by cutting card board sheet to the size of 10 x10 cm which can accommodate 1 cc of eggs. Apply gum on the card and sprinkle the cleaned eggs uniformly. Remove the excess eggs from the cards by using brush. Allow the card for shade drying for 30 minutes. Treat the eggs under UV lamp for 30 minutes. Take polythene bag, insert UV treated “Trichocard” and nucleus card at the ratio of 6:1 (6 Corcyra egg cards: 1 Trichogramma nucleus card) and provide 50% honey vitamin E in a soaked cotton swab. Remove the Tricho cards after 2 days Corcyra eggs changes black colour on 3rd day indicates the parasitization of eggs. Release the parasitized egg cards immediately in the fields (or) store them in refrigerator at 10 degree centigrade up to 21 days. Place/tie/staple parasitized cards on leaf sheath of plant.
