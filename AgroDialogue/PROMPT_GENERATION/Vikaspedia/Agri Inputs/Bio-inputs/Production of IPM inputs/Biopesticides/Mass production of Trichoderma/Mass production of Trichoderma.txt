Mass production of Trichoderma

Materials required
Rice/Wheat/ Sorghum/ Maize
Mother Culture (may be procured from CIPMCs or Statebiocontrol laboratory)
8" x 12 " plastic bag
Cotton
Rubber band
Plastic pipe of 1 1⁄2 inch length and 1 1⁄2 cm – 2 cm diameterhaving both side open (or even a bamboo of same size anddiameter, can be used removing the internodes)
Pressure cooker of 5 Lts. or above
Heating system (gas/electric heater)
Stone/wood
Fresh Water
Candle
Spoon

Methodology
Take 200g of Rice/Wheat/Jower/Maize in the poly pack and add 200 ml of fresh water in the pack (if grains contain dust then wash it twice before adding fresh water). Place the plastic pipe/Bamboo in the middle of the plastic pack (opening end) in such a way that level of the pipe and plastic remain equal. Tie it with the help of rubber band. Plug the opening end of the pipe tightly with the help of the cotton. Cover the cotton plug with a paper using rubber band. Place the thick paper inside the pressure cooker surrounding the cooker wall. Place the stone/wood in the cooker and add water into the cooker just below the stone/wood. Place the plastic pack inside the cooker and put it on heating system. Wait until 3 times gas release from the cooker (3 whistles). Remove the packet from the cooker until totally cool down.

Inoculation method
Place a candle at the corner of the room and wait for 3-4 min. Wash hand and the spoon with Dettol. Open the paper cover from the plastic pack. Take mother culture (Talc based) by using opposite end of the spoon and pour it in to the plastic pack, removing cotton plug in front of candle. Plug it again and keep the plastic pack in room temperature for 10-12 days. The entire grain based medium will turn green due to sporulation of Trichoderma

Precautions
Do not open the cotton plug until use.
Keep it in a cold place (refrigerator preferably after sporulation)
Avoid direct sunlight until use
