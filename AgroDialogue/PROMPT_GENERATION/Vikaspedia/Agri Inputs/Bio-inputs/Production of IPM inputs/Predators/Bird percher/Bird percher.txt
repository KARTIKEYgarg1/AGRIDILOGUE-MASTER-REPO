Bird percher
Bird perchers are resting places for predatory birds to rest and to look for preys; such as insect pests of cotton, peanuts, and cowpeas. Predatory birds prefer to look for prey in field crops where they have places to rest.

Materials required
Bamboo poles or wooden poles, nails, rope, grease 

Methodology
Use hollow bamboo or wooden poles for making the bird perches. Make a window slit near to upper node of the bamboo. Collect egg mass from the fields and put inside slit least part of the leaf. Provide resting place for the birds on the bamboo pole. Apply grease around the slit so that the birds sitting can predate upon the emerged larvae. Once the birds are on the field, they prey on cotton bollworms and other insects
