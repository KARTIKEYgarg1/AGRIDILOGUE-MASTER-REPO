Economics of freshwater pearl culture

Economics of freshwater pearl culture

Points to be considered:

The following projections are based only on the experimental results obtained at cifa.
The design or image pearl is an old concept, however, the array of design pearls produced at cifa are having considerable fancy value in the context of huge imports of chinese semi-cultured, 'rice pearls' in the domestic market. 
The variable charges like consultancy and marketing are not included in the calculations.
