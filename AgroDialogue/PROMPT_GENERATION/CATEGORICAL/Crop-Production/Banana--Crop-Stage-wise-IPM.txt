Banana: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre planting*

Nutrients
• banana requires high amount of nutrients, which needs to be supplied in the form of manures and fertilizers. • nutrients should be supplied on the basis of soil test report and recommendations. • generally banana crop requires 7-8 kg n, 0.7- 1.5 kg p and 17-20 kg k per metric ton yield. • in acidic soils, use dolomite (mg2co3) or limestone (caco3) as soil amendments.

Weeds

Nematodes**, banana corm weevil and diseases
Cultural control: • deep ploughing during summer • use of disease free planting material. • storage of large corms in the sun for two weeks prior to planting. • select healthy suckers. • avoid growing robusta, karpooruvally, malbhog, champa and adukkar. • grow less susceptible varieties like poovan, kadali, kunnan, poomkalli. • intercropping of banana with crotalaria juncea, marigold reduces burrowing nematodes chemical control: • before planting, the suckers should be dipped in carbofuran 3% cg @ 33g/ sucker then shade dry for 72 hrs then go for planting for rhizome weevil. • for nematode treat the suckers with carbofuran 3% cg @ 50g/suckers.

Planting*

Nutrients
• at the time of planting, apply 10 kg fym, 200 – 250 g n; 60-70 g p; 300 g k/ plant. • further application of 100 g potash and also 40 g of phosphorus are essential and applied at planting. Application of full dose of p and k at planting and n in three equal doses in shallow rings about 8-10 cm deep are recommended.

Weeds
Cultural control: • use weed free suckers for planting. • adopt intercropping of recommended crops (e.g. Cowpea etc.) with recommended agronomic practices. Chemical control: • pre-emergence application of diuron 80% wp@ 0.8 kg in 250 l of water/acre if infestation by the weed species as recommended by cibrc.

Nematodes**, banana rhizome weevil and diseases
Cultural control: • use of cover crop calopogonium. • crop rotation with non-host crops. Chemical control: • before planting, the suckers should be dipped in carbofuran 3% cg @ 33g/ sucker then shade dry for 72 hrs then go for planting for rhizome weevil. For nematode treat the seed with carbofuran 3% cg @ 50g/suckers.

Vegetative stage

Nutrients
• the application of 25 % n in organic form, 75 % n in inorganic form along with growing green manure crops is found to be beneficial. • application of 25% n as farmyard manure and 1 kg. Neem cake is beneficial. • apply 100 g of n/plant as top dressing in three equal split doses 60, 90 and 120 days after planting. • in acidic soils, triple superphosphate or diammonium phosphate is recommended. • application of 100 g k in two splits during vegetative phase should be done. • application of 200-300 g k2o is recommended depending upon the cultivar. • muriate of potash is generally used as a source of k. But in soils with ph above 7.5, potassium sulphate is advantageous. • micronutrients: combined foliar application of znso4 (0.5%), feso4 (0.2%), cuso4 (0.2%) and h3bo3 (0.1%) applied at 3, 5 and 7 months after planting helps to increase yield and quality of banana. • fertigation: in order to avoid loss of nutrients from conventional fertilizers i.e. Loss of n through leaching, volatilization, evaporation and loss of p and k by fixation in the soil, application of water soluble or liquid fertilizers through drip irrigation (fertigation) should be adopted.

Weeds
Cultural control: • collect and destroy egg masses and caterpillars • use burning torch to kill the congregating larvae • summer ploughing to expose to the pupae. • grow repellant plants: ocimum/basil • attractant plants: carrot family, sunflower family, buckwheat, alfalfa, corn, shrubs (minute pirate bug &amp; lacewing) • nectar rich plants with small flowers i.e anise, caraway, dill, parsley, mustard, sunflower, buckwheat and cowpea (braconid wasp) mechanical control: • hand pick and destroy the egg masses and caterpillars • collect and destroy the damaged plant parts. • use pheromone @ 4-5 traps/acre. • use light trap to attract and kill the adults. Biological control: • field release of egg parasitoids such as telenomus spodopterae, t. Remus • encourage the activity of larval parasitoids ichneumon promissorius, carcelia spp., campoletis chlorideae • pupal parasitoids such as ichneumon sp etc. • predators such as chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi, coccinellids, king crow, braconid wasp, dragonfly, spider, robber fly, reduviid bug, praying mantis, red ants • conserve nematode such as ovomermis albicans

Weeds
• same cultural practices as in vegetative stage. • left over weeds before shading of seeds should be removed to reduce the weed seed bank/spread.

Banana stem weevil
Cultural control: • remove dried leaves periodically and keep the fi eld clean • prune the side suckers every month • use healthy and pest free suckers to check the pest incidence • do not dump infested materials into manure pit • uproot infested trees, chop into pieces and burn • use longitudinally split pseudostem trap at 26/acre. • 2ml at 45 cm from ground level; another 2m at 150 cm from ground level. • uproot infested trees, chop into pieces and burn.

Post harvest

Anthracnose
• same as in vegetative stage

Note: the pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on high volume sprayer. * apply trichoderma viride/harzianum and pseudomonas fluorescens as rhizome, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required). ** pests of regional significance

Management of regional pests

Fruit fly:

Grow less susceptible variety
Create physical barrier between the host fruits and the egg-laying female fruit fly can be provided by bagging or rapping the fruits before maturity. Bags can be made from double layers of newspaper or brown paper.
The whole fruit bunches may be bagged inside banana leaves at later stage.
The collection and destruction of fallen, damaged and overripe fruits is strongly recommended to reduce the resident population of fruit flies. 
Fruit fly trap can be erected at every 20 meter distance.
Early harvesting may also reduce the fruit infestation and damage.

Bag worm:

The sanitary measures like hand picking and destroying the infested leaf parts should be adopted.

Fingertip or black tip rots:

Wrap the banana fruit bunch in plastic bag prior to hot water dip.
