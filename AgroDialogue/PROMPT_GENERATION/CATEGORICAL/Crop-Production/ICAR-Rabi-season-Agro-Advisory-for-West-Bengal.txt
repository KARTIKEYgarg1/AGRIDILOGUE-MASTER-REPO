Horticultural crops

Vegetables

For the coming rabi season, the better vegetable crop choice would be tomato, chilli, bitter gourd, french bean and dolichos bean for the land embankment system. For upland situation, cabbage, cauliflower, knolkhol, brinjal, beet, carrot and radish are suggested.
For the yaas affected saline lands, the salt tolerant crops like bitter gourd, ash gourd, beet, tomato, palak, cabbage, cauliflower, knolkhol and dolichos bean would be best choice.
Dolichos bean may be a good choice, as it has long cropping period. The crop must be sown by may-june and it needs harvesting and marketing of produce from october onward upto february-march.
In each case seed priming using chlormequat chloride (cycocel) @ 50 ppm for 8 hrs or 1% solution of kno3 (prepare a solution of soluble fertilizer 13:0:45 @ 10g/lt) for 1-2 hour is advised for better germination, seedling vigour and developing crop resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses.
To increase net return, input cost must be minimized. Use of homemade manure (organic manure), neem pesticide and bio-fungicide (trichoderma) will not only minimize cost of cultivation, but also will help to have better crop stand and better production.
To get healthy crop with more self-defense against pests and diseases, use as much organic manure as possible (minimum 1q /cottah). Minimize dependence on inorganic fertilizers.
Before land preparation, apply lime @ 2 kg/cottah, which will minimize soil borne disease problem maintain soil ph and enrich soil ca content.
For healthy seedling growth of each vegetable, spray soluble fertilizer 12:61:0 @ 3g/lt upon 12-15 days old seedlings. Repeat after 7 days.
Use the same fertilizer solution (12:61:0 @ 3g/lt) at the root zone, immediately after transplanting of seedlings of tomato, chilli, cole vegetables etc. Repeat the same at 2 – 3 days interval.
For better nutrient management of vegetable crops, use soluble fertilizers like 19:19:19 or 20:20:20 @ 3 to 5g/lt as much as possible at 7 – 10 days interval.
For better growth and yield in vegetable crops, micronutrient plays a vital role. For better micronutrient management, apply mixed micronutrient (grade 5) @ 1.5 to 2 g/lt as spray at 15 to 20 days interval.
To increase plant defence against biotic and abiotic stresses, use soluble fertilizer 13:0:45 @ 3 to 5 g/lt starting from flowering to fruiting stage, regularly at 15 to 20 days interval.
To increase female flower count as well as yield in cucurbit vegetables (like bitter gourd, cucumber), spray ethrel (or ethepon 39.5% sl) @ 0.4 ml/lt twice at 2 and 4 true leaf stage.
To improve fruit setting and to minimize flower or immature fruit drop in tomato, chilli, brinjal, dolichos bean, cowpea, cucurbits spray soluble b (boron 20%) @ 1.5g/lt and naa 4.5% w/w (planofix) @ 0.2 ml/lt, alternately at 10-12 days interval.

Mango, guava & litchi

Fruit drops in all the three crops can be managed by spray of naa 4.5% w/w (planofix) @ 0.3 ml/lt at 10-12 days interval.
For better fruit development, spray n-triacontanol (miraculan) @ 0.5 ml/lt at 15 days interval.
Keep sufficient moisture in the orchard basin. Mulching with straw or grass may be practiced for better soil moisture conservation.
Apply one third dose of recommended fertilizers and manures beneath the tree canopy area, during october and again in february.
In litchi, to prevent fruit cracking, maintain sufficient moisture during hot summer of may. Regular watering is compulsory. Mulching with straw or grass around the tree basin is helpful for better soil moisture conservation. Fresh water spray upon the fruits and leaves during daytime in hot &amp; dry periods may also be helpful.
In guava, individual fruit wrapping is a must to avoid fruit fly attack, as well as to get good appearance of the fruits. Wrapping should be done with transparent polythene packets with a paper piece inside it to protect the fruit from direct sunlight.
Manures and fertilizers should be applied as per recommendation. For better fruit colour and quality, apply amonium sulphate instead of urea as nitrogenous fertilizer.
For better fruit growth, soluble fertilizers like 19:19:19 or 20:20:20 @ 3 to 5g/lt and any mixed micronutrient (grade 5) @ 1.5 to 2 g/lt may be applied at 10-12 days interval.

Betelvine

To protect the plant from cold injury, use plastic sheet protection towards north &amp; west sides of the boroz.
Use 75% shade net as roofing. This will protect fog penetration and there by minimize ‘hemchiti’
Avoid applying urea or other nitrogen fertilizer indiscriminately which may make the plant more susceptible to winter injury. 
Use as much organic manure as possible.
Spray 13:0:45 @ 3g/lt. At 7-10 days interval. This will increase plants own defense against disorders. 

Animal house under loose housing system needs attention to protect them from cold stress.
Supply extra heat for newborn for preventing pneumonia and diarrhoea.
Maintaining proper cleaning and ventilation under the shade.
Dry cleaning should be followed.
Arrangement of sufficient sun light during daytime.
Provision of bedding and extra heat for preventing cold.
Lukewarm and outdoor feeding should be advised.
Maintaining body temperature feed like oilcakes and jaggery may be used.
Feed more roughage (hay &amp; straw).
Newborn should be feed with more milk.
Drainage system should be clean for preventing food root.
Promotion of fodder cultivation (oats, berseem, mustard cabbage).
Deworming the animals.
Don’t shear wools and hairs during rabi.
Additional feed is required for sheep and goat.
At least 4 hours’ sunlight is required for sheep and goat.
Use cypermethrin for removing ticks and mites inside the shades and use ivermectin for removing ecto and endo parasitic load.
Avoid over feeding.
Vaccinate fmd, hs &amp; bq for cattle, ppr for goat pox and ranikhet for poultry, duck plague for duck, swine fever for pigs.
For preventing winter stress, gunny bags should be hanged at the places from where cold air entered.
Around 6 inches of litter is needed in houses during winter.
24 hours lighting provision inside the poultry shade.
Numbers of feeder should be increased.
Continuous supply of fresh and clean lukewarm water inside the poultry shade.
Routine inspection of pipeline.
Provision of heater inside the poultry shade.

Fisheries

The feed cost in fish cultivation is about 60-70% of total expenditure. Thus, preparation of feed from low cost easily available local ingredients can reduce the expenditure and increase the profit.
During winter, most of the fishes need to sell and dry the pond by removing the water for pond management.
The stocking density about to 20% during winter period improves the fish cultivation.
In feed mill, ensure that the workers are following industry best practices, along with strict protocols of hygiene and physical sanitation regarding covid-19.
During winters, various fungal, bacterial, and parasitic diseases like fin rot, gill rot, eus and argulosis may appear in the fish. Treat the pond with cifax @ 400 ml/acre just before the onset of winters. Also treat the pond with potassium permanganate @ 1-2 kg/acre or limestone @ 50-100 kg/acre. Salt application @ 100 kg/acre also helps in protecting fish against disease outbreak during winters.
