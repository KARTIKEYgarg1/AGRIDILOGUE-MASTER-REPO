Potato: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre sowing*

Common cultural practices: • summer deep ploughing • soil solarization during summer. • field sanitation, rogueing. • avoid water logged conditions in the field. • follow crop rotation. • apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations • start to grow ecological engineering plants. • sow/plant 4 rows of maize, sorghum, bajra (pearl millet) around the potato crop field as a guard/barrier crop.

Nutrient
• apply fym @ 8 t/acre or vermicompost @ 4-6 t/acre • apply 2 kg each of azospirillum and phosphobacterium with 10 kg fym /acre as soil application before planting

Weed
• stale seed bed technique before sowing. • destroy all the germinated weeds by shallow ploughing before sowing.

Soil borne pathogens, nematodes and resting stages of insect pests
Cultural control: • give light irrigation and cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing. • raise african marigold in the nursery 15 days prior to sowing against cyst nematode. • use raised seed beds of more than 35cm height (for better water drainage). Biological control: • apply neem cake@ 80 kg/acre.

Sowing*

Common cultural practices: • use resistant/tolerant varieties. • use healthy, certified and weed seed free tubers.

Nutrients
• apply 48 kg nitrogen (n), 16 kg phosphorus (p2o5) and 48 kg potassium (k2o)/acre. • apply n and k in two splits; half as basal and half as top dressing at 30 days after sowing.

Plant growth regulator (pgr)
• dipp cut pieces of tuber (seed) for 10 minutes in chlormequat chloride 50% sl @ 100 ppm solution.

Weeds
• adopt recommended agronomic practices like field preparation, time of sowing, row and plant spacing, gap filling etc. To obtain the healthy plant stand to reduce the weed menace. • if weed flora of the field is known based on previous season experience the preemergence recommended herbicide oxyflourfen 23.5% ec @170-340 ml in 200-300 l water/ acre be applied within 3-4 days after sowing. • when 5-10 % tubers are germinated, application of paraquat dichloride 24 % sl @ 200 gram a.i./acre can be used to control broadleaf, sedges and grassy weeds.

Resting stage of the diseases, black heart/ scurf
Cultural control: • tubers stored in oxygen deficient structures should not be used. Chemical control: • treat tuber with m.e.m.c. 6% fs @ 0.415 g/ kg tubers in 100 ml water for 3-5 minute or soaking potato seed tubers in streptocycline 40 to 100 ppm solution for half an hour prior to planting or with carbendazim 25%+ mancozeb 50% ws @ (1.5 + 3.0) to (1.75 + 3.5) for 10 kg seed (tuber) or with carboxin 37.5% + thiram 37.5% ds@ (1.5 + 3.0) to (1.75 + 3.5) for 10 kg seed (tuber).

Potato virus y, s, x
• same as in aphid/thrips control

Bacterial soft rot
• follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices cultural control: • physical damage must be avoided as it encourages post harvest rots.

Harvesting

Weeds
• prior to harvesting/ after harvesting left over weeds should be removed before shedding of their seeds to reduce the spread of weeds.

Potato tuber moth
Cultural control: • after harvesting, potatoes should be kept in heaps in cool places for another 10-15 days for drying and further curing of skin. Heaps 3-4 meter long, wide at the base and about 1 meter wide at the top are the best. In hills the harvested potatoes are spread in well-ventilated rooms for drying. • fresh market potatoes should be stored between 5 to 6 °c. Potatoes that are used for making chips should be stored between 7 and 10 °c. • collection of left over tubers in the field after harvesting • storage of healthy tubers in moth proof structures

Bacterial soft rot
Cultural control: • physical damage must be avoided as it encourages post-harvest rots. • before storage curing is effective and non-chemical control method can be done by exposing tubers for 5 days at 15 – 20 °c and 90 - 95% rh.

Black heart
Cultural control: • maintain cold storage at 4 °c or slightly higher. • maintain proper aeration in the storage.

Note: pesticides dosages and spray fluid volume are based on high volume sprayer. *apply trichoderma viride/harzianum and pseudomonas fluorescens for treatment of seed tubers and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required). ** pests of regional significance
