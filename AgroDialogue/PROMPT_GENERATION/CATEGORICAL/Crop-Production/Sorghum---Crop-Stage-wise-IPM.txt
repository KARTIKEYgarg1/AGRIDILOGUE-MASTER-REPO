Sorghum : crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre-sowing*

Common cultural practices: · deep summer ploughing · use resistant/tolerant varieties · follow crop rotation with non-host crops · destroy the alternate host plants · sow the ecological engineering plants · sow sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around the main crop as guard/barrier crop · soil solarization to prevent soil borne pathogens. · timely sowing should be done. · field sanitation, rogueing · destroy the alternate host plants · apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations · adoption of crop rotation common mechanical practices: · uproot and burn infected plants parts early to avoid spread of the disease. · collection and destruction of larvae.

Nutrients
· apply fym @ 5 t/ acre and incorporate in the soil 2 to 3 weeks before sowing.

Weeds
· remove existing weeds at the time of sowing. · weed species: cyperus iria, digera arvensis, convolvulus arvensis, trianthema sp.,tridax procumbens, euphorbia hirta, phyllanthus niruri are controlled by 2,4-d dimethyl amine salt 58% sl 612 ml in 200-240 l of water/acre and 2,4-d ethyl ester 38 % ec (having 2,4-d acid 34 % w/w) 400 ml in 170 l of water/acre.

Soil borne pathogens, resting stages of insects
Cultural control: · effective weed control. · trimming of bunds · early planting minimizes shoot fly, midge and ear head bug damage. · planting sunhemp as trap crop to control the pest. Biological control: · application of neem cake@ 80 kg/ acre for nematode control. · controlling adult beetles feeding on neem. · acacia like trees on field bunds by shaking trees and destroying the beetles.

Sorghum loose smut**
Cultural control: · collect smutted ear-heads in cloth bags and destroy by dipping in boiling water or bury in soil. · avoid ratooning. Chemical control: · spray thiram 75% ws @ 10-12 g/acre in 400 ml of water.

Grain smut**
Cultural control: · collect smutted ear-heads in cloth bags and destroy by dipping in boiling water. · avoid ratooning chemical control: · seed treatment with sulphur 80% wp 1.2-1.6g/kg seed in 400 ml of water.

Sowing*

Common cultural practices: · use healthy, certified and weed free seeds. · follow proper spacing · crop rotation with pulses or oilseed crops. Common mechanical practices: · after harvest, plough to remove and destroy the stubbles. · collection and destruction of white grub.

Nutrients
· apply npk fertilizers as per soil test recommendations as far as possible. If soil test recommendations are not available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 30 n, 18 p2o5, and 18 k2kg/acre. · application of bio-fertilizers: when azospirillum is used apply only 75% of recommended n for irrigated sorghum. · mix 12.5 kg of micronutrient mixture formulated with enough sand to make a total quantity of 50 kg. · basal application of 10 kg znso4/acre-1 for the deficient soils or 5 kg zn so4 acre -1 + fym for the zn deficient soils · basal application of feso4, 20 kg/acre along with 5 t/acre fym for iron deficient soils.

Weeds
· weed species: cyperus iria, digera arvensis, convolvulus arvensis, trianthema sp.,tridax procumbens, euphorbia hirta, phyllanthus niruri are controlled by2,4-d dimethyl amine salt 58% sl 612 mlin200-240 l of water/acre and 2,4-d ethyl ester 38 % ec (having 2,4-d acid 34 % w/w)400 ml in 170 l of water/acre.

Shoot fly
Cultural control: · early sowing to avoid the active period of shoot fly population. · planting date in kharif 7-10 days onset of monsoon and in rabi end of september to 1st week of october is ideal to escape the shoot fly · high seed rate 1.6 – 2.0 kg/acre. · tall variety with yellow glossy stem less attacked. Mechanical control: · removal of the seedlings with dead hearts. · set up the low cost fish meal traps @4/acre till the crop is 30 days old. Chemical control: · seed treatment with imidacloprid 48% fs @12ml/kg seeds · seed treatment with imidacloprid 70% ws@ 10g/kg seeds · spraying carbaryl 50%wp@ 600g/acre in 200-400 l of water. · soil application carbofuran 3% cg @13320g/acre. · spraying oxydemeton-methyl 25% ec @400ml/acre in 200-400 l of water. · soil application phorate 10% cg @ 7500g/acre. · spraying quinalphos 25%ec @ 600ml/acre in 200-400 l of water. · seed treatment with thiamethoxam 30% fs @ 10 ml/kgseeds.

Vegetative

Common cultural practices: · collect and destroy crop debris · collect and destroy disease infected and insect damaged plant parts · provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop · avoid water logging · avoid water stress during flowering stage · judicious use of fertilizers · enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed common mechanical practices: · collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae · handpick the older larvae during early stages · the infested shoots and seed capsules may be collected and destroyed · handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. · use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre · use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm · install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) · erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc. · set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm common biological practices: · conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering · augmentative release of natural enemies

Nutrients
· apply n @ 50:25:25 % at 0, 15 and 30 das and full dose of p2o5 and k2o basally before sowing and if basal application is not possible the same could be top dressed within 24 hours.
