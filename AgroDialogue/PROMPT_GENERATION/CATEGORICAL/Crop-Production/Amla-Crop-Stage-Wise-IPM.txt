Amla crop stage wise ipm

Managementactivity

Pre-planting

Common cultural practices:

 timely planting should be done.
Field sanitation, roguing

 destroy the alternate host plants

Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations

Sow the ecological engineering plants

Sow the intercrops as per the season.

Sow/plant sorghum/maize/pearl millet in 4 rows all around the crops as a guard/barrier crop.

Nutrients 

Apply 4 tonnes of well decomposed farm yard manure per acre
Apply 90:120:48 of npk along with elemental sulphur 10 kg and micro nutrients 10 kg per acre. 
15 kg of fym and 0.5 kg of phosphorus should be applied to each pit before planting.

Weeds

Regular weeding should be done

Resting stages of soil borne pathogens, pests

Cultural control:

Deep summer ploughing of fields to control soil borne pathogens and subsequently reduces their initial population build up.

Soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil-borne pests including weeds.

Planting

Common cultural practices:

Use resistant/tolerant planting material/seedlings 
Follow proper plant spacing
Use healthy, certified and weed free planting material.

Nutrients

Application of nitrogen 30 g/tree of each year during september â€“ october up to 10 years. 
The young plants should be given 15-20 kg of well rotten fym and the mature trees should be given 1 kg of super phosphate and 1-1.5kg of muriate of potash 
The above fertilizers should be given in two split doses to mature, bearing tree, once during september-october and during april-may. 

 after setting of the fruits the plants needs to be irrigated after fertilizer application.

Weeds

Same as in pre planting stage

Resting stages of soil borne pathogens, pests

Same as in pre planting stage

Note: apply trichoderma viride/ harzianum and pseudomonas fluorescens as seed/seedling/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required)

Vegetative stage

Common cultural practices:

Collect and destroy crop debris 
Provide irrigation at the critical stages of the crop 
Avoid water logging 
Avoid water stress during flowering stage 
Follow judicious use of fertilizers 
Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical pesticide spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed in the crops field.

Common mechanical practices:

Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant parts. 
Collect and destroy eggs and early stage larvae 
Handpick the older larvae during early stages 
Hand pick the gregarious caterpillars and cocoons which are found on stem/branches and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. 
Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre 
Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm 
Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) 
Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc. 
Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm
Common biological practices:

Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 

 augmentative release of natural enemies

Nutrient

As indicated during planting stage.

Weeds

Same as indicated during pre planting stage

Bark eating caterpillar

Cultural control:

Keep orchard clean by proper sanitation. 
Detect early infestation by periodically looking out for drying young shoots. 
Collect loose and damaged bark &amp; destroy. 

 kill larvae by inserting iron spike or wire into hole

Apical twig gall maker

Cultural control:

Adopt training and pruning to discourage overcrowding of branches. 

 galled shoots should be pruned and destroyed along with the pest after harvest

Aphids

Cultural control: 

Clipping off and destruction of affected leaf and shoot. 
Collect and destroy alternate weed hosts. 
Eract yellow pan traps @ 4-5 trap/acre
Biological control:
Scymnus, chilomens sexmaculatus, chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi and other coccinellids, predatory mantids, green lace wings, ladybird beetles and parasitic wasps

Mealy bug

Cultural control 

Follow clean cultivation and maintenance of health and vigour of the tree. 

Prune affected parts and destroy them at early stages of infestation. 
Early detection of mealy bugs - presence of ants - indicator 
Cutting of infested twigs and leaves and burying them

 biological control: 

Field release of green lace wing chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi 
Several species of ladybird beetles such as chilocorus sp. And cryptolaemus montrouzieri are efficient predator.

Pomegranate butterfly

Cultural control:

Clean cultivation and maintenance of health and vigour of the tree should be followed. 
Infested fruits should be identified, collected and destroyed to prevent further spread of infestation.

Mechanical control:

Remove weeds of compositae family 
Detect early infestation by periodically looking for drying branches.

 biological control: 

Release of trichogramma chilonis @ 1.0 lakhs/ acre four times at 10 days interval.

White fly

Cultural control: 

Clipping of and destruction of infested leaves. 
Avoid water stress and water log conditions.
Avoid planting in low land areas.

Mechanical control:

Remove the puparia bearing leaves and immediately disposing by burning or burying to prevent emergence of adult white flies 
Use yellow sticky traps.

Biological control:

Release parasitoids encarsia sp, eretmocerus sp.

Release predators dicyphus hesperus (mirid bug), dragonfly, spider, robber fly, praying mantis, fire ants, coccinellids, lace wings, big eyed bugs (geocoris spp.) etc 

Leaf miner

Cultural control:

Avoid pruning live branches more than once a year, so that the cycles of flushing are uniform and short. 
Do not apply nitrogen fertilizer at the times of the year when leaf miner populations are high and flush growth will be severely damaged.. 

Set up yellow pan water trap/sticky traps 15 cm above the canopy for monitoring and management of leaf minor @ 8-10 traps/acre.

Biological control:

Release natural enemies wasp like pnigalio spp and closterocerus spp.

Hairy caterpillars and leaf roller

Cultural control:

Hand pick caterpillars and destroy the infest plant parts along with larva. 

Rust

Cultural control: 

Grow tolerant/resistant cultivars like banarasi and chakaiya.

Maintain proper plant distance and aeration by training and pruning. 

 severely infected plant parts should be pruned and destroyed
