 passion fruit - crop stage wise ipm

 management activity

Nursery management

Seed should be sown in well prepared seed bed or in polybag with a mixture of soil, compost and sand (2:1:1).

Root rot and crown rot

Cultural control:

 the elimination of diseased tissues during the initial stages of the disease. 
 proper drainage system to remove excess water

Soil borne diseases, insect pests

Common cultural practices:

 summer deep ploughing to expose soil inhabiting/resting stage of various insects/pathogens. 
 trimming of all orchard bunds to destroy existing rodent burrow. 
Use tolerant/resistant varieties
 apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. 
 grow tall barrier crops like maize, sorghum etc. For management of aphids.

Common mechanical practices:

 uproot and burn infected plants parts early to avoid spread of the disease. 
Collection and destruction of larvae.

Nutrients

Nutrients should be applied based on soil test report and recommendation of the particular agroclimatic zone.

 soil should be rich in organic matter. If required, add farm yard manure or vermicompost.

Weeds

 deep ploughing during summer
 ploughing the orchard before planting to destroy existing weeds in the orchard.

Planting

Nutrient management

 apply mycorrhizae @ 5 to 10 g in each pit. Apply nutrients as mentioned above.

Weed management

 use weed free planting material. 
 remove all existing weeds from pits or furrows at the time of planting.
Seasonal vegetables (e.g. Turmeric, ginger, chilli, soybean, beans, pea, green leafy vegetables, mustard etc) may be grown as intercrop right from the first year.

Vegetative

Common cultural practices:

 destroy crop debris. 
 provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop 
 enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed 

Common mechanical practices:

 collection and destruction of rotten fruits, twigs and leaves. 
 the trellis should always run across the slop or in north south direction for proper exposure to sunlight. 
 pruning should be restricted to lower part of the vines hanging on the ground during winter when vines are dormant.
 use yellow sticky traps for whitefly and aphids and blue sticky trap for thrips @ 4-5 trap/acre. 

Common biological practices:

 conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering.
Augmentative release of natural enemies.

Nutrients

 apply as mentioned above

Weeds

 weed control should be done manually or mechanically. Care should be taken to avoid the damage to shallow roots of the vines
 mulching of plants around the root zone to conserve the moisture and fertility of soil.

Mites

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 

Cultural control:

Periodic inspections of the orchard and other adjacent hosts, including weeds, are essential to verify the occurrence and first symptoms of mite attacks.
 see common cultural practices.

Biological control:

Spray neem or pongamia soap at 1% on lower surface thoroughly

Aphids

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 

Cultural control:

High levels of nitrogen fertilizer favor aphid reproduction, so never use more nitrogen than necessary. 

Biological control:

 release 1st instar larvae of green lacewing (chrysoperla zastrowii sillemi) @ 4,000 nos/acre.
Spraying with tobacco decoction (1 kg tobacco boiled in 10 lit of water for 30 minutes and making up to 30 lit + 100 g soap).

Mealybugs

Follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 

Cultural control:

 prune affected shoots during winter. 
 destroy ant colonies. 
 grow attractant plants to attract the defenders bachelor's buttons or cornflower (centaure acyanus), coriander attract wasps. 

Mechanical control:

Collect and destroy the damaged leaves, twigs and stems 
 use sticky barrier (5cm length) on trunk. 
Biological control:
 orchard release of australian lady bird beetle (cryptolaemus montrouzieri) @10 beetles per plant.

Scales

Follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices

Biological control:

 when infestation in serious, two sprays of white oil, one in early december and one 4 to 6 weeks later are usually required. 
 spray horticultural oil, if needed, year round. 
Apply mixture of manure compost tea, molasses and citrus oil.
 conserve the aphytis spp.

Fusarium wilt

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 
 for resistant/tolerant varieties consult nearest kvks/saus/icar institute

Cultural control:

 planting areas previously affected may be avoided.
 use of healthy seedlings and careful control of weeds to avoid root injury can check the spread of disease. 
Usage of resistant root stocks or resistant hybrids from crosses between purple and yellow passion fruits.

Root and crown rot

Follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 
For resistant/tolerant varieties consult nearest kvks/saus/icar institute

Anthracnose

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices
 for resistant/tolerant varieties consult nearest kvks/saus/icar institute

Mechanical control:

 pruning to eliminate affected areas and improve ventilation and light conditions helps to control the disease.
Fruit should not be harvested during wet conditions.

Scab

Cultural control:

High densities of seedlings have to be avoided in plant nurseries, as well as excessive irrigation.
Follow the common cultural practices.

Septoria blotch/spot

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 
 for resistant/tolerant varieties consult nearest kvks/saus/icar institute

Brown spot

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 
 for resistant/tolerant varieties consult nearest kvks/saus/icar institute

Woodiness virus

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 
 for resistant/tolerant varieties consult nearest kvks/saus/icar institute

Reproductive

Nutrients

Zinc and boron are the micro-nutrients taken up in largest amounts by the plant. With zn deficiency, apply 20 g of zinc sulphate (znso4) per plant, and of b, apply 6.5 g of boric acid (h3bo3) per plant

Weed

Remove weeds manually or mechanically around the plants. 
Apply the bio-mulch around the root zone of the plants.

Fruit fly

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices (see page no 24 &amp; 25 )

Mechanical control:

 elimination of over-ripe fruits in which the flies breed and on which the adults feed. 
Removal of wild host plant.
 installation of 10 traps/ha to monitor fruit fly. Hanging of bottle traps containing 100 ml of water emulsion of methyl eugenol (0.1%) + malathion (0.1%) during fruiting season.

Mealy bugs,scales, aphids and mites

 follow practices mentioned in vegetative stage

For diseases

Same as in vegetative stage.
