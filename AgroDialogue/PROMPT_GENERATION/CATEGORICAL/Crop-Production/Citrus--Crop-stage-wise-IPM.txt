Citrus: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre planting*

Nutrients
• pits of 1 metre cube are dug in square system during summer season and kept open for controlling soil borne pests.

Weeds
• deep ploughing before establishment of orchards • remove the weeds mechanically.

Pests, nematode and soil borne pathogens
• deep summer ploughing of fields to control nematodes and soil borne diseases • use of resistant / tolerant varieties

Planting *

Nutrients
• pits should be filled with a mixture of pond silt, red soil and fym. • two- three kg of bone meal or single super phosphate per pit should be applied.

Weeds
• inter-cropping • inter culture operation and hand weeding • where mechanical removal is not possible apply 2,4-d sodium salt technical (having 2,4-d acid 80 % w/w) (earlier registered as 80% wp) 0.5-1.28 kg in 240 l of water/acre or apply diuron 80% wp @ 1-2 kg in 240 l of the water/acre (only for sweet orange) for control of weeds such as cyperus iria, tribulus terrestris, digera arvensis, commelinanudiflora.

Vegetative growth stage * (1-5 years)

Nutrients
• nitrogen is applied in the form of fym and oil cakes each at 25% and the remaining 50% with chemical fertilizers, while, p2o5 in the form of super phosphate and k2o in the form of muriate of potash. • manures are applied in 2 to 3 equal doses ie. First dose in december-january, 2nd dose in june-july, 3rd dose in september. Potash application can be reduced if the soil is rich in this nutrient. • nitrogen containing fertilizers should be applied in three equal splits in january, july and november; phosphorus containing fertilizers in two splits in january and july and potassium containing fertilizers may be applied as single dose in january. • adopt ring method of fertilizer application. • a mixture of zinc sulphate 0.5%, manganese sulphate 0.2%, boric acid 0.1%, urea 1% and lime 0.4% has to be sprayed two or three times in a year to control chlorosis in leaves. • intercrops during pre-bearing period short growing crops like groundnut, ragi, bajra wheat and vegetables (except solanaceous crops) can be profitably grown in the inter spaces. • in the bearing orchards, raise green manure crops like sunhemp, green gram, cowpea etc and incorporate into the soil during the monsoon period. 

Vegetative growth stage (1-5 years)

Weeds
• timely interculturing and hand weeding should be done. • mulching - after weeding and manuring, apply dry-leaf mulch or paddy husk to a thickness of 8 cm in the basin. • inter-cultivation - shallow ploughing or light hand digging should be done during monsoon season. The soil in the basin is likely to become hard under continuous irrigation and therefore it should be given a light hand-digging with spade after every three irrigations so as to maintain porosity and tilth. Under no circumstances should weeds be allowed to grow rampant in the orchard.

Fruiting stage (5-20 years)

Weeds
• cultural operations same as in vegetative stage.

Citrus blackfly**
Mechanical control: • collect and destroy the damaged plant parts along with nymphs, pupa and adults. • use light trap (wavelength of 550 nm) • yellow sticky traps or cards reduce the density of black flies biological control: • pupal parasitoids: encarsia formosa, eretmocerus spp • predators: chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi, coccinellids, spiders.

Mealybug
Cultural control: • prune affected shoots during winter. • destroy ant colonies. • grow attractant plants to attract the defenders • bachelor’s buttons or cornflower (centaure acyanus), coriander attract wasps. Mechanical control: • collect and destroy the damaged leaves, twigs and stems • use sticky barrier (5cm length) on trunk biological control: • field release of australian ladybird beetle (cryptolaemus montrouzieri) @10 beetles per tree.

Citrus tristeza disease
Cultural control: • use certified budwood free of ctv • remove all diseased trees as and when the disease is noticed. Fresh plantings to be taken with virus free materials on tolerant rootstocks. For sweet orange and mandarin avoid susceptible rootstocks. Chemical control: • for acid lime, use seedling immunised with mild strain of citrus tristeza virus (cross protection). • periodic sprays of insecticides like monochrotophos 0.05 % controls the population of citrus aphids that reduces secondary spread of the disease in the orchard. • copper oxy chloride 50% wp @ 1 kg in 300-400 l of water/acre

Chemical control: • aureofungin 46.15% w/v. Sp @ 300 (1%) gm /ml/acre.

Powdery mildew**
Cultural control: • nitrogen fertilizers encourage dense leafy growth, nitrogen should be applied at precise rates, less than 0.03175 metric per acre, to decrease severity. Chemical control: • sulphur 80% wp @ 1252 g in 300-400 l of water/acre

Greening
Cultural control: • selection of proper site with adequate drainage and high budding (30 to 46 cm or above). • provision of an inner ring about 45 cm around the tree trunk to prevent moist soil. (double ring method of irrigation) • avoid irrigation water from coming in direct contact with the tree trunk. • avoid injuries to crown roots or base of stem during cultural operations. • use resistant sour orange rootstocks for propagating economic varieties • use certified pathogen free bud wood for propagation. Chemical control: • control psyllids with insecticides like dimethoate or imidacloprid • applying bordeaux paste or znso4, cuso4, lime (5:1:4) to a height of about 60 cm above the ground level at least once a year.

Note: the pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on high volume spray.

* apply trichoderma spp. And pseudomonas fluorescens as seed/seedling/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).
