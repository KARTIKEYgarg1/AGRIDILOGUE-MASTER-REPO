Nutritional deficiencies of mango

Potassium

Symptoms

Scorching of leaf margins is the characteristic symptom of potassium deficiency.
Scorching starts from tip downwards. Fruit quality is reduced. Trees with potassium deficiency are easily prone to pest and disease attack.

Management

Application of 1 kg muriate of potash or sulphate of potash along with 2 kg urea and 6 kg super phosphate during july-august in the basin could rectify potassium deficiency.
Dropped leaves should also be incorporated along with manures to enrich the soil health and fertility.

Zinc

Symptoms

The leaves become small and narrow with leaf margins bent upward or downward. Inter nodal length is reduced drastically and the twig with crowded leaves gives rosette appearance.
Pale inferential areas and green veins are typical of zinc deficient leaves.
The tree with zinc hunger does not grow well and the yield, size and quality of the fruit are reduced.
Small plants with severe zinc deficiency may die.
Zinc deficiency is conspicuously seen in alkaline, saline and sandy soils

Management

Zinc deficiency can be rectified by spraying of zinc sulphate 5 g +10g urea /1water twice at 15 days interval.

Iron

Symptoms

The leaves loose green colour and turn white and is called “bleaching”.
The size of the leaf is reduced. In severe cases of iron deficiency, the leaves dry from tip downwards.
The deficiency is common in soils with high calcium content. Hence, the effect is known as “calcium induced iron chlorosis”.

Management

Two sprays at fortnight interval with ferrous sulphate 2.5 g per liter.

Boron

Symptoms

Cracking of fruit is the characteristic symptom of boron deficiency.
Lusterless leathery leaves with thickened veins are the other associated symptoms.
Brown areas in yellow fruit pulp are conspicuous.

Management

Application of 250gm boron per tree (10-15 year old) with recommended dose of manures during july-august.

Salt injury / toxicity

Symptoms

The leaves are scorched due to excess salt in soil or irrigation water. The leaves lose their natural colour and turn to bronze colour.
Tip burning is also seen in severe cases of salt injury.

Management

Raise diancha as green manure crop with onset of monsoon in the inter-spaces of the orchard during tree bearing years and remove.
Farm yard manure and compost should be applied adequately every year.
Gypsum filled gunny bag if kept in flowing irrigation water will reduce salt effect.

Copper

Symptoms

Copper deficiency symptoms frequently develop on young trees which generally occur due to heavy nitrogenous fertilization.
It may also be accompanied by zinc deficiency symptoms.
The appearance of weak terminal shoots followed by defoliation and die back of branches, on the top of long drooping or shaped branches of the proceeding cycle of growth usually makes evident that copper is needed.

Management

Application / spraying of copper (250 g/ 10 years tree) or copper oxychloride(0.3%) at monthly interval.
