Management
 
Activity

Pre planting

 

Common cultural practices: 

Destroy the alternate host plants 
Sow the ecological engineering plants 
Sow sorghum/maize/ pearl millet in 4 rows all around the main crop as guard/barrier crop 
Plough the field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the field.
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. 
Grow the attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the field bunds. 
Proper selection of cultivars having commercial value and suitable for effective cross pollination 
Before planting of walnut trees, the proper soil selection be made, and the most suitable soil is loam with abundant organic matter. 
Irrigate the plants i - 2 fortnights before expected harvesting. 
To avoid wilting due to long dry spell of summer irrigate the plants. 
Orchard management practices be followed strictly like clean cultivation. 
Arrangement of efficient pruning tools be made before undertaking pruning job. 
If the plants / trees exhibit the deficiency of micronutrients, especially of boron go for the application of the same on the basis of soil and leaf analysis. 
2 or 3 varieties of walnut are required to be planted for adequate pollination. 
Apply balanced dose of chemical fertilizers and fym to up keep the vigour of the plant and to reduce the attack of shot hole, back beetles and other pest. 
Growing of flowering plants, especially marigold and maize on peripheries and legumes as inter cropping help in conservation of both predators and parasitoids and helps in nematode management.

Nutrients

Nutrient should be applied on the basis of soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
Prepare land by ploughing and harrowing. 
The pits are dug in summer about a fortnight before planting and left undisturbed. 
Pits of about 1m x 1m x 1m size are dug at a distance of 10 meter in square system of planting.

Water management

Proper drainage as crop is water sensitive

Weeds

Plough the field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the field.

Apply manures @ 50kg per plant in dec-jan every year along with full dose of p and k. 
Nitrogen is applied in 2 splits, first half at 2-3 weeks before flowering and the remaining half a month later. 
The fertilizers should be applied in 20-30 cm deep and 30cms wide trench along the drip line of the tree

Weeds

Deep hoeing is recommended during the first year to check weed growth. Weeding should be done on regular basis especially around the plants. 
To suppress the weeds between rows, leguminous crops and vegetables can be grown as intercrops in the initial years. 
Use straw or plastic mulches to check the weed growth. 
Use slashing and mowing between the rows to control the weeds
