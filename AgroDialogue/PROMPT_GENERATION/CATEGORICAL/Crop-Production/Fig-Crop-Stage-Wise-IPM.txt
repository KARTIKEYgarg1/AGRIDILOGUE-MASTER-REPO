Fig crop stage-wise ipm

Management
 
Activity

Pre-sowing/pre-planting

 

Common cultural practices:

Timely planting should be done. 
Orchard sanitation 
Destroy the alternate host plants 
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations

Nutrients

Nutrient should be applied on the basis of soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
Adopt integrated nutrient management approach for supply of nutrients.
Prepare land by ploughing and harrowing. 
Fig is planted in square system of planting at a spacing of 5 m x 5 m accommodating about 160 plants per acre. Pits of 0.6 cubic m are dug for planting the cuttings. 
Fill the pits with top soil mixed with 25 kg fym treated with trichoderma.

Weeds

Deep ploughing during summer ploughing the field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the field.

Nematodes

Cultural control:

Use certified resistant planting materials 
Clean planting materials by sieving or by using 2% salt water floatation to remove galls and prevent ear cockle diseases. 
Galls can be separated by coarse sieve from the healthy planting materials
Winnowing or fanning 
Brine flotation: 2% salt solution in place of plain water removes almost 100 % galls.
Deep ploughing of orchards during summer to control nematodes, 
Soil solarization for control of soil borne pathogens and nematodes. 
Apply well rotten farm yard manure only to discourage termite infestation. 
Avoid late plantation

Planting

 

Common cultural practices:

Use healthy and certified plants 
Grow resistant/tolerant varieties. 
Irrigation should be done by ring method to reduce possibility of diseases 
Avoid growing in low-lying areas and flooding. 
Do not delay irrigation until the tree exhibits moisture stress symptoms.

Common mechanical practices:

Remove and destroy the diseased orchard.

Nutrients

Planting is done in pits already filled with top soil and farm yard manure. The planting is generally done during june to september. 
Apply 20 g each of azospirillum and mycorrhizae per plant in pits at planting

Weeds

Use weed free planting materials for planting. 
Remove weeds from the pit, if any and then plant seedlings.

Vegetative stage

 

Common cultural practices:

Intercultural and hand weeding 
Timely irrigation 
Avoid water logging 
Avoid water stress 
Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed 

Common mechanical practices:

Remove and destroy alternate wild hosts and weeds 
Use of pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre 
Installation of light trap @ 1/ acre 
Prune and burn all attacked shoot and branches.

Common biological practices:

Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies

Manures and fertilizers should be applied in 20-30 cm deep and 30cms wide trench along the drip line of the tree.

Weeds

Hoeing is recommended during the first year to check weed growth. Weeding should be done on regular basis especially around the plants.
Earthing up is done before or after the onset of monsoon to avoid water-logging and also to help the plants to stand erect. 
To suppress the weeds between rows, leguminous trees and vegetables can be grown as intercrops during initial 5 years. 
Use straw or plastic mulch to avoid weed growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period

Stem borer

Cultural control:

Remove and destroy dead and severely affected branches of tree. 
Remove alternative host like mango, moringa, silk cotton in the near vicinity. 
Avoid injury at the base of trunk while pruning 
Keep the orchard healthy following good agricultural practices. 
Kill the stem borer larvae by inserting a flexible wire inside the hole and plug the hole with the cotton wick soaked in petrol or chloroform or kerosene and seal it with mud. 

Mechanical control:

Prune and burn all attacked shoot and branches during winter. 

Biological control:

Exclude alternatives host trees, such as silk cotton, fig tree and remove the infested branches from the garden to prevent the spread of the pest. 
Use neem based biopesticide inside the hole. 
Lantana camera leaf extracts @5%

Fruit fly

Cultural control:

Tree rotation, enhancement of soil quality, choice of resistant varieties, water management, monitoring/screening, orchard sanitation, mechanical barriers, post-harvest treatment. 
Prior to harvest (30-40 days) collect and disposed off infested and fallen fruits to prevent further, multiplication and carry-over of population. 
Ploughing of orchard during november-december to expose pupae to sun’s heat which kills them. 
Infestation is high, use bait splash on the trunk only once or twice at weekly interval. To prepare bait splash, mix 100 gm of jaggery in one litre of water 
Managing fruit flies also reduces anthracnose disease and prevents late fruit fall. 

Mechanical control:

Collect and destroy the adult flies 

Biological control:

Rove beetles, weaver ants, spiders and birds and bats, 
Release of parasitoids such as opius longicaudatus, o. Vandenboschi, o. Oophilus and bracon spp

Fig midge

Cultural control:

Removal of johnson grassy weed 

Biological control:

Neem seed kernel extract 5% 
Parasitoids: aprostocetus sp.

Mealy bug

Cultural control:

Prune affected shoots during winter. 
Destroy ant colonies. 
Grow attractant plants bachelor's buttons or cornflower (centaure acyanus), coriander attract wasps. 

Mechanical control:

Collect and destroy the damaged leaves, twigs and stems 
Use sticky barrier (5cm length) on trunk 

Biological control:

Coccinellids like r. Fumida, chrysopid like chrysoperla zastrowii silemi and drosophilid like cacoxenus perspicax

Scale

Cultural control:

Collect the egg carrying female in mounds before spreading to hibernation places.

Biological control:

Coccinellids, p. Kenyae, chilocorus sp., hyperaspis, scymnus, cryptolaemus.

Leaf roller

Cultural control:

Deep ploughing and soil solaraisation before planting. 
Collect and burn all infested leaves. 

Biological control:

Conserve parasites such as apanteles angeleti, trathala flavoorbitalis and cadurcia vanderwulpi 
Conserve predators such as lacewings, assassin bugs, and minute pirate bugs.

Thrips

Cultural control:

Monitor the tree regularly. 
Adult thrips can be monitored by mass trapping with coloured (blue, yellow or white) sticky traps or water traps in the nursery or orchard. 
Ploughing and harrowing, and solarisation can kill pupae in the soil from previously infested trees. 
Inter-cropping with tomatoes may reduce the populations of thrips 

Biological control:

Various biological control agents, including minute pirate bugs, orius spp. (hemiptera: anthocoridae) and entomopathogenic nematodes, thripinema spp. (tylenchida: allantonematidae)

Coccid

Cultural control:

Sanitation is also important for reducing the pest population by disposing of fallen fruit, which may serve as hosts for the overwintering females. 
Grow attractant plants for natural enemies: viz., sunflower family, carrot family plants, buckwheat. 
Control ants and dust which can give the scale a competitive advantage 

Mechanical control:

Pruning of infested branches and twigs 
Collection and destruction of pruned infested material. 

Biological control:

Olive scale is effectively controlled by two parasites aphytis maculicornis and coccophagoides utilis. 
Parasitoids such as encarsia perniciosi and aphytis diaspidis cause effective parasitization. 
Coccinellid predators such as chilocorus infernalis, chilocorus rubidus, pharoscymnus flexibilis check the pest infestation to some extent. 
Spray dormant oil in late winter before spring. 
Apply mixture of manure compost tea, molasses and citrus oil. 
Garlic-pepper tea also helps.

Fig moth

Mechanical control:

Sieving, picking out, or winnowing,
It is important to destroy any insects found in the by-products or left-overs immediately. Larvae living inside the grain are only inadequately eliminated.

Biological control:

Larval parasitoid, habrobracon hebetor 
Pupal parasitoid, antrocephalus mitys 
Spraying neem oil.

Fig jassids

Cultural control:

Apply adequate amount of nitrogen

Rot can be minimized by picking fruit before it becomes overripe. 
Reducing dust in orchards may also help to reduce the incidence of rot

Aspergillus rot

Cultural control:

Avoid stressing trees by providing adequate irrigation. 
Reducing dust in the orchard may help to reduce incidence of rots

Smut
