Maize

Land preparation and sowing of maize may be completed from 1stweek of october using composite variety or hybrid sweet corn.
Spacing for maize may be maintained at 60x30 cm so that optimum plant population could be maintained.
Fertilizer application using fym and npk @ 120:60:40 for hybrids using one third n and full dose of p and k at sowing time and two split doses of n at first earthing up and one month thereafter should be used.
For weed control pre-emergence herbicide atrazine @ 1.5-2 kg a.i / ha for sole crops while alochlor @ 1.5 kg /ha can be used for mixed cropping systems.
In areas where cutworm and white grubs are serious pests, chlorpyriphos @ 2 litre/ha mixed in 60-70 kg sandy soil may be used for soil amendment before sowing or cypermethrin 10ec @ 1ml /litre may be used for foliar application.

Management of faw (fall army worm)

Hand picking and destruction of egg masses and larvae by crushing or immersing in kerosene water.
Application of dry sand into the whorl of affected maize plants soon after observation of faw.
Mass trapping of male moths using pheromone traps@15/acre.
Chemical management:

To control faw larvae at 5% damage to reduce hatching ability of freshly laid eggs, spray 5% nske nor azadirachtin 1500 ppm@5ml/litre of water; 
To manage 2nd and 3rd instars larvae @ 10-20% damage, spray spinetoram 11.7&amp;sc @0.5ml/litre of water;
After emergence of tasselling, hand picking of the larvae is advisable as insecticide management at this stage is not cost effective.

 of winter vegetable crops

Select a sunny area with well drained friable light soil rich in organic matter.
Nursery bed should be prepared by second week of august. Bring the soil into fine tilth and raise the bed to 10-15 cm above ground level. Mix well rotten farmyard manure/ compost or leaf compost in the soil.
To make the soil free from soil-borne disease-causing pathogens (damping-off), drench the bed with 0.1% solution of captan or fytolan.
Cover immediately with polythene sheet or gunny bag or thick paper for 2 days.
Uncover the soil and get it loosened and leave it as such for 3-4 days.
Mix malathion 5% dust thoroughly to protect the seedlings from soil-borne insects.
Sowing should be done by last week of august or first/ second week of september. Sow the seeds thinly in u-shaped furrows spaced at 2.5 cm and at a depth of 1-2 cm (4 times the diameter of the seed). Cover the seeds immediately with a thin layer of sand mixed with well dried and sieved farmyard manure.
Irrigate the sown beds using water cane fitted with a fine hose.
Seedlings are ready for transplanting 21-30 days after sowing.
Pit should be prepared and fym should be applied 15 days ahead of transplanting. Liming should be done earlier to transplanting to raise the soil ph to optimum level. Pit should be treated with insecticide before transplanting of plants. Pit should be prepared at a spacing of 75 x 30 cm (row to row x plant to plant).

Rabi vegetable crops (tomato, cabbage, broccoli, onion)

Farmers are advised to prepare nursery bed for rabi crops starting from the month end of august.
Land preparation for direct sowing of rabi crops is to be started by the month of september.
Seed treatment of rabi crops to be done with carbendazim (0.1%) 2g/kg seed and trichoderma spp. 4-6g/kg seed.
Farmers are advised to adopt sowing of leguminous crops as intercrop to increase the soil nutrient where the nutrient level of the soil are low.

Management of aphids in mustard

Set up yellow sticky trap to monitor aphid population.
Destroy the affected parts along with aphids.
Spray dimethoate @2.5ml/ litre of water.

Management of insect pests in brinjal

Collection and destruction of infected leaves along with the insects reduces pest incidence.
Spraying the crop with malathion 2ml/litre of water or carbaryl (2-4g/litre of water) effectively controls the pest.

Powdery mildew in vegetables

Combine 1 tablespoon, baking soda and one half teaspoon of liquid, non-detergent soap with one gallon of water and spray the mixture literally on the plants. Mouthwash can also be used.

Oyster mushroom cultivation

Cut straw 3-4 inches and boil it for 20-30 mins. Cool it and squeeze the wet straw to minimize moisture content. Keep it in a polythene, layer by layer. Put the spawn in each layer. Make a hole in the polythene. Incubate it in a dark room for 10-14 days. Take out the polythene and keep it in a rack and water it the next day by sprayer. Mushroom will bloom after 5-6 days and can be harvested.

Piggery

Pig farmers are suggested for regular supplementation of mineral mixture @ 20-30 g/head/day for adult pig and calcium to the lactating and pregnant sow @ 30-40 ml/head/day to maintain productivity.
As mizoram is currently facing african swine fever epidemic in many districts, the farmers are advised to regularly disinfect the farm premises and pig sty using disinfectants such as 2% sodium hydroxide, sodium, or calcium hypochlorite (2-3%) etc. Foot dip should be place at the entrance of the farm.
Pigs brought from other farm or other location should be kept in quarantine for at least 30 days before mixing with another herd. Avoid bringing of pigs from disease infected area.
If there is a suspected case of asf or sudden death of pigs in your area, immediately inform the veterinary officer for further treatment and prevention of the spread of the disease and proper disposal of diseased carcasses.
Farmers are suggested to feed their pigs with locally available non-conventional feed stuffs like kitchen waste, vegetable waste, brewery waste, nutritious plants like wild cassava, colacasia etc. May be incorporated to some extend to minimize the feed cost as well as to get rid of problem of commercial feed scarcity in piggery.
Ensure vaccination of piglets against classical swine fever disease initially at the age of 2 months (weaning) and then booster dose at 6 months after first vaccination and thereafter annually.
Pigs should be vaccinated against fmd initially at the age of 2 months and then revaccinate annually.
Pig should be de-wormed against gastro-intestinal nematode with albendazole @ 5-10 mg/kg body weight or fenbendazole @ 7.5-10 mg/kg body weight orally
