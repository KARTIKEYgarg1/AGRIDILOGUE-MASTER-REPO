Redgram: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre- sowing*

Common cultural practices: • timely sowing should be done. • field sanitation, rogueing • deep summer ploughing to control juveniles and adults of nematodes, and resting stages of insect pests. • sow the ecological engineering plants • sow/plant sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around cumin crop as a guard/barrier crop • destroy the alternate host plants • apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations • follow crop rotation with non host crops such as rice, maize, sorghum, tobacco or castor

Nutrients
• nutrients should be applied based on the soil test report and recommendations for the particular agro-climatic zone. • apply well decomposed fym @ 4.0 t/acre or vermicompost @ 2.0 t/acre treated with trichoderma 4 kg/acre at the time of field preparation. • apply vermicompost and fym at 1 week and 3-4 weeks before sowing, respectively.

Weeds
• at the time of fi eld preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique i.e. Pre sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage after emergence of weeds.

Soil borne pathogens nematodes and resting stages of insects
Cultural control: • deep ploughing of fi elds during summer to control nematodes and helicoverpa. • three summer ploughings at 10 days interval reduce juvenile population of pests. • soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil borne pests. • conserve the entamopathogenic fungi such as paecilomyces lilacinus

Seed sowing/seedling*

Common cultural practices: • use resistant/tolerant varieties • select seeds from disease free fields • grow pigeon pea intercropped or mixed with cereal crops like sorghum. • use certified and weed seed free seeds

Nutrients
• seed treatment should be done with rhizobium and vam (amf)/psb (phosphate solubilizing bacteria ) cultures each @ 240 g/acre. • fertilizers should be applied on soil test basis. Generally, it is recommended to apply 10 to 12 kg nitrogen (n), 20 to 30 kg phosphorous (p) and 12 to 18 kg potassium (k) per acre as basal dose. • in sulphur and zinc deficient areas, apply sulphur @ 10 to 12 kg/ acre and zinc sulphate @ 10 kg/acre in soil at the time of sowing.

Weeds
• always use certified and weed free seeds. • adopt recommended agronomic practices with respect to timely sowing, row spacing, plant population etc. To obtain the healthy plant stand. • intercropping with suitable crops as per regional recommendations.

Wilt, stem blight, dry root rot
Cultural control: • select a field with no previous record of wilt for at least past 3 years. • uproot the wilted plant and use them as firewood or destroy them. • avoid sowing redgram in fields with low-lying patches that are prone to water logging. Biological control: • trichoderma viride 1% wp@ 8 g/kg seed and @ 200 g/acre for soil treatment (wilt &amp; dry root rot) chemical control: • carboxin 37.5% + thiram 37.5% ds @ 4 g/kg seed and 200 g/acre for soil treatment (wilt, stem blight and dry root rot) • thiophanate methyl 70% wp @ 572 g in 300-400 l of water/acre (wilt)

Vegetative stage*

Common cultural practices: • collect and destroy crop debris • judicious use of fertilizers • provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • avoid water logging • avoid any stress to the crop as much as possible • enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed common mechanical practices: • collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant parts • collect and destroy eggs and early stage larvae • handpick the older larvae during early stages of the crop • handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. • use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre • use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • erect bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc. • set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm common biological practices: • conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • augmentative release of natural enemies

Nutrients
• correct micronutrient deficiency if any in standing crop.

Weeds
• the crop should be maintained weed free initially for 6-8 weeks by following timely hoeing and weeding by using power hand tiller/ or manual tools, twice at 20 and 45 days after sowing. • mulches like straw, plastic, etc. Can be used in between the rows to suppress the weed growth.
