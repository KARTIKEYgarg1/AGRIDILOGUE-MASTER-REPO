Small cardamom: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre-sowing*

Common cultural practices: • deep summer ploughing of fi elds to control resting stages of insect pests. • follow crop rotation with non-host crops • field sanitation, rogueing • destroy the alternate host plants • sow the ecological engineering plants • sow/plant sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around cumin crop as a guard/barrier crop • removal and destruction of alternate host weeds

Soil borne pathogens nematodes and resting stages of insects
Cultural control: • practice green manuring and intercropping with redgram for the control of root rot. Biological control: • apply neem cake @ 100 kg/acre at the time of transplanting for reducing capsule borer damage

Seedling/nursery*

Common cultural practices: • grow resistant/tolerant varieties • use healthy, certifi ed and weed seed free seeds/suckers/planting material. • destruction of infested plants • do not use the same site repeatedly for raising the seedlings • raise nurseries away from main plantations to reduce possibilities of infestation and re infestation from the nearby infested plantations. • provide adequate drainage facilities.

I. Primary nursery
• seed treatment with acid or similar chemicals improves germination. Acid scarifi cation with 25 per cent nitric acid for 10 minutes to break the seed coat will enhance germination. • fumigate the beds with 2% formalin (10 liters per bed) 10 days before sowing • after extraction of seeds wash through water to avoiding mucilage and mix with wood ash for shade drying. • bed size should be 6 m in length, 1 m width and 20 cm height after timely sowing and planting. • 30-50 g seeds should be recommended per bed. • select the suckers of high yielding varieties suiting to the location. • select the virus free planting material, vegetative propagation through suckers is the best method.

Weeds
• use vegetative mulches to avoid weed growth in nursery. • weeds should be removed manually as and when required

Ii. Secondary nursery
• prepare beds as in primary nursery • fumigate the beds with 2% formalin (10 l per bed) 10 days before sowing • mixing of well decomposed cattle manure and wood ash with the top layer of the soil will help the seedlings to establish well and to grow vigorously • shade pandals should be provided before transplanting. • mulching the bed with dry leaves will help to conserve soil moisture. • regular watering during dry months, weeding, application of fertilizers, control of pests and diseases.

Weeds
• mulching should be done to check the growth of weeds. • weeds should be removed by using hand tools/hoeing during may, september and december months.

Rhizome weevil**
Cultural control: • provide suffi cient organic manures to encourage better vegetative growth.

Shoot fly**
Cultural control: • provide suffi cient shade to the plants.

Shoot borer
Cultural control: • rogueing and destruction of infested tillers during september-october

Root-knot nematode
Cultural control: • nursery should be raised in nematode free sites or fumigated or solarized beds. • the roots should be pruned prior to distribution or transplanting. • avoiding planting of alternate hosts such as banana, colocasia and jackfruit biological control: • soil application of neem cake @ 500 g/plant.

Damping off or seedling rot
Cultural control: • in the primary nursery, practice thin sowing for avoiding overcrowding of seedlings. Chemical control: • spray/drench the soil with fosetyl-al 80% wp @ 900-1200 g in 300-400 l of water/acre

Primary nursery leaf spot
Cultural control: • raise nursery in fertile soil. • avoid direct sunlight on nursery beds. Use agro shade net. • early sowing of seeds in august-september will ensure mature seedlings which are less prone to diseases during south west monsoon. Chemical control: • spray/drench the soil after germination of seedlings with copper oxy-chloride @ 1 g in 300-400 l of water/acre

Secondary nursery leaf spot**/ cercospora leaf spot
Cultural control: • cardamom seeds should be sown in the month of august – september, to ensure suffi cient growth of seedlings, so that seedlings develop suffi cient tolerance to the disease. Chemical control: • spray/drench the soil with copper oxy-chloride 50% wp @ 1 kg in 300-400 l of water/acre

‘katte’ or mosaic or marble disease
Cultural control: • fill the gaps with healthy disease free materials.

Plantation stage

Common cultural practices: • collect and destroy crop debris. • avoid water logging. • regulate shade in thickly shaded areas. • avoid water stress during fl owering stage. • enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed. • remove and destroy collateral/alternate hosts such as castor, ginger, turmeric in the immediate vicinity. • maintain optimum plant density. • ensure adequate shade of 65-70% in endemic areas and irrigate the crop before attaining critical period. • fill gaps with healthy disease free materials. • mulching the plant basins with green leaves and other organic materials during summer months conserves and maintains the population of native benefi cial microfl ora.

Common mechanical practices: • collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant parts. • collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae. • handpick the older larvae during early stages of crop. • the infested shoots may be collected and destroyed. • handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. • use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre. • use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm. • install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks). • encouragement of golden backed woodpecker and crow-pheasant in the plantation and erect of bird perches @ 20/acre to attract birds of economic importance in biological control. Common biological practices: • conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering. • augmentative release of natural enemies.

Nutrients
• application of organic manures such as fym, cow dung or compost @ 5 kg/plant or neem cake @ 1-2 kg / plant may be done during june-july. • the present recommendation of nutrients for cardamom is n:p2o5:k2o @ 30:30:60 kg/ acre. • the fertilizers may be applied in two split doses, before and after the southwest monsoon, in a circular band of 20 cm wide and 30-40 cm away from the base of the clumps, and mixed with soil.

Weeds
• three rounds of hand tool weeding during may, september and december/january • slash weeding by use of power mower in the inter row space. • use of spade for weeding is to be avoided as it will loosen the soil and cause soil erosion. • the weeded materials may be used for mulching.

Cardamom thrips
• follow the common cultural, mechanical and biological practices cultural control: • removal of dry drooping leaves as well as dry leaf sheath (trashing) during january- february. • destruction of collateral host plants. • detrashing and weeding reduce thrips infestation. Biological control: • release chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi @ 2 larvae/plant in early stage of the plant and 4 larvae/plant in later stage chemical control: • spray quinalphos 25% ec @ 240-480 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or phenthoate 50% ec @ 200 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or diafenthiuron 50% wp @ 320 g in 400 l of water/ acre or monocrotophos 36% sl @ 374.8 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre

Shoot borer
• follow the common cultural, mechanical and biological practices cultural control: • castor seeds 0.4-0.8 kg/acre may be sown as trap crop in open areas/ boundary. • rogueing and destruction of infested tillers during september-october. Mechanical control: • castor infl orescence with capsules infested by shoots and capsule may be collected and destroyed. • use of pheromones in the monitoring of the pest and therefore correct timing of application of biorationals shall be recommended. Biological control: • application of bacillus thuringiensis when early-instar larvae are found in capsule or panicle or unopened lead buds i.e., within 20 days of adult moth emergence.

Early capsule borer
• follow the common cultural, mechanical and biological practices mechanical control: • clipping the infl orescence/fl ower parts of alternate hosts viz., alpinia speciosa, a.mutica, amomum ghaticum, a. Pterocarpum, curcuma heilyherrensis, hedydium ceranarium during off season (december to may). Chemical control: • diafenthiuron 50% wp @ 320 g in 400 l of water/acre

White grub/root grub
• follow the common cultural, mechanical and biological practices cultural control: • avoid planting of jack, mango, fi g etc. As shade trees as these trees are alternate hosts of the pest. • mulching of plant base with leaves of wild helianthus sp. To prevent egg laying of adult beetles. • earthing up and detrashing. • irrigation @15–20 l per plant reduces root grub population. Mechanical control: • set up light trap @ 1/acre. Biological control: • local strain of epn (heterorhabditis indica) application @ 1,00,000 nematodes (ijs) / plant
