Coconut

Soil

Red, sandy loam, red sandy loam soils are good. In flood prone area and low lying area having water stagnation problem, generally coconut is not recommended. Almost in all types of soil, coconut can be grown.

Variety

Assam tall, kamrupa cultivars are best suited for assam. Hybrids like, d.x.t., txd may be planted for commercial cultivation. Dwarf variety of coconuts are planted in front of the house for ornamental purposes.

Selection of mother palm

The mother palm should be free from any pest & disease. Palm should have a minimum of 30 fully opened leaves. Age of the palm should be above 20 years and should produce more than 100 nuts/ palm in a year regularly.

Selection of seed coconut

Coconuts may be harvested from october to january for seed purpose. 
Twelve months old fully matured coconuts may be harvested for better germination.
The seednuts should be of medium size, round/oblong shape.

Selection of coconut seedling

Seedlings should be of 9 to 12 months old.
Seedlings should have 6-7 green leaves and caller girth may be of 10 cm dia.
Early splitted leaves of seedlings indicate early production. 

Planting

Time of planting at main field - planting may be done from april, may to sept, october according to the land condition. Early planted seedlings get established during monsoon period.

Spacing - in square system, planting distance should be 8mx8m. 156 seedlings can be planted in 1 ha. Area i.e. 21 plants can be accommodated in a bigha of land. Higher spacing is always better for inter/ mixed cropping.

Size of the pit - size of the pit may be of 1mx1mx1m. In hard soil, size can be increased to 1.2mx1.2mx1.2m.

Pit mixtures and filling of pits - this can be made by mixing top soil, 500g rock phosphate/ s.s.p. 50 kg dry cowdung/compost, 100g 10% sevidol. In hard soil, 1 kg salt may be given at the bottom of the pit for loosening the soil. After planting a bund may be made around the pit for preventing run off water.

Fertilizer application

In order to increase the production and productivity of coconuts organic and inorganic fertilizers need to be applied every year. The quantity of fertilizers to be applied for each palm per year are given below

50 kg dry cowdung compost, green leaves and 50 gram. Borax per palm/year along with above mentioned fertilizers should be applied around the palm in circular basin of 1.8m. Radius with 30cm and 25cm. Depth and irrigated for proper absorption. The basins may be filled up after application of fertilizers.

Irrigation

Irrigation can increase 30 to 40% production of coconuts, hence coconuts should be irrigated 150 to 200 liters of water per palm once in four days. It should be given around the coconut basin of 2m. Radius during dry period from november to february for getting higher production. The coconut basin should be mulched with dried lives, coconut husks and other organic wastes for moisture conservation and increasing soil fertility and production of coconuts.

Prevention of diseases

In case of bud rot affected palm the affected portion of the crown should be removed and apply bordeaux paste/ bliton paste and protect it from rain by providing a polythene covering. If the palm is affected by ganoderma disease, 10ml. Calixin mixed with 100 ml water kept in a polythene bag may be applied through root feeding. 5 kg neem cake or 100 kg compost may be applied to affected palm. 100 gm borax may be applied around the palm basin in the crown choking affected palm and repeated after three months.
