Rain deficit moisture stress management in spices

Black pepper

Late onset of monsoon by 15 days

Established plantations 

 mulch the basins &amp; interspaces with green leaves.

To prevent termite attack on live supports, drench the soil with chlorpyriphos 0.075% and spray on support up to 1 m height; repeat spray after 21 days if necessary 

Very young plantations 

Mulch the basins &amp; interspaces with green leaves/coir pith compost.
Protect young vines by providing sufficient shade.
