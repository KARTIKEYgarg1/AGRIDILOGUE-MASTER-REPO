* yield kg/ha (dry)

Season

June - july and october - november

Seed rate

12 kg/ha is required

Seed treatment

Treated with azospirillum 1.5 kg/ha + trichoderma viride @ 50 g/ha for 12 kg of seeds.

Field preparation and sowing

Prepare the main field to a fine tilth.
Add fym 20 - 25 t/ha before last ploughing. Form beds and channels of 3.5 x 1.5 m.
Seeds are sown at a spacing of 20 x 15 cm. Spray pre-emergence herbicide fluchloralin 700 ml in 500 lit of water per ha.

Manuring

Basal - fym 20 - 25 t/ha and n, p, k at 30:25:40 kg/ha.

Top dressing - 20 kg of n at 30 days after sowing.

Irrigation

First irrigation is given immediately after sowing, second on the third day and subsequently at 7 - 10 days intervals.

After cultivation

Plants are thinned at 20 - 25 days after sowing and the thinned seedlings are used as greens. One pinching at a height of about 4‚Äù will encourage branching.weeding is done as and when necessary.

Plant protection

Diseases root rot: root rot can be controlled by soil application of neem cake @ 150 g/ha and seed treatment with trichoderma viride @ 4g/kg of seed and drenching with carbendazim 0.5 g/l or copper oxychloride 2 g/litre. Powdery mildew: dust sulphur at 25 kg/ha or foliar spray with wettable sulphur 2 g/lit at the time of appearance of disease.

Crop duration and harvest

Common methi ( trigonella foenum gracum ) cultivation in jammu

 

Climate

It is cool season crop and can tolerate frost and freezing weather. The areas where rains are heavy and continuous, growing methi should be avoided.

Soil 

Methi can be grown on a wide range of soils. The ideal soil for methi is clay loam. The favorable soil ph is 6-7.

Varieties

Pusa early bunching : it is an early cultivar commonly known as methi. It takes about 125 days from seed to seed.

 manures and fertilizers

 fym (t/ha) - 15 ; n (urea) kg/ha - 60 (120.0) ; p2o5 (dap) kg/ha - 20 (44.0) ; k2o (mop) kg/ha - 20 (34.0)
 apply whole fym, phosphorus, potash and 1/4t h n at the time of sowing and remaining nitrogen @20 kg/ ha after every cutting to get green, tender and succulent leaves. 

Intercultural operations 

Two hoeing and weedings are enough to control the weeds. Pre-plant application of trifluralin (treflan) @ 0.75 kg/ha along with one hand weeding keeps weed under check.

Irrigation 

The first irrigation is given immediately after sowing and subsequently after every 8-10 days. Avoid water stress at pod and seed development stage.

Harvesting 

When common methi is used as leafy vegetable, the young shoots are nipped off in about one month after sowing. The picking of leaves is done by nipping 2cm above ground level leaving the stubs which produces new shoots. Avg. Yield is 70-80 q/ha.

Fenugreek seed production 

The methi is raised for seed production in the same way as for green leaves production. After one month of sowing one-two cutting of green leaves should be taken and then crop is left for raising seed. After one cutting 20 kg n/ha and then irrigate the field. Methi is predominantly a self pollinated and an isolation distance of 10 and 5 m should be maintained for foundation and certified seed production. Crop is ready for seed harvest when pods turn brown and leaves get dry. Green leaves yield: 70-80q/ha ; seed yield: 15-19q/ha

Harvesting 

The crop is meant for flavor and aroma. It is dried as spice crop. The green leaf yield of kasuri type vary from 90-100q/ha while the common type produces an yield of 70-80q/ha.

Kasuri methi seed production 

The crop is raised for seed production in th e same way as for green leaves production. After one month of sowing one-two cutting of green leaves should be taken and then crop is left for raising seed. After one cutting 20 kg n/ha and then irrigate the field.
