Horsegram crop stage wise ipm

Management
 
Activity

Pre-sowing

 

Common cultural practices:

Crop rotation with non host crops 
Timely sowing should be done 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Destroy the alternate host plants 
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations

Nutrients

Apply manures and fertilizers on soil test basis.

Weeds

Destroy weeds manually or by deep summer ploughing.

Soil borne pathogens nematodes, resting stage of insects

Cultural control:

Deep ploughing of fields during summer to manage juvenile population of nematodes and insect pests. 
Soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 75 gauge thickness for six weeks before sowing to reduce the soil borne pests.

Sowing/seedling

 

Common cultural practices:

Do summer ploughing 
Timely sowing should be done 
Solarize the field in summer to help reduce the inoculums. 
Use resistant varieties 
Select seed from disease free fields

Weeds

Always use certified and weed free seeds. 
Timely sowing should be done. 
Line sowing should be done to facilitate inter-culture operations. 
Plant population should be maintained to its optimum right from its beginning to minimize the crop weed competition. 
Adopt suitable crop rotation to minimize dodder and orobanche weeds

Vegetative stage

 

Avoid excess application of nitrogen 
Adopt the ecological engineering strategy. 
Conserve natural enemies 
Remove and destroy weeds periodically 
Removal and destruction of infected/infested plants

Common biological practices:

Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies

Nutrients

Correct micronutrient deficiency if any in standing crop. 
Foliar application of thiourea @500ppm solution twice: 1st spray during vegetative growth and 2nd spray at flowering stage. It is effective under all conditions.

Weeds

Keep field boundary &amp; bunds free from weeds. 
The crop field should be weed free initially for 4-5 weeks by following timely hoeing and weeding. 
Inter-culture operation/hoeing should be done twice at 20 and 35 days after sowing-using hand hoe to remove all weeds in between the row.

Leafhopper

Biological control:

Spray neem seed kernel extract (nske) 5%.
Spray neem oil @ 1%

Little bean bug

Biological control:

Spray neem seed kernel extract (nske) 5%.
Spray neem oil @ 1%

Anthracnose, bacterial leaf blight,cercospora leaf spot

Cultural control:

Early planting i.e. Immediately after onset of monsoon. 
Grow crop on bower system to avoid soil contact. 
Maintain proper drainage in the field.

Powdery mildew

Cultural control:

Bower system (maintain gapping) of cropping reduces the disease incidence

Root rot

Cultural control:

Plant in well-draining soils. 
Prepare seed beds to enhance rapid germination 
Proper irrigation is provided to prevent flooding and saturated soil conditions.
Soil amendment with farm yard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre

Mosaic complex

See the common cultural practices

Flowering

Pod borer

Cultural control:

Follow the intercropping systems like horsegram +maize, horsegram+ finger millet 

Biological control:

Conserve and augment common predators and parasitoids

Reproductive (pod development)

Pod borer

Cultural control:

Follow the intercropping systems like horsegram +maize, horsegram+ finger millet 

Biological control:

Conserve and augment common predators and parasitoids

Nutrients

Incorporate crop residues in soil immediately after harvest.

Weeds

Remove left over weeds to prevent weed seed spread in field.
