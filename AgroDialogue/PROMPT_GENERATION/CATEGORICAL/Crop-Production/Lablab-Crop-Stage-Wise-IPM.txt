Pre-sowing

Common cultural practices: 

 deep summer ploughing and solarization of soil
 timely sowing should be done. 
 field sanitation, rogueing 
 destroy the alternate host plants
 apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations
 use resistant varieties 
 use disease-free certified seeds 
 crop rotation with non-leguminous crops especially cereals.
 avoid dense sowing 
 soil amendment with farm yard manure @ 5 tonnes/acre

Nutrients

 before sowing, circular pits of 0.5 m cube are dug during summer. 
 apply well decomposed fym @ 10-15 kg per pit

Weeds

At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique i.e. Pre-sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in field.

Stem blight, nematode, pod borer

Cultural control:

 follow optimum sowing depth of 5-7 cm.
 intercropping with mustard and american marigold where nematodes are a problem
 besides this american marigold also act as trap crop for helicoverpa armigera.
 application of fym/neem cake or mahua cake @ 200 kg/acre.

 chemical control: 

 spray chlorpyrifos 20% ec@ 1200ml diluted in 200-400 l of water/acre.(pod borer)

Sowing/ seedling

Common cultural practices: 

 timely and line sowing should be done 
 use healthy, certified and weed free seeds. 
 sow with proper spacing

Nutrient

 seed treatment should be done with rhizobium cultures @ 250 g/acre. 
 at the time of sowing apply phosphatic fertilizers @ 30 g per pit.
In sulphur and zinc deficient areas, apply sulphur and zinc sulphates as per soil test recommendation in soil at the time of sowing.
 grow sorghum or bajra as intercrop.

Weed management

 line sowing should be done to facilitate inter-culture operations.
 plant population should be maintained by gap filling to achieve the optimum plant population and minimize the competition from weed.

Nematodes

Cultural control: 

 mulching with straw/pine needles/eucalyptus leaves.

Bean mosaic virus

Mechanical control: 

 rougeing of bmv infected plants

Note: apply trichoderma viride/harzianum and pseudomonas fluorescens for treatment of seed/seedling/planting materials in the nurseries and field application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim and date of expiry. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).

Vegetative stage

Common cultural practices: 

 provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop 
 avoid water stress and water stagnation conditions. 
 enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval parasitoids are observed

 common mechanical practices: 

 collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae 
 collect and destroy diseased infected and insect infested plant parts
 use yellow sticky traps for aphids @ 4-5 traps/acre. 
 use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm 
 install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) 
 erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc. 
 set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm 

Common biological practices: 

 conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
 augmentative release of natural enemies

Nutrient

Correct micronutrient deficiency if any in standing crop

Weed 

 beans suffer severe competition from weeds in initial stages. First 20-30 days after planting is the critical period for crop weed competition. Hand tool weeding at 25 days after sowing is beneficial.

Bean aphid

Cultural control: 

 regular field monitoring and use sweep net in the morning hours for monitoring of pest and defender population, barrier crops like mustard crop around the field.
 attractant plants like sunflower are helpful for attraction of predator. 
 plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum or millet to reduce pest population.

Mechanical control:

 set up yellow sticky traps @4-5 traps/acre 
 pruning of affected plant parts 
 use of reflective mulches 
 spray with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves. 

Biological control: 

 conserve predators such as ladybird beetles viz., cocciniella septumpunctata, menochilus sexmaculata, hippodamia variegata , brumus suturalis and cheilomones vicina etc. Adult beetle feed @10 to15 adults/day.
 conserve predators such as syrphid flies i.e., sphaerophoria spp., eristallis spp., metasyrphis spp., xanthogramma spp and syrphus spp. Etc.
 conserve predators such as lacewing, chrysoperla zastrowii sillemi etc.
 spraying of lecanicillium (verticilium) lecanii @ 5 g/litre of water
 spray insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil

Red spider mite

Cultural control: 

 frequent irrigation during summer season reduces the mite infestation 
 apart from aforesaid practices, regular monitoring is also mandatory for mites

 biological control:

 conserve predators such as chrysoperla zastrowii sillemi, anthocorid bug, predatory mite (amblyseius fallacis), coccinellid (stethorus punctum) etc

Mosaic virus

Cultural practices: 

 all the infected plants should be removed carefully and destroyed.

Bacterial leaf spot

Cultural control: 

 avoid irrigation at flowering stage when the probability of symptom appearance is maximum

Powdery mildew

Cultural control: 

See the common cultural practices as in vegetative stage

 chemical control:

 spray benomyl 50 % wp @ 80gm diluted in 240 l of water/acre. Or 
 spray carbendazim 50%wp @ 140gm diluted in 300 l of water/acre. Or 
 spray sulphur 40% wp @ 2.26-3 kg diluted in 300-400 l of water/acre. Or 
 spray sulphur 85% dp @ 6-8 kg /acre.

Ashy stem blight

Cultural control: 

 see the common cultural practices as in vegetative stage

Anthracnose and rust

 cultural control: 

Balanced use of fym and fertilizers.
 planting in well drained soil.

 mechanical control: 

 mulching with pine needles or eucalyptus leaves reduces the angular leaf spot. 

Chemical control: 

 spray benomyl 50 % wp @ 80gm diluted in 240 l of water/acre (anthracnose) spray lime sulphur 22% sc @ 1% 0.8-2 l /acre (rust)

Flowering stage

Nutrients

 top dress plants with 100 g of di-ammonium phosphate (dap) in each pit at the time of flowering, mixed well in soil and then irrigate. 
 incorporate healthy crop residues in soil immediately after harvest

Weeds

 remove left over weeds before shedding of seeds to prevent their spread.

Bean aphid

 as mentioned in the vegetative stage

Jassid

 as mentioned in the vegetative stage

Pod borers

Cultural control:

 growing intercrops such as onion, maize, coriander in 1:2 ratio, guard crop sorghum or maize in 4 rows all around main crop
 rotate the crop with a non-host cereal crop, cucurbit, or cruciferous vegetable.

 mechanical control: 

 use of ovipositional trap crops such as marigold for helicoverpa. 
 pheromone trap @ 4-5 traps/ acre for helicoverpa
 erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre

 biological control: 

 grow repellant plant(s): basil
 attractant plants: carrot family, sunflower family, buck wheat, hairy vetch, alfalfa, corn, shrubs (minute pirate bug and lace wing)
