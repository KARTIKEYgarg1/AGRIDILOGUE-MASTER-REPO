Grapes: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre sowing stage*

Common cultural practices: • deep ploughing of fields during summer to control nematodes population, to expose pupae and popagules of soil borne pathogens. • soil solarization can be done for sterilizing the nursery mixture • timely sowing should be done. • field sanitation, rogueing. • destroy the alternate host plants as well as crop debris • crop rotation with non-cereals. • adopt ecological engineering by growing the attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the field bunds.

Nutrients
• the rooted grapevine cuttings are planted in pits at an appropriate spacing depending on the soil, agro-climatic conditions and varieties. • grape is a heavy feeder of nutrients. Nutrient should be supplied on the basis of soil test report, varieties and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. • the land should be ploughed well and raise a green manure viz., sunhemp during monsoon and incorporate in-situ in august and september.

Weeds
Cultural control: • plough the field in summer/ before planting to destroy existing weeds in the field. • grow the green manure crop to suppress weeds in rainy season. Chemical control: • 2,4-d sodium salt technical @ 1 kg in 200 l of water/acre • diuron 80% wp@ 0.8 kg in 250 l of water/acre • paraquat dichloride 24% sl@ 0.8 l in 200 l of water/acre

Defoliators/ subterranean pests soil- borne- pathogen
Cultural control: • rabbing with paddy husk/ straw. • for others follow common cultural practices

Sowing stage*

Nutrients
• at the time of planting, fill up the pits with well decomposed farmyard manure @ 50 kg per pit mixed with top soil, trichoderma species and am @ 50g inoculum / plant.

Weeds
• use weed free seedling for planting. • remove existing weeds in and around the pits at the time of planting. • provide plastic or straw mulch around the seedling to prevent weed growth and to conserve moisture.

Root-knot nematode
Cultural control: • intercropping of marigold reduces nematode population • nursery should be raised in nematode free sites or fumigated or solarized beds • repellant plants: marigold • follow common cultural practices. • application of decomposed poultry manure @ 200g / sq. M

Leaf blight anthracnose
Cultural control: • irrigation by rose can. • use of resistant varieties such as– bangalore blue, beauty seedless, bharat early, golden queen, large white. Chemical control: for anthracnose • aureofungin 46.15%w/v. Sp@ 0.005%, 300 l/acre or benomyl 50% wp@120 g in 250-280 l of water/acre or carbendazim 50%wp@ 120 g in 240 l of water/acre or chlorothalonil 75% wp@ 0.2% or 200 g in 100lof water /acre or iprodione 50% wp@ 0.4-0.8 kg in 200 l of water/acre or kitazin 48% ec @ 0.20%or 200 ml in 200 l of water as required depending upon crop stage and plant protection equipment used or mancozeb75%wp @ 0.6-0.8 kg in 300 l of water/acre or ziram80%wp@ 0.6-0.8 kg in 300-400 l of water/acre

Vegetative stage

Common cultural practices: • provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • avoid water stress and water stagnation conditions. • enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval parasitoids are observed common mechanical practices: • collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae • removal and destruction of dead vines along with root system from the garden is essential as this reduces the build up of inoculum (fungal population). • collect and destroy diseased and insect infected plant parts • use blue sticky traps for thrips @ 4-20 traps/acre. • install pheromone traps @ 4-5 traps/acre • use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc. • set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm common biological practices: • conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • augmentative release of natural enemies.

 • apply nutrients through combination of organic manures (40%) and inorganic fertilizers (60%). • in both the seasons prior to pruning the top 15 to 20 cm soil in the basin is dug out and heaped around the trunk. Organic manures are spread uniformly in the basins and then fertilizers are applied and covered with soil. • apply fertilizers around root feeding zone i.e. At about 15 cm depth and 60 cm away from the trunk.
 

Weeds
• regular weeding is important during the young stage of plants. • break the crust with hand hoe each time after irrigation. • plough the area between the basins during the pre-monsoon, post-monsoon periods. • integrated weed management including cover crops, judicious use of herbicides, intercropping and hand weeding wherever necessary should be adopted. • under highly weed infested orchards, apply 2, 4-d sodium salt technical (having 2, 4-d acid 80 % w/w) @ 1lit per acre in 200 l water to control broadleaf weeds or apply diuron 80% wp @ 0.8 kg per acre in 250 l water to control wide range of weeds or paraquat dichloride 24% sl @ 0.8 kg/ acre in 200 l water as post-emergence directed inter row application at 2-3 leaf stage of grasses, sedges and broad leaf weeds.

Leaf eating caterpillar
Cultural control: • growing of castor as trap crop all around the vineyard for oviposition. • follow common cultural and mechanical practices. Biological control: • spraying nske 5 % against eggs and first instar larva • follow common biological practices

Stem borer/cane borer
Cultural control: • piercing the infested plants with a sharp needle or knife to kill the caterpillar in the stem. • remove loose bark at the time of pruning to prevent egg laying • follow common cultural practices. Biological control: • follow common biological practices.

Hoppers
Cultural control: • plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum or pearl millet to reduce hopper infestations. • keep the nursery area clean, free of weeds and grasses to keep away the grass hoppers. • removal of weeds and alternate hosts plants like hibiscus, okra, custard apple, guava etc. In vineyards. Biological control: • follow common biological practices. Chemical control: • spray oxydemeton–methyl 25% ec @ 400 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre

Mealybugs
Cultural control: • removal of weeds and alternate host plants like hibiscus, okra, custard apple, guava etc in and nearby vineyards throughout the year. • deep ploughing in summer or raking of soil in vineyards helps to destroy its nymphal stages and minimizing the incidence. Mechanical control: • remove and destroy the loose bark. Biological control: • release exotic predator, cryptolaemus montrouzieri @ 10 beetles/vine • neem based, emulsifiable water soluble formulations can be sprayed. Doses depend on azadirachtin concentrations in formulations viz., 50000 ppm formulation is sprayed at 1ml / l, while that with 10000 ppm and 3000 ppm can be sprayed at 2.5 ml and 5 ml per l, respectively. Chemical control: • buprofezin25%sc@400-600 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or methomyl40%sp@ 500 g in 200-400 l of water/acre

Flea beetle
Cultural control: • remove the loose bark at the time of pruning to prevent egg laying. • shake vines to dislodge adult beetles, collect into trays containing kerosenated water (1 kerosene: 9 water) and destroy them. • put bundles of dry shreds of banana on the pruned end of the vines in the evening. Beetles, which take shelter on these at night, can be shaken and collected in the morning and kill them. • use high quality, large, vigorous seed- the quicker a seedling can establish itself the more damage it can withstand from flea beetles. • seed early - a plant that establishes quickly can ward off flea beetles more effectively. Caution advised if high populations are seen early in fields when planting. Crops must be monitored daily upon emergence for damage. • crop rotation - flea beetles over-winter along field edges and migrate so following a crop rotation does not make your crop immune to flea beetles, but if problems with flea beetles persisted the year before,planting canola again will contribute to high populations once again. • direct seeding - provides a microclimate that warms slower than a conventionally seeded crop. Cooler temperatures slow flea beetle activity, reducing damage. • increase seeding rates - increased plant populations means less damage to each specific plant. • wider row spacing - reduces the attractiveness to the flea beetles mechanical control: • follow common practices. • setting up of light trap @ 1/acre (6-10 pm). Botanical control: • neem based, emulsifiable water soluble formulations can be sprayed. Doses depend on azadirachtin concentrations in formulations viz., 50000 ppm formulation is sprayed at 1ml / l, while that with 10000 ppm and 3000 ppm can be sprayed at 2.5 ml and 5 ml per liter dose, respectively. Chemical control: • imidacloprid17.8%sl@120-160 ml in 400 l of water/acre or lambda-cyhalothrin 4.9%cs @100 g in 200-400 l of water/acre or malathion50% ec@400 ml in 600-800 l of water/acre

Girdle beetle/grape cane girdler
Cultural control: • cutting of infested shoot bellow the lower girdle before adult emerge in the summer and destroy them may help to reduce the population of insects. • if low levels of grape cane borer are present in your vineyard, populations can be reduced by cultural practices such as removal and destruction of affected canes and excess dead wood from the canopy during pruning. Chemical control: • malathion 50% ec @ 400 ml in 600-800 l of water/acre

Thrips
Cultural control: • install 4-20blue sticky coloured traps per acre to monitor thrips population. • deep ploughing in summer or raking of soil in vineyards helps to destroy its nymphal stages and minimizing the incidence. • removal of weeds and alternate host plants like hibiscus, okra, custard apple, guava etc. In and nearby vineyards in and around the vineyards throughout the year. • collect and destroy damaged leaves, fruits and flowers. Chemical control: • emamectin benzoate 5% sg @ 88 g in 200-400 l of water/acre or fipronil 80%wg @ 20-25 g in 300-400 l of water/acre or lambda-cyhalothrin 4.9% cs @100 g in 200-400 l of water/acre

Cultural control: • avoiding injuries to the ripe berries helps to reduce soft rot. • clean planting stock; (i) disease wood removal and immediate burning; (ii) fungicide application at shoot extension and later if temperatures are cool.

Birds. Bats
Cultural: • remove nesting and roosting areas • bird patrols: takes time and energy but still effective, wear bright colors • pyrotechnics – bombs and whistlers • whistles: thunderer is the cadillac of whistles • site selection: no trees, open fields • noise makers: propane canons, electronic scare devices • nets: still the best option for full protection • traps • tape, balloons, kites, etc. • trap crops

Postharvest

Black mould rot, blue mould rot, green mould rot, botrytis rot
Cultural control: • careful handling and prompt refrigeration to 1-2 ºc or below prevents the disease in storage. • inclusion of so2 releasing pads in the boxes while packing helps to control the disease.

Rhizopus rot
Cultural control: • inclusion of so2 releasing pads in the boxes 2 while packing, removing of diseased berries during grading, avoiding injury to the berries while packing and handling helps to restrict the growth of fungi. • avoiding injuries to the ripe berries helps to reduce soft rot. Physical control: • maintaining cold storage temperature between 40-10 ºc prevents fungal growth.

Note: apply trichoderma viride/harzianum and pseudomonas fluorescens as soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).
