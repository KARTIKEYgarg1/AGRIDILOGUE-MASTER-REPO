Turmeric: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activities

Pre-sowing*

Nutrients
• turmeric crop requires clean cultivation and fi ne tilth. • turmeric needs very heavy manuring during the four months period after planting. Crop requires 120 kg n, 50 kg p2o5 and 80 kg k 2o per acre in organic and inorganic forms. • the npk requirement has to be applied in two or three splits. The first dose of n has to be applied before planting through inorganic sources. • use 10 t/ acre farmyard manure or 4 t / acre vermicompost at the time of field preparation. • apply castor or neem cake @ 200 kg/ acre. • incorporate manure / compost in soil at 2 -3 weeks before planting. • use coir compost @ 1 t/acre combined with fym, biofertilizers (azospirillum). • use leguminous green manure crops like pigeon pea, black gram, cowpea, cluster bean and french bean and incorporate in soil before planting.

Weeds
• deep summer ploughing and solarisation during summer reduces weed infestation, soil borne diseases, nematodes, etc. • use raised beds (30 cm with 1 meter width). • at the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to minimize weeds menace in field.

Pests, nematode, soil borne pathogens and other diseases
Cultural control: • deep summer ploughing during summer. • soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil borne pests. Biological control: • at the time of planting, apply 25 g powdered neem cake and mix well with the soil in each pit taken at a spacing of 20-25 cm within and between rows or application of neem cake @ 2 t/ acre is also desirable.

Rhizome rot/ soft rot
Cultural control: • use of resistant varieties to rhizome wilt/ rot. • crop rotation with maize, cotton, soybean. • planting of disease-free seed rhizomes. • use raised beds of 30 cm height. • flooding treatment for 30 days, soil solarisation during hottest months for 60 days • treat the rhizomes with hot water at 51° c for 10 minutes. • rhizomes treatment can be done by keeping them under clear polythene sheet under direct sunlight for raising the temperature 48o c and this temperature is retained for 30 minutes. • use bio-fumigation using cabbage and mustard plant refuses. • use raised beds of 15-30 cm height, 1 m width and of convenient length may be prepared giving at least 50 cm spacing between beds. Biological control: • planting of perennial / seasonal flowering plants like basil, marigold, fennel, sunflower etc. Along the border to attract and enhance the population of biocontrol agents for managing pests/disease. • application of pine needle and neem cake powder treatments @ 100 kg/ acre (in two splits) • application of oil cakes made from azadirachta indica, calophyllum inophyllum, pongamia glabra, hibiscus sabdariffa and brassica campestris @ 0.8 tonnes/ acre

Bacterial wilt**
Cultural control: • soil solarisation for 60 days during summer • planting of disease-free seed rhizomes. • use crop rotation with non-host crops like ragi, paddy, maize, sorghum etc. • avoid crop rotation with tomato, potato, chillies, brinjal and peanut, as these plants are hosts for the wilt pathogen ralstonia solanacearum. • rhizome treatment with hot water 47oc for 3 minutes. • use bio-fumigation using cabbage and mustard plant refuses. • avoid over irrigation, and flood irrigation in disease affected areas. • it is sensitive to high ph (alkaline soils).

Planting/ seedling stage*

Nutrients
• the npk requirement has to be applied in two or three splits. The first dose of n has to be applied before planting through inorganic sources. • apply p2o5 @ 24 kg/acre as basal dose at the time of planting/ sowing. • apply k2o @ 16 kg/acre as basal dose at the time of planting/ sowing. • in zinc deficient areas, apply zinc sulphate @ 8 kg/acre.

Weeds
• green mulching: the first mulching is done at the time of planting with green leaves @ 4.8- 6 tones /acre. Mulching is to be repeated @ 3 tones /acre at 45 and 90 days after planting, immediately after weeding, application of fertilizers and earthing up.

Rhizome rot/soft rot
Cultural control: • maintain proper drainage by using 30 cm raised bed and avoiding the water stagnation • adopt phyto sanitary measures like infected plants should be uprooted and destroyed. • adopt crop rotation with non-host crops like ragi, paddy, maize, sorghum etc. • mulching with green leaves (lantana camara and vitex negundo) @ 4- 4.8 t/acre at the time of planting. (it is repeated @ 5 t/acre 40 and 90 days after planting). Biological control: • foliar application of neem oil @ 0.5% twice at fortnightly interval. • cow dung slurry or liquid manure may be poured on the bed after each mulching to enhance microbial activity and nutrient availability use fermented plant extract (fpe) prepared by using (garlic + onion leaves + canabis sp + wild poisonous plant) + (cow urine) + (em solution) + (extract after washing polished rice) + (alcohol) + (water) (1:1:1:1:1:15), sufficient for 1.0 ha for seed treatment against soft rot. • fpe to be applied after every fortnight by using watering can for next 2 month i.e. Up to july end.

Vegetative &amp; rhizome development stage

Nutrients
• top dressing of n in three splits is done at regular periods just after each weeding at monthly intervals. • apply castor or neem cake @ 200 kg/ acre (if not applied at sowing) along with 24 kg of nitrogen through urea near the rhizomes at 40 days after planting. • apply 24 kg nitrogen and 16 kg potash/ acre at 80 days after planting. • the final dose of 20 kg nitrogen and 14 kg potash/ acre should be applied at 120 days after planting followed by eating up of the crop. • fertilizer application should be completed within 120 days from the time of planting. • chemical fertilizers should be applied along with fym and organic cakes. • as and when micro-nutrient deficiencies like zinc, manganese etc., are observed, it should be corrected by foliar spray. • spray ferrous sulphate @ 5.0 g along with lime salt @ 1.0 g per litre of water to control ‘fe’ deficiency. • to control ‘zn’ deficiency, zinc sulphate @ 5.0 g + 0.5 ml sticking agent per litter of water.

Weeds
• hand hoeing and weeding are necessary at 60, 90, 120 and 150 days after planting in light soils.
