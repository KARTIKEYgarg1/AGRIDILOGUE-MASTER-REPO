Agro-technique

Nursery technique

Raising propagules: root stocks @ 7-10 quintals are required per hectare. Germination of untreated seeds is about 9-12%. Seed treatment with concentrated sulphuric acid for half an hour, followed by treatment of gibberellic acid (ga) 100 ppm enhances germination upto 38%.
Propagule rate and pretreatment: 45000-50000 seedlings per hectare as a mono crop; whereas 30000-40000 seedlings are required for plantation with cajanus cajan (pigeonpea) as a shade plant.

Planting in the field

Land preparation and fertilizer application: land should be ploughed, harrowed 2-3 times to make it to good tilth. Fym @ 20 t/ha may be applied during land preparation. Npk @ 90:30:30 kg/ha is recommended; of this, n is split in 3 doses. The first split of 30 kg n with entire quantity of p and k may be applied at the time of land preparation and rest of nitrogen be applied after 3 and 6 months of planting.
Transplanting and optimum spacing: seeds may be sown in line during march in raised beds 10 cm apart. Frequent watering is necessary. By may-june seedlings are ready for transplantation. Shade must be provided in the plantation. 60x30 cm is recommended optimum spacing.
Intercropping system: cajanus cajan is found as a good intercrop providing shade to the growing plants.
Interculture and maintenance practices: hand weeding and hoeing at 4 months interval in first year; thereafter, twice in a year will keep the fields free from weeds.
Irrigation practices: largely rain fed irrigated in dry season only or as required.
Weed control: weed control is required at 45 days after planting and thereafter at 4 months interval. Pre-emergence application of simazine 2.0 kg/ha or pendimethaline @ 1.0 kg/ha is followed by hand weeding.
Disease and pest control: no pest and disease infestation is observed in the plantation. Deficiency systems of iron are observed sometimes. Soil testing of the land under cultivation is carried before planting.

Harvest management

Crop maturity and harvesting: one year; harvesting time april – may.
Post-harvest management: uprooting by hoe. Tubers must be cleaned from foreign material and then dried under shade for 15-20 days before packing in clean sacks and stored over wooden pallets.
Chemical constituents: plant contains sapogenine (0.1%), high percentage of starch, carbohydrate, sugar and minerals like magnesium, potassium and tannin.
Yield : 500-800 kg dry root yield in second year after planting.

Therapeutic uses

Tubers having medicinal value are used as general tonic, containing the steroid sapogenine (1-2%), protein (10-20%) and calcium.
Tubers are fat free and they have high aphrodisiac property.
It is also useful in diseases like renal calculus, leucorrhoea and diabetes.
