Nature of damage

The caterpillars only caused the damage to mostly upper portion leaves of plant.
The grown caterpillars of a. Aurota easily strip off the branches, devouring leaf after leaf causing great damage.

Description

Fore wing: deep black on apical area, the enclosed white elongate spots more or less obsolete.
Hind wing: the black terminal border much broader and of a deeper black, the enclosed white spots.

Caterpillar is grass-green; dorsal line very distinct, dark green; lateral line very broad, coloured and mottled, dentated into the ground colour.
Due to seasonal variation, geographical distribution and sexual dimorphism there is a marked difference in colour of wings and thickness of veins of a. Aurota fabricius.
The females are larger and with thicker and broader veins, apex and outer margins.
It was observed that the males had thinner black bands as compared to the females in wings.
