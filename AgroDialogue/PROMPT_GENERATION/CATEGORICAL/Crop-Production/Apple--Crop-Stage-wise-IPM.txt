Apple: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre planting*

Nutrients
• pits of 1 meter cube are dug in square system during summer season and kept open for controlling soil born pests. • soils of different horizons should be analysed to know the inherent fertility and soil condition of the field. • the fertilizer dose should be based upon soil fertility, type of soil, kind and age of trees, cultural practices, climate and crop load. • application of manures and fertilizers start right from planting of an orchard at the time of filling of pits. • in an orchard of optimal fertility, n, p and k may be applied in the ratio 70: 30: 70 g/year/tree.

Weeds
· deep ploughing followed by cross harrowing the field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the field.

Planting*

Nutrients
• pits should be filled with a mixture of pond silt, red soil and farmyard manure. • two-three kilos of bone meal or super phosphate per pit should be applied.

Weeds
· adopt intercropping and recommended agronomic practices.

Pests, nematode, soil borne pathogens and other diseases
• grow resistant/tolerant varieties viz.,: emra, red free, ambstraking, ambroyal, ambrich and ambred in the endemic areas for controlling scab and maharaji chunth and golden chinese (apple cultivars),yantarka altaskya, dolgoe (crab apple cultivars) for controlling powdery mildew disease

Scab and powdery mildew
• use healthy infestation-free plants. • aphids usually spread through infested stocks, avoid planting infested stocks.

Woolly apple aphid
• use resistant root-stocks belonging to malling merton series. • ecological engineering with buckwheat attracts parasitoid, aphelinus mali

Vegetative stage 1st year onwards

Nutrients
• the dose should be stabilized (700: 350: 700 g n: p: k/tree) after 10 years of age. These applications may be supplemented with fym @10 kg per tree in the first year and increase as the age of the tree with a maximum of 100 kg. • in off years, the fertilizer dose of npk may be reduced to 500 g, 250 g and 400 g, respectively. In bearing trees, fym along with p and k should be applied during december-january. Nitrogen is applied during february-march, 2 to 3 weeks before bud break. The nitrogen can be applied in two split doses, first dose 2-3 weeks before bud break and the second one, one month after flowering. • the fertilizers should be broadcasted in the tree basins 30 cm away from the tree trunk up to the canopy drip line and mixed well in the soil.

Weeds
Cultural control: • regular weeding should be done in the tree basin. • regular mowing of weeds between tree rows should be done to check the weeds. • ploughing between tree rows. Chemical control: • apply paraquat dichloride 24% sl @ 1300 ml in 280-400 l of water/acre as post-emergence and direct between rows at 2-3 leaf stage of weeds to control grasses and broad-leaved weeds in the orchards.

White rot/root rot**
Chemical control: • for root rot, make 5-10 trunk injections @ 2 g/tree

Reproductive

Nutrients
• in case of any nutritional deficiency observed at flowering and fruiting, it should be corrected immediately by foliar application of that particular nutrient.

Weeds
• keep the orchard weed free by adopting cultural practices as stated in vegetative stage.

Lepidopteran caterpillars (indian gypsy moth)
Mechanical control: • egg mass covered with yellowish hair which is easily visible should be hunted and destroyed (between august-march). • put a burlap at the base of tree trunk to provide shelter for larvae during day time and examine frequently to destroy the larvae underneath the burlap

Scab
Cultural control: • clean cultivation, collection and destruction of fallen leaves and pruned materials in winter to prevent the sexual cycle. • collect and burn the infected plant debris • follow proper trimming and pruning of twigs and branches followed by burning. • apply urea (2 kg/acre at pre-leaf fall stage spring and dolomitic lime (2.5 ton/acre) in autumn over fallen leaves to accelerate decomposition.
