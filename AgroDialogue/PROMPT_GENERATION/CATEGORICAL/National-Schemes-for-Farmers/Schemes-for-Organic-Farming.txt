Schemes for organic farming

India ranks first in number of organic farmers and ninth in terms of area under organic farming. Sikkim became the first state in the world to become fully organic and other states including tripura and uttarakhand have set similar targets.

With the aim of assisting farmers to adopt organic farming and improve remunerations due to premium prices, two dedicated programs namely mission organic value chain development for north east region (movcd) and paramparagat krishi vikas yojana (pkvy) were launched in 2015 to encourage chemical free farming.

About 40,000 clusters are being assisted under pkvy covering an area of about 7 lakh ha. Movcd has brought in its fold 160 fpos cultivating about 80,000 ha.

Paramparagat krishi vikas yojna (pkvy)

"paramparagat krishi vikas yojana (pkvy)” a sub- component of soil health management (shm) scheme under national mission of sustainable agriculture (nmsa) aims at development of models of excellence in organic farming through a mix of traditional wisdom and modern science in value chain mode to install sustainability, ensure long term soil fertility buildup, resource conservation and to offer safe and healthy food grown through organic practices without the use of agro- chemicals. Pkvy also aims at empowering farmers through institutional development through clusters for not only in farm practices management, input production, quality assurance but also in value addition and direct marketing through innovative means. Participatory guarantee system under pgs-india programme will be the key approach for quality assurance under the pkvy.

Organic area selection criteria

Organic farming under pkvy will be promoted preferably in hilly, tribal and rain-fed areas where utilization of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is less and the area has good accessibility for developing market linkages.
Cluster approach will be adopted in large patches of up to 1000 ha area.
Cluster chosen shall be in contiguous patch, as far as possible, may be extending over few adjacent villages (but not over large areas in sparsely distributed villages).
Formation of gram panchayat based farmer producer organizations will be encouraged or already existing fpos will be promoted under the scheme
The ceiling of subsidy a farmer is eligible will be for a maximum of one hectare. In a cluster, there should be at least 65% of small and marginal farmers. Women farmers/ shgs should be given preference

What to do?

Promote paramparagat krishi vikas yojana (pkvy) for different crop/cropping system suitable to agroclimatic conditions.
In organic farming use more bio-chemicals, bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers.
