Introduction

She spent her early childhood assisting her mother in doing agricultural field for growing field crops &amp; vegetables.
Pursuing her education at the same time, she graduated in the year 2010 in the field of arts &amp; literature.
She worked as an accountant in a private school till 2016. She decided to venture out with a dream of becoming a successful agripreneur.
She set up a piggery unit with 9 breeding sow and a boar jointly with a friend by investing little financial resource. A freak of fate, all her pigs were wiped out by an epidemic of classical swine fever.
“failure is the pillar of success” – vevohulu believed it and decided to try another enterprise.

Training & motivation

Khaki campbell is known to be the best layers of all the domestic ducks. Khaki campbell ducks lay about 280 to 300 eggs per year (more in the first 2 years) and, with proper management, will continue to lay well for 4 - 5 years. Campbell’s lay their first eggs between 5 – 7 months of age. Khaki campbells are excellent foragers and withstand cold, hot, humid, or arid climates very well.
In january 2018, ms. Vevohulu churhah approached kvk-phek for guidance &amp; technical assistance.
In march 2018, she undertook duckery project with 200 of khaki campbell breed from kvk after attending a scientific duck farming training organized by the kvkphek.
A total of 100 duckling were provided under nabard sponsored programme being implemented by the krishi vigyan kendra(kvk) and she also contributed for another 100 nos.
Rearing was done in free range system with night shelter. The birds were supplemented with commercial compounded feed twice a day following a brooding period of 45 days. Ad libitum drinking water was provided. The male female ratio was maintained at 1:9. Additional drakes were disposed/sold at 20 weeks.
With counsel on proper feeding, housing and health care, the duck matured and started laying late august 2018 that paved a way for generating income. Now, she is an established entrepreneur and has plan to further expand the enterprise considering the demand.
