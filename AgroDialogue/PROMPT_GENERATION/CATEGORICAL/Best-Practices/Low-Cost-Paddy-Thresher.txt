Low cost paddy thresher

Innovator profile
Based at moriabari, fazlul hoque (50) is a mechanic who has developed a whole stalk paddy thresher capable of threshing moist crop as well.

Fazlul was born to a goldsmith father and though good in studies, could study only up to 7th standard due to his father’s ill health. After his death, he set up his cycle repair shop. Later over the years, he kept switching over from one kind of work to another trying his hands at shutter and grill work, making water filters, washing powder, gates, small agricultural machineries etc. Being the sole bread earner of his family comprising of his wife and six children, he had to face a lot of problems and financial constraints. In order to stay afloat, while he tried his hands at different kinds of tasks, he briefly engaged himself in the collection and sales of scraps. It was during this time that he got a chance to look into various machine’s interior mechanism.

Building upon the knowledge gained, he later started a fabrication unit where he started manufacturing small agro machineries along with spare machinery parts. Presently, he is exclusively manufacturing paddy threshers and has engaged eight people in the fabrication unit. His sons also lend a helping hand in his unit.

Innovation description
In paddy farming, threshing operation, which involves separation of paddy from panicles, is one of the time consuming and laborious conventional methods of paddy threshing manually by beating against stone or by draught animal. Innovator has developed a thresher that can thresh without chopping the straw of the moist crop.

The straw, chaff, grains are separated and thrown separately, thus reducing labor and drudgery. Using this machine threshing can be done even in rainy days under a shade. The thresher can be operated by a 5 hp electric motor or tractor pto. It requires only two people to thresh.

The thresher is consisting of feeding chute, threshing cylinder, blower, straw outlet and grain outlet. The body is made of high quality steel and sheets to withstand maximum wear and tear. These threshers can be operated both with electric motor and diesel engine. The paddy crop's straw is separated from grain in the threshing cylinder. The straw is thrown out from the machine with the help of blower, and the paddies are thrown out through other outlet. The special feature of this machine is that it does not chop the straw and hence we get it in full length.
