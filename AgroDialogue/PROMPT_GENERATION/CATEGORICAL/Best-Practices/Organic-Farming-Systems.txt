Organic farming systems
Organic farming is a method of farming system which promarily aims at cultivation of the land and raising crops in such a way, as to keep the soil alive and in good health by use of organic wastes (crop, animal adn farm waste, aquatic wastes) and other biological materials along with the beneficial microbed (biofertilisers) to release nutrients to crops for increased sustainable production in a necofriendly pollution free environment. Prevailing systems of organic farming in india are vedic krishi, zero budget natural farming, organic farming, biodynamic agriculutre, yogic agriculture, homa farming, natueco farming, permaculture, the one-straw revolution.

Vedic krishi
Vedic krishi is to re-enliven natural law in agriculutre, bringing farmer, the process of farming and the environment in complete harmony with each other. Natural law is the unseen intelligence of nature the upholds and nourishes all life.

Zero budget natural farming (zbnf)
Zero budget natural farming (zbnf) is a concept which promts organic farming without the off farm or market oriented inputs with the ecological friendly techniques under which is based on four basic inputs these are i) beejarmruit ii) jeevamrut iii) aacchadana (mulching) and iv) waaphasa (aeration) this basic concept has been promoted by mr.subash palaker.

Biodynamic agriculture
Biodynamic agriculture is a method of farming to treat the farm as a living system which interacts the environment, to build healthy, living soil and produces food that nourishes adn vitalizes humankind. In this system energies from cosmos, mother earth, mother cows and plants are systematically and synergistically bathnessed. The principle of biodynamic is making life giving compost our of dead material. So far 09 biodynamic preparations have been developed named as formulation bd 500-508.

Yogi agriculture
Yogic agriculture or "sashwat yoga kheti"/ gou mata kheti/ vaishnav kheti, ahinsa farming, adhvoot shivanand farming, and rishi krishi are the other names. This is a process that includes seed empowernment (through mediation), mind and heart development of farmer (through mediation) and integrated organic farming (through cow products, crop rotation and integrated pest management).

Homa farming
Homa farming has its origin from vedas and is based on the principle that "you heal the atmosphere and healed atmosphere will heal you. The basic aspect of homa farming is the chanting of anskrit mantras (agnihotra puja) as specific times in the day before a holy fire. No specific agricultural practice associated with homa farming. The ash that result from puja is used to energies composts, plants, animals etc.

Natueco farming
Natueco farming emphasis 'neighborhood resource enrichment' by additive regeneration' rather than through dependence on external commercial inputs. The three relevant of natueco farming are soil enrichment of soil by recycling of the biomass by establishing a proper energy chain. Roots development and maintenance of white feeder root zone for efficient absorption of nutrients. Canopy harvesting the sun through proper canopy management for efficient photosynthesis. Amrit jal, amrit mitti and ganggamma chakra/ or mandal are used in this system.

Permaculture
Permaculture is a system of cultivation intended to maintain permanent agriculture of horticulture by relying on renewable resources and a self-sustaining ecosystem. An innovative framework for creating sustainable ways of living. It is a practical method of developing ecologically harmonious, efficient and productive systems that can be used by anyone, anywhere. Permaculture is a word orginally coind by bill mollison and david holmgren in the mid 1970's to describe and "integrated evolving system of perennial or self perpeluating plant and animal species usefull to man".

The one-straw revolution
"fukuoka's do-nothing approach to farming is not only rovolutionary in terms of growing food, but it is also applicable to other aspects of living, (creativity, childrearing, activism, career, etc.). He found ways that food could be grown in a non-polluting, sustainable manner. After a number of years, he had rebuilt the soil on his family farm and proved that he could equal or better the yields of the "petroleum farmers" with his no chemical, lazy man's way of natural farming.
