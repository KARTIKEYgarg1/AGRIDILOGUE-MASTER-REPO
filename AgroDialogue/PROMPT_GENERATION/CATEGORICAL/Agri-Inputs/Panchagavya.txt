How to prepare panchagavya?
Cow dung - 7 kg
Cow ghee - 1 kg

Mix the above two ingredients thoroughly both in morning and evening hours and keep it for 3 days
Cow urine - 10 liters
Water - 10 liters

After 3 days mix cow urine and water and keep it for 15 days with regular mixing both in morning and evening hours. After 15 days mix the following and panchagavya will be ready after 30 days.
Cow milk - 3 liters
Cow curd - 2 liters

Jaggery - 3 kg
Well ripened poovan banana â€“ 12 nos.

All the above items can be added to a wide mouthed mud pot, concrete tank or plastic can as per the above order. The container should be kept open under shade. The content is to be stirred twice a day both in morning and evening. The panchagavya stock solution will be ready after 30 days. (care should be taken not to mix buffalo products. The products of local breeds of cow is said to have potency than exotic breeds). It should be kept in the shade and covered with a wire mesh or plastic mosquito net to prevent houseflies from laying eggs and the formation of maggots in the solution. If sugarcane juice is not available add 500 g of jaggery dissolved in 3 liter of water.

Recommended dosage
Spray system: 3% solution was found to be most effective compared to the higher and lower concentrations investigated. Three litres of panchagavya to every 100 litre of water is ideal for all crops. The power sprayers of 10 litre capacity may need 300 ml/tank. When sprayed with power sprayer, sediments are to be filtered and when sprayed with hand operated sprayers, the nozzle with higher pore size has to be used.

Flow system : the solution of panchagavya can be mixed with irrigation water at 50 litre per hectare either through drip irrigation or flow irrigation

Seed/seedling treatment: 3% solution of panchagavya can be used to soak the seeds or dip the seedlings before planting. Soaking for 20 minutes is sufficient. Rhizomes of turmeric, ginger and sets of sugarcane can be soaked for 30 minutes before planting.

Seed storage: 3% of panchagavya solution can be used to dip the seeds before drying and storing them.
