Material required
Spider egg mass of neoscona (female usually remain adjacent to egg mass till it hatches. Selection of egg mass will be made which is under parental care or gravid female of neoscona species.however, it is better to rear the gravid female).
Small jars 500 ml/waste mineral bottle (both side open) covered with cotton cloth.
 food (live moth, house fly, hoppers, nymphal instar of grasshopper or corcyra moth).
Scissor and camel hair brush.
Dry plant materials.

Methodology:
Life cycle of neoscona sp.
Egg mass or gravid neoscona female reared in jar for hatching and/or for egg lying. The spider lings emerge after hatching are very soft and do not require food for first day. 2nd day onwards till the 3rd instars they usually feed on the prey. For feeding living corcyra moth by making it wingless, 3-small hoppers (nymph) or 3-housefy (adult or maggots) or small soft bodied insect pests (sedentary) of different crops can be given to spider lings. After 3rd in stars a few male and female may be collected from the batch for nucleus culture for further rearing and the remaining may be released. It is better if the spider lings at the 3rd in stars are released in the field. From the nucleus culture one male and one female are kept in a jar for mating.

Precautions
The early instars of spiderlings are very soft so the prey to be provided to match the need
Release of spider is best at 3rd instars stage (15-20 days after hatching)
Release is to be made near the dense canopy &amp; preferably in the morning or afternoon.
There is some cannibalism in the late instars if the food is not enough or a large number of individuals are allowed to remain in the small jars.
