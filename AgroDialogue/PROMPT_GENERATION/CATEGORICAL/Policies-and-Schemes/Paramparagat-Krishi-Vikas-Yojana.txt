Paramparagat krishi vikas yojana

“paramparagat krishi vikas yojana” is an elaborated component of soil health management (shm) of major project national mission of sustainable agriculture (nmsa). Under pkvy organic farming is promoted through adoption of organic village by cluster approach and pgs certification.

Expected outcomes

The scheme envisages:

 promotion of commercial organic production through certified organic farming.
The produce will be pesticide residue free and will contribute to improve the health of consumer.
It will raise farmer's income and create potential market for traders. 
It will motivate the farmers for natural resource mobilization for input production. 

Programme implementation

Groups of farmers would be motivated to take up organic farming under paramparagat krishi vikas yojana (pkvy). 
Fifty or more farmers will form a cluster having 50 acre land to take up the organic farming under the scheme. In this way during three years 10,000 clusters will be formed covering 5.0 lakh acre area under organic farming. 
There will be no liability on the farmers for expenditure on certification. 
Every farmer will be provided rs. 20,000 per acre in three years for seed to harvesting of crops and to transport produce to the market. 
Organic farming will be promoted by using traditional resources and the organic products will be linked with the market.
It will increase domestic production and certification of organic produce by involving farmers
