Infrastructure development for harbours and landing centres

The fishing harbours and landing centres are the initial centres of fish handling. Due to poor sanitary and hygienic conditions as well as temperature prevailing at these centres, there is substantial reduction in quality of the fish landed. Provision of clean and sanitary building with ancillary facilities like potable water and ice, fly-proofing arrangements and chilled storage at fishing harbours is an essential requirement to maintain quality and safety requirements for the fish landed. National fisheries development board (nfdb) proposes to provide funding to establish these facilities at incomplete fishing harbours and landing centres.

The nfdb would provide support to those cases where the schemes already taken up by the state governments have remained incomplete even after the original project cost has been fully spent or where after completion of the project, certain critically needed additional facilities have to be created. Further, the board shall finance such projects only if the same can be completed in a reasonable period, and an effective arrangement can be put in place for the management of the facility and the concerned agency agrees to pay to the board 10 to 30% (depending on the extent of financing done by the board for completion of the project) of the gross income from landing and service charges collected.
