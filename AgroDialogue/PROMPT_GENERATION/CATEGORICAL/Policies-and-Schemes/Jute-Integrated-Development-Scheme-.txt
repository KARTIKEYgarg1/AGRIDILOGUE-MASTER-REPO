Jute integrated development scheme 

Jute is agro-renewable, bio-degradable and carbon positive fibre. There is a gradual shift towards use of more and more eco-friendly natural products. The national jute board with the primary objective of promoting and developing business of green jute products, especially jute carry bags as an alternative to plastic carry bags, has formulated the scheme.

Njb with its branch offices will establish collaborative arrangements with the local partners - ngos, shg federations, institutes, entrepreneurs throughout the country to develop, train and promote green jute products.

Objectives of the scheme

To highlight / create more awareness for jute products on the merit of environment related issues. 
To increase the number of skilled workforce for production of jute diversified products in the decentralized sector.
To set up more and more number of production units for use of jute as raw material in order to expand the production base for the diversified jute products.
To create employment for the rural masses in the newly established jute diversified products (jdp) production units
To give thrust for design and development of new and innovative jute products to make the jute products and even the traditional products acceptable in the domestic as well as the foreign markets
To increase demand for consumption of raw jute for producing jdps, thereby ensuring continuous market for the produce of jute farmers
To build up supply chains for certain and smooth supply of jute raw materials to the production units
Establishment of trade channels for promotion of decentralized jdp units.
To increase sale of jdps through market promotion activities to ensure continuous markets for jute products

Outcome of the scheme

This scheme will be implemented by the njb on annual basis. The scheme is to be implemented for six years, beginning 2015-16. It is estimated that by the end of the 6 years period i.e. 2020-21, 100 clusters will have taken shape. This will directly and indirectly benefit at least 160 individual per cluster. It is estimated that during this implementation period, the total involvement of individuals mostly women (wshgs), who will be gainfully engaged in employment in the jute diversification, will be to the tune of at least 15,000.

The outcome of the scheme would also establish the competitive environmental advantages of jute globally as well as boost the sale of jute goods globally and increase the share of jdps too.

Over a period of time, consumption of raw jute will be increased. The environment will remain safe for the mankind as jute is a natural and earth-friendly material.

Scheme details

To achieve the above objectives an integrated and also modular approach has been envisaged and conceptualized with emphasis on the following key elements.

Developmental schemes 
Raw material and retail outlet scheme
Marketing scheme

Further, it will provide escort support services in order to make them full-fledged jute diversified product entrepreneurs over a period of time.

Implementation strategy

Creating awareness and capacity building workshops in different parts of the country on the use of jute and encouraging small and tiny entrepreneurs to manufacture jute diversified products with a sustainable approach.
Promoting use of jute in more diversified application areas by conducting specific training programmes, organising awareness programmes and through product/design development programmes etc

The collaborating agencies for operations under the scheme will be selected from govt. /semi-govt. Organisations, autonomous bodies, reputed public sector organisations, ngos, shg federations, institutes, entrepreneurs having adequate experience in carrying out development activities for promotion of entrepreneurship and industries. These collaborating agencies will act more as facilitators for rendering the backward and forward linkages to existing and potential entrepreneurs.

Raw material and retail outlet support scheme

Supply outlets for distribution of jute raw material are to be developed for making available jute fibre, fabric and yarn in small quantities as required by the micro-enterprises, crafts persons and artisans at their areas at mill gate prices.

Implementation strategy

Setting up of outlets in association with the collaborating partners for selling of jute yarn, fibre and other raw materials across the country at reasonable price, preferably mill gate price

Raw materials and services shall be provided to suit the requirement of small artisans, entrepreneurs, women self-help groups, weavers and handicraft artisans. Linkages will be established with handicrafts and handloom development programmes of the government for better result.

Marketing schemes

Market development due to acceptance of jute products in various segments of the domestic and international markets constitute the background for the activities to be undertaken for promotion of jdps in the decentralized sector. In consonance with the growth of the decentralized jdp sector and the emergence of a varied range of products to cater to different segments of the consumers, a concentrated campaign bundled with existing sop (student outreach programme) may be launched and carried out on a long term basis.
