Need for rural godowns
It is well known that small farmers do not have economic strength to retain produce with them till the market prices are favourable. A network of rural godowns will enable small farmers to enhance their holding capacity in order to sell their produce at remunerative prices and avoid distress sales.

Accordingly, government of india has launched ‘grameen bhandaran yojana’ w.e.f. 01.04.2001. The scheme has been subsumed into capital investment subsidy sub-scheme "agricultural marketing infrastructure (ami)" of integrated scheme for agricultural marketing (isam) scheme w.e.f 01.04.2014. Ami scheme is temporarily stopped w.e.f. 05.08.2014 for general category promoters due to exhaustion of funds. However, the scheme is open for sc/st promoters and for promoters in north-eastern region.

Objective of the scheme
Main objectives of scheme include creation of scientific storage capacity with allied facilities in rural areas to meet out various requirements of farmers for storing farm produce, processed farm produce, agricultural inputs, etc., and prevention of distress sale by creating the facility of pledge loan and marketing credit.
