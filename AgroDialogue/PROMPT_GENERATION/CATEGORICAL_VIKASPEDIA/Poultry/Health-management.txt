Bird Flu in India

About bird flu



Birds, just like people, get the flu. Bird flu, also called Avian flu, Avian influenza viruses infect birds, including chickens, other poultry and wild birds such as ducks. Most bird flu viruses can only infect other birds. However, bird flu can pose health risks to people. The first case of a bird flu virus infecting a person directly, H5N1, was in Hong Kong in 1997. Since then, the bird flu virus has spread to birds in countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.

Deadly H5N1 strain hit India in January. More than 3.9 million chickens and ducks were culled to prevent the spread of the virus across the country, Food and Agriculture Organisations said in a statement on Wednesday. No new disease outbreaks have been discovered since Feb. 2, 2008, FAO said. Avian influenza hits mostly birds but its H5N1 strain has killed 234 people since 2003 when it began in Asia, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).



During an outbreak of bird flu, people who have contact with infected birds can become sick. It may also be possible to catch bird flu by eating poultry that is not well cooked or through contact with a person who has it. Bird flu can make people very sick or even cause death. There is currently no vaccine.
