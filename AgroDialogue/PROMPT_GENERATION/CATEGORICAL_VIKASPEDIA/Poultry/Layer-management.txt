Layer management


Points to be considered during layer management


Proper cleaning and disinfection of layer house.
 Broody hen may be separated and this broodiness may be eliminated by, 
Provide proper floor space, feeding space and watering space both in deep-litter and cage system
In deep-litter system, floor space of 2 sq.ft. per bird and feeding space of 5” per bird are provided
In cage system 4 birds/box of 18” x 15” cage floor space is provided (0.46 sq. ft per bird)
6 feet linear feeder can be used for every 30 layers or 18” diameter circular feeder of 4-5 no for every 100 birds.
Provide 18” diameter plastic waterer of 2 numbers for every 100 birds.
Spread litter material, in case of deep-litter system up to 6” thickness.
Arrange feeder and waterer in the poultry house to the height of birds’ back.
Grill size may be changed according to the size of the birds head.
Provide nest box for every 5 layers about a week before the first egg is laid.
There are three types of nest: 1) Individual nest – One nest box is sufficient for 4-5 birds.  2) Community nest – This will accommodate 50-60 birds.  3) Trap nest – This will accommodate 1 bird at a time ad is used for academic and breeding studies.
The nest should be provided with litter material.  The litter material has to be replaced at least once in a week to prevent contamination of the eggs.  During night hours the nest should be closed to prevent sitting of birds in the nest.
In deep-litter system, the litter material should be racked in the evening daily after egg collection is over.  The litter should be treated chemically at least once in a month or whenever necessary in case of wet litter problem to prevent ammonia emission in the house.
Provide 16 hours light during laying period.
Provide well-balanced layer mash.  Phase feeding may be followed for layers according to age, level of production and climatic factors.  The average feed consumption during laying period ranges from 100-110 gram.
Feed consumption during winter increases and during summer, feed consumption decreases.  Summer and winter management should be followed for better flock percentages.
Deworming should be done regularly at an interval of 6-8 weeks depending on the worm load, especially when reared under deep-litter system.
Collect the eggs at least 5 times a day in deep-litter system and twice a day in cage system.
Cull the unproductive layers regularly.
