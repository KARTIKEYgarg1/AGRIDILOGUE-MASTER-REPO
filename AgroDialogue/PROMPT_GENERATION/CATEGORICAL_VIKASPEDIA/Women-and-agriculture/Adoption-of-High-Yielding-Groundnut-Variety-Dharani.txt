Source of Motivation

After undergoing a number of training programmes on pulse and oilseeds production technologies, Ms. Rashmita Sahu had shown interest in cultivating groundnut with new High Yielding Variety (HYV) and improved package of practices as guided by Scientists of KVK, Ganjam. KVK scientists helped her in all technical aspects to grow Groundnut, Var. Dharani and provided other inputs.

Contributing Factors


Using HYV groundnut variety Dharani which is drought tolerant, having uniform maturity, attractive pods and moderate stature.
Adoption of recommended packages of practices ensured better yield

Influence on Other Farmers


Farmers in the village developed interest in scientific cultivation of groundnut with good High Yielding variety and proper technology

Achievements
