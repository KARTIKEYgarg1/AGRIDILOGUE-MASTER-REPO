Dairy Farmer Engineered her Success through Technology

Introduction


Dairy farming is very profitable business. Punjab has been playing significant role in the development of dairy production over the past few decades.
Besides men’s role, women also play crucial role in agriculture especially in the allied sector however women’s role is grossly underestimated and undervalued. Their role includes various activities such as milking of the cattle, churning of cream to get butter and preparation of by-products of milk (such as lassi, cheese, curd).
Now-a-days, switching to dairy farming (an entrepreneurial venture) is need of the hour. Keeping in view, Smt. Kamalpreet Kaur, w/o S. Inderjeet Singh, a 45 year old lady decided to join hands with the dairy department for the revival of the Traditional occupation of her in-laws on commercial basis with the latest technology.
