Black Gram Cultivation with New Technology

Introduction


Smt.Tapasi Patra and several other practicing farmer and farm women of Ruppur village, Bolpur, Santiniketan had undergone skill development training programmes on crop diversification through introduction of pulses during Kharif season 2019-20 organized by Rathindra KVK, Palli Siksha Bhavana, Visva-Bharati, Sriniketan in Birbhum District of .

Source of Motivation

y Smt. Patra after skill development training programmes had shown interest on pulse cultivation during kharif instead of kharif paddy. y She encouraged other fellow farmers to become the partner farmers in the Cluster Front Line Demonstration Programme on Kharif Pulses viz. Black gram, 2019-20 conducted by KVK, Birbhum in their village.

Technology and Innovation Adopted


Farmers of Ruppur village generally grow Kali-50 (old variety) variety of black gram. They do not adopt any new technology and they have no idea about use of any micronutrients and herbicides.
They hardly apply any fertilizers for black gram cultivation.
Scientists of KVK, Birbhum motivated the farmers to adopt the latest technology of Black gram cultivation during kharif and accordingly conducted the CFLD in the village during 2019-20. The following practices were advocated and inputs provided by the KVK
Use of seeds of Improved Variety WBU-109 @ 30 kg/ha
Method of seed sowing: - Broadcasting
Application of herbicides Pendimethalin @ 3 L / ha at 1- 3 days after sowing.
Foliar Spray of Micro-Nutrients: B-20 @ 2 gm. / L of water at 25 and 45 days after sowing.

Contributing Factors


The demonstrated variety WBU-109 is a short duration and takes 15-20 days less than the existing variety i.e. Kali-50.
Average no. of branches of the demonstrated variety was also more by 6-8 numbers than the Kali-50 variety. The number of pods per plant was 60-65 in the demonstrated variety whereas in the case of the existing variety, it was only 30-35 in numbers.
The shiny black colour of the seeds of WBU-109 is very much attractive and fetches higher remuneration in market.

Influence on the Other Farmers


The demonstration plots attracted the attention of many farmers for its good crop stand and a bumper harvest. It is expected that people would adopt this improved/new technology to boost pulse production.
