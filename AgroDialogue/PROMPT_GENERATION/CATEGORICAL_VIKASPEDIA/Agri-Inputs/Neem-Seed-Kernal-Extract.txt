Water (reasonably good quality) – 100 litres
Detergent - 200 g 
Muslin cloth for filtering

Methodology
Take required quantity of Neem seed kernel (5 kg )
Grind the kernels gently to powder it

Things to be taken care
Collect the Neem fruits during bearing season and air-dry them under shade.
Do not use the seeds over eight months of age. The seeds stored over and above this age lose their activity and hence not fit for NSKE preparation.
Always use freshly prepared neem seed kernel extract (NSKE).
Spray the extract after 3.30 pm to get effective results.

Preparing Spray solution
Neem Kernel extracts (500 to 2000 ml) is required per tank (10 liters capacity). 3-5 kg of neem kernel is required for an acre. Remove the outer seed coat and use only the kernel. If the seeds are fresh, 3 kg of kernel is sufficient. If the seeds are old, 5 kg are required. 
Pound the kernel gently and tie it loosely with a cotton cloth. Soak this overnight in a vessel containing 10 litre of water. After this, it is filtered. 
On filtering, 6-7 litre of extract can be obtained. 500-1000 ml of this extract should be diluted with 9 ½ or 9 litres of water. Before spraying khadi soap solution @ 10 ml/litre should be added to help the extract stick well to the leaf surface. This concentration of the extract can be increased or decreased depending on the intensity of pest attack
