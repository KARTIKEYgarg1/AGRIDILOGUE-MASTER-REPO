National Certification System for Tissue Culture raised plants

Plant tissue culture technology has played a pivotal  role in revolutionizing the growth of agriculture  worldwide by large scale clonal multiplication  of various economically important plant species. The Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India in 2005 evolved a  National  Certification System for Tissue Culture Raised  Plants (NCS-TCP), in consultation with Ministry  of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, to provide support to the tissue  culture industry for propagation and distribution  of virus-free and quality tissue culture raised  plants to growers/farmers.

DBT was notified  as the Certification Agency for certification of  tissue culture raised plants vide Gazette of India  Notification No. F. No. 18-28/202-SD.IV dated March  10, 2006 under Section 8 of the Seeds Act, 1966  (54 of 1966) issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare.  Gradually, NCS-TCP has become National level  mandated activity for tissue culture industry  sector in India.

Recognition/Renewal of Recognition of Tissue  Culture Production Facilities
Eligibility Criteria for Recognition of  Tissue Culture Production Facilities 

Any Tissue Culture Production Facility  (Public sector, Private sector, NGO and  others) engaged in production of Tissue  Culture Plants with minimum production  capacity of 0.5 million (5 Lakhs) plants  per annum. 
Tissue culture production facility should  be fully operational (including all areas of  laboratory and hardening facility) at the  time of application and site visit. 

Process of Recognition/Renewal of Recognition of  Tissue Culture Production Facilities (TCPFs)

Application form for Recognition/Renewal of  Recognition is available at  .  The NCS-TCP Management Cell (NMC) would adhere to time frame for site visit  of Accreditation Panel for Recognition/ Renewal of  Recognition of TCPFs i.e  30 working days from the  time of complete application from TCPFs. In case  of non-conformities, verification visit would be  organized within30 working days day after formal  communication from TCPFs of their corrective  actions and receipt of verification visit fee.

Renewal of Recognition: Noteworthy facts 
Application for renewal of Recognition  should ideally be submitted  3 months  prior to the date of expiry of the  “Certificate of Recognition”. Renewal fee  registration fee of Rs. 250/- (Rupees two  hundred and fifty only) to be deposited  in NCS-TCP centralized account  mentioned in the application form and  particulars of transfer to be submitted  along with application form
NMC will not be responsible for any  delay in the renewal of Recognition,  if complete application has not been  submitted by TCPFs 3 months prior to  expiry of Certificate 
If the complete Application of Renewal  (NCS-TCP Form- 2A) is not received  1 month prior to the expiry of their  “Certificate of Recognition” the company  will be asked apply for fresh Recognition  in NCS-TCP Form-2.
Renewal of Recognition would be  granted to those TCPFs who are  undertaking Certification of every batch  of tissue culture raised plants 

Certification of Tissue Culture Plants

Eligibility Criteria for Certification of Tissue  Culture Raised Plants
The Tissue Culture Production Facility  (TCPF) must be Recognized under NCS- TCP.  Accredited Test Laboratories (ATLs)  would accept samples for certification  only from Recognized TCPFs

Requirements for Certification of Tissue  Culture Raised Plants 
The mother plant tissue/stock culture  must be tested for freedom from all  known viruses from ATLs or any reputed  Government institutions. To get the list of ATLs  established under NCS-TCP, .
The respective batch (lot) of tissue  culture plants should be derived from  tested stock culture as stated above.
Recognized TCPFs should assign 4 digits  batch number  to the said batch of tissue  culture plants. This above number should  be provided to ATLs while sending  samples for certification.
Tissue culture raised plants ready  to dispatch to the farmers (ideally  secondary hardened) will be tested for all  known viruses and true to type in order  to certify under NCS-TCP 

Procedures and relevant forms to be used for  “Batch Certification of Tissue Culture Raised  Plants” 
The Recognized TCPF should sent an  intimation form (Virus/ genetic fidelity)  Testing for Batch Certification of Tissue  Culture Raised Plants to the ATL in a specified format given  at  
The ATL would send an  Acknowledgement to the TCPF providing  details of requisite fee to send the  Application form/samples. 
On receipt of acknowledgement, sample  would be drawn as per the sampling  strategy given below (samples would be  drawn either by representative of ATL  or TCPF itself as per the mutual consent  and coordination between TCPF and ATL)
The requisite fee to be deposited at  centralized NCS-TCP account mentioned  in the application form. 
Samples for certification would be  sent to ATL along with the duly filled  Application for Testing for Batch  Certification of Tissue Culture Raised  Plants along with  particulars of transfer.
