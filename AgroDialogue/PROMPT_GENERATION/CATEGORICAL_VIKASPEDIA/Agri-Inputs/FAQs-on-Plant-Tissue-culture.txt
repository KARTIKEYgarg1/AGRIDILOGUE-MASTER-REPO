FAQs on Plant Tissue culture


What is Plant Tissue Culture?
It is the process of producing plants from  tissues of the desired plant in an artificial nutrient medium under  controlled environment. The plants so produced would be exactly similar  to the mother plant in all aspects.

What is totipotency?
Totipotency is a characteristic feature of a  plant cell which signifies that a single cell is capable of giving rise  to the whole plant i.e. the cell has the inherited capacity of  differentiation and dedifferentiation. The term was first coined by  Habertland in 1902.

How plant tissue culture/ micro propagation is done ?
A  small  piece  of  plant  tissue  (explant)  is  taken  fr om  the  donor  plant  and  cultured   on   a   nutrient   medium   in   sterile   containers.   By   altering   the  composition  of  the  medium  and  the  environmental  conditions  (temperature,  light  regime,  etc.)  the  development  of  this  piece  of  tissue  can  be  directed  along  different  patterns  and  finally  the  whole  plant  can  be  regenerated.  The  offspring comes from a single plant and are thus identical to each other and to  the mother plant.

Why one should go for tissue culture plants?
Tissue culture plants are qualitatively better as they are produced  under aseptic condition and controlled environment. One should go for  tissue culture plants for the following reasons.

Tissue culture raised plants are vigorous and fast growing than conventional plants.
High degree of uniformity than the conventionally produced plants.
The tissue culture plantlets are free from diseases/pathogens.
It is possible to multiply plants that are difficult to propagate by cuttings or other traditional methods.
Tissue culture plants yield better as they are produced under optimum environment from selected mother plants.

What is an explant? What are the types of explants used in Plant Tissue Culture?
An explant is the part of a plant which has got  the regeneration potential and is capable to give rise to the whole  plant. There are various types of explants frequently used for  regeneration purpose: nodal segments, apical meristems, roots,  cotyledons, embryo, leaf disc, leaf blade, pedicle, petiole, anther,  ovary etc.

What are the crops being propagated by Plant Tissue Culture commercially?
Banana,  Sugarcane, Potato, Bamboo, Ginger, Apple, , Citrus, Vanilla,  Anthurium, Teak, Strawberry, Lillium, Cardamom, Mangium, Gerbera, Fig,  Jatropha, Carnation, Grape, Turmeric, Orchids etc. are comely used for  large scale production for domestic as well as export market.

Whether tissue culture plants are more prone to pest and diseases than plants propagated conventionally?
The tissue culture raised plants are free  from disease and pest, if the standard procedures are adopted for  production. Tissue culture plants grow faster and better, yet they are  as vulnerable as any other plants unless appropriate precautions are  taken. However, tissue culture plants are free from soil borne diseases.

Do tissue culture plants yield better than the conventional plants?
As tissue culture plants are uniform, vigorous and  disease free, if proper cultivation practices are properly followed,  the total yield is expected to be better compared to conventional  plants.

What is a mother plant?
Mother plant is the source of explants to be  used for further multiplication. (*Note: That the mother plant should be  devoid of any bacterial/fungal infections before using for  multiplication).

What are the constituents of plant tissue culture nutrient media?
The components of plant tissue culture nutrient media are:  Water, Inorganic salts, Plant growth  regulators, Vitamins, Amino acids, Carbon sources and Solidifying agents  (in case of a solid medium).

How do plant growth regulators affect plant morphogenesis in culture?
Two plant growth regulators affect plant differentiation: 
Auxins: Stimulate root development 
Cytokinins: Stimulates shoot development 
Generally, the ratio of these two hormones can  determine plant development: 
Auxin> cytokinin = Root development 
Cytokinin> auxin = Shoot development 
Auxin = Cytokinin = Callus development

What is organogenesis?
Organogenesis: The process of initiation and development of a structure that shows natural organ form and/or function.

What is embryogenesis?
Embryogenesis: The process of initiation and   development of embryos or embryo-like structures from somatic cells  (somatic  embryogenesis).

What is the embryo rescue technique?
It is an in vitro technique in which the  embryo (resulting from a wide hybridization where fertilization  occurred, but embryo development did not occur) is cultured. Its merits are:
Rescues F1 hybrid  from a wide cross.
Overcomes seed  dormancy, usually with addition of hormone to media (GA).
Overcomes  immaturity in the seed.
To speed  generations in a breeding programme.
To rescue a cross or self (valuable genotype)  from a dead or dying plan 

What are the various stages of micropropagation?
Stage 0 â€“ Selection and preparation of the mother  plant Sterilization of the plant tissue takes place 
Stage I - Initiation of culture Explant placed into growth media 
Stage II - Multiplication Explant transferred to shoot media; shoots can  be constantly divided 
Stage III - Rooting Explant transferred to root media 
Stage IV - Transfer to soil Explant returned to soil; hardened off

What is an artificial seed?
Artificial  seeds are formed by  encapsulating the somatic embryos in 0.2% solution of  sodium alginate,  this solution forms a gel at later stages and acts as seed  coat, such  type of somatic embryos are called artificial seeds. Such embryos   (artificial seeds) are genetically identical and can be stored for long   durations before use.

What is photoautotrophic micropropagation?
Photoautotrophic  micropropagation is a phenomena in which a plant is grown under in vitro environment without the addition of carbon source in the medium. This  allows  autotrophic growth (increased photosynthetic efficiency) of the  plant which has  the advantage of better acclimatization under ex vitro condition than  conventional methods.

What are  the in vitro parameters affecting plant growth?
The in  vitro parameters affecting plant growth are: photoperiods (light and dark   cycles), temperature, carbon source, plant growth regulators, macro and  micro  nutrients, vitamins, water etc.

What are  the parameters affecting ex vitro growth of plants?
Parameters  affecting ex vitro growth of plants  are: temperature, light (quality/quantity), relative  humidity, soil  characteristic, soil nature etc. These biotic and  abiotic factors in  combination are responsible for overall growth and  development of plant.
