Chawki means the first two stages of silkworm rearing. If the chawki worms are not reared properly, the later stages will result in crop losses. Hence, chawki is the most crucial period of silkworm rearing that demands optimum temperature and humidity, hygienic conditions, quality tender leaf, good rearing facilities and above all technical skills.

Commercial Chawki Rearing Centres
A commercial Chawki Rearing Model was established at CSRTI, Mysore with the capacity to brush 1, 60, 000 dfls (disease-free-layings) per annum @ 5000 dfls per batch for 32 batches in a year. After testing this model successfully for 2 years, the same model has been popularized in major silk growing areas of the country.
