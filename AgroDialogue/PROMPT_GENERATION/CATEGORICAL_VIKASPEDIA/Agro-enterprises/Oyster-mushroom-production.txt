Spawn (Mushroom Seeding)

Tie one end of bag, put two holes of 1 cm dia in the middle.
Put handful of cooked straw in the bag to a height of 5 cm; sprinkle about 25 g of spawn.
Layer the straw to 25 cm height. Repeat the process to get four layers of spawn and 5 layers of straw.
Tie the mouth and arrange beds in tiers in the spawn running room.
After 15-20 days, cut and remove the polythene bag and transfer the beds to cropping room.
