The State of the World’s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture

The State of the World’s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture is a publication of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)of the United Nations.

The 2019 report presents the first global assessment of biodiversity for food and agriculture (BFA).  It  complements  other  global  assessments  prepared  under  the  auspices  of  the  Commission  on  Genetic  Resources  for  Food  and  Agriculture.

Scope of the report

The  State  of  the  World’s  Biodiversity  for  Food  and  Agriculture  (SoW-BFA)  addresses  the  sustainable use, development and conservation of BFA worldwide. BFA is taken to include the diversity of animals, plants and micro-organisms at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels  that  sustain  structures,  functions  and  processes  in  and  around  production  systems  and provide food and non-food agricultural products.

The report draws on  information provided in 91 country reports, 27 reports from international organizations and inputs from over 175 authors and reviewers.

Key findings

Biodiversity is essential to food and agriculture: Biodiversity for food and agriculture is indispensable to food security, sustainable development and the supply of many vital ecosystem services. 

Multiple  interacting  drivers  of  change  are  affecting  biodiversity  for  food  and agriculture : While a range of drivers of change are having major negative impacts on biodiversity for food  and  agriculture  and  the  ecosystem  services  it  delivers,  some  provide  opportunities  to promote more sustainable management.

Biodiversity for food and agriculture is declining : Many  key  components  of  biodiversity  for  food  and  agriculture  at  genetic,  species  and  ecosystem levels are in decline. Knowledge  of  associated  biodiversity,  in  particular  micro-organisms  and  invertebrates,  and of its roles in the supply of ecosystem services needs to be improved. Monitoring programmes for biodiversity for food and agriculture remain limited.

The use of many biodiversity-friendly practices is reported to be increasing : The  sustainable  use  and  conservation  of  biodiversity  for  food  and  agriculture  call  for  approaches  in  which  genetic  resources,  species  and  ecosystems  are  managed  in  an  integrated way in the context of production systems and their surroundings. The use of a wide range of management practices and approaches regarded as favourable to the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity for food and agriculture is reported to be increasing. Although  efforts  to  conserve  biodiversity  for  food  and  agriculture  in  situ  and  ex  situare  increasing,  levels  of  coverage  and  protection  are  often  inadequate. 

Enabling frameworks for the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity for food and agriculture remain insufficient : Enabling  frameworks  for  the  sustainable  use  and  conservation  of  biodiversity  for  food  and  agriculture  urgently  need  to  be  established  or  strengthened.


What needs to be done
Securing  and  enhancing  the  multiple  roles  of  BFA  will  require  sustainable  use  and  conservation  of  the  ecosystems,  species  and  genetic  diversity  that  compose  it.  For  this  to  happen, knowledge of the roles of biodiversity in the ecological processes that underpin food and agricultural production needs to be strengthened, and used to develop management strategies  that  protect,  restore  and  enhance  these  processes  across  a  range  of  scales.  Establishing effective policy and outreach measures will be needed to support the uptake of management practices that sustainably use biodiversity to promote food and livelihood security and resilience.

The country-driven process of preparing The State of the World’s Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture has led to the identification of numerous gaps, needs and potential actions in the management of BFA. The next step is to take action. Over the years, the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture has overseen the development of global plans of action for genetic resources in the plant, animal and forest sectors. Implementation of these  instruments  needs  to  be  stepped  up.  Consideration  also  needs  to  be  given  to  how  the international community can more effectively promote synergies in the management of all components of biodiversity, across these sectors and others, in the interests of a more sustainable food and agriculture.
