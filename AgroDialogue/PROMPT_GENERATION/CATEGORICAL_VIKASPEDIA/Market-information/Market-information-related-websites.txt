National Agriculture Market (e-NAM)

National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) is a pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the existing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. The NAM Portal provides a single window service for all APMC related information and services. This includes commodity arrivals & prices, buy & sell trade offers, provision to respond to trade offers, among other services. While material flow (agriculture produce) continue to happen through mandis, an online market reduces transaction costs and information asymmetry.

Components of NAM

One license for a trader valid across all markets in the State.

AGMARKNET

To make farming communities benefit from the new global market access opportunities, the internal agricultural marketing system of the country is being integrated and strengthened. Various studies reveal that farmers, on an average, get a reasonably higher price by selling their produce in the regulated markets (Agricultural Produce Market Committees - APMCs) compared to rural, village and unregulated wholesale markets.

The Directorate of Marketing and Inspection (DMI) is successfully running an ICT project: NICNET based Agricultural Marketing Information System Network (AGMARKNET) in the country, for linking all important APMCs (Agricultural Produce Market Committees), State Agricultural Marketing Boards/ Directorates and DMI regional offices located throughout the country, for effective information exchange on market prices. National Informatics Centre (NIC) is the ICT agency behind the implementation of the Project.
