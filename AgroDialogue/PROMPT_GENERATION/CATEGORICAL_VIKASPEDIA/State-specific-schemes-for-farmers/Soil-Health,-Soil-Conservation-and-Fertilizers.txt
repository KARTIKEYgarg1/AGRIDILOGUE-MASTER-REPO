Soil Health, Soil Conservation and Fertilizers


What to Do?


Always use appropriate fertilizer in right quantity based on soil test.
Must use organic manures to maintain the fertility of soil.
In order to get maximum benefit of the fertilizers, always apply in root zone instead of broadcasting.
Resort to judicious and efficient use of Phosphatic Fertilizers for proper development of roots/shoots and timely maturity of crops, particularly the legumes which fix atmospheric Nitrogen for enrichment of soil.
For reclaiming acidic soil, use lime and for saline/usar soil, use gypsum.
Farmers desirous of adopting Participatory Organic Guarantee System (PGS – India) Certification system may form a group of at least 5 farmers and get it registered with the nearest Regional Council or Regional Centre of Organic Farming.
