Conservation bench terracing for south-eastern Rajasthan
Low and highly unstable crop production and rapidly falling groundwater levels are the major challenges to be tackled in semi-arid rainfed areas. In south-eastern Rajasthan, high intensity and erratic rains associated with poor soil permeability creates excessive runoff and severe erosion hazards. In this region, through Conservation Bench Terrace (CBT), farm-rainwater harvesting can be done.

In the CBT system, land is divided along the slope into 2:1 ratio. The lower 1/3rd area is levelled>  for collecting runoff from the upstream 2/3rd area, which is left in its natural slope. Upper 2/3rd area is cultivated during  kharif either with sorghum + pigeonpea intercropping or soybean. The lower 1/3rd levelled terraces are left fallow during monsoon and cultivated with mustard or gram during rabi. The cost of construction of CBT on 2% slope was about Rs 3,022/ha.
It was observed that through CBT,
21-29% of cropping season lost rainfall through surface runoff could be reduced to 13.4-15.8%.
Reduced water erosion from 3.8-11 tonnes/ha/yr to about 2.2-3.2 tonnes/ha/yr
78.1% increase in grain and straw yields in terms of sorghum grain equivalent (SGE).
Benefit: cost ratio of the system was 1.4:1.
Benefits of soil and nutrients conservation

The CBT system can be successfully used in the semi-arid climate with mild slopes (2-5%) with sufficient soil depth for erosion control, moisture conservation and improvement of soil and crop productivity.
