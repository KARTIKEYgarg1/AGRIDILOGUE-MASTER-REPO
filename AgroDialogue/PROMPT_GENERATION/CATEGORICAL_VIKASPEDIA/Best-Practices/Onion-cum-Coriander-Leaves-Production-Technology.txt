Description of innovation
Farmers grow onion as a sole crop, but Shri Kushwaha sowed one row of multi-cut coriander along the border of onion plot. He received 2-3 kg green coriander leaves from small size of 3mx4. plot. Thus, this combination harvest of 2.5 to 4.0 tonnes/ha as companion crop with onion gave an additional income of Rs 15,000/ ha.

Practical utility of innovation
There is shortage of coriander leaves in the market during late winter. Thus growing of multi-cut coriander hybrid variety along with the border of onion beds can successfully give the 2.5 to 4.0 tonnes of leaves/ha without hampering growth of main crop. This innovation provides additional income without involving much cost. This is an ideal example of getting recurring benefit with amicable adjustment of companion crop without affecting profitability of main crop.
