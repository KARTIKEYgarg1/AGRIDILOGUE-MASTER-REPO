Pashu Sakhi - An alternative livestock extension approach

With access to knowledge and inputs, the goat rearers of Gondia district in Maharashtra are able to make a decent livelihood with goat rearing. A community based alternative extension system which is women centric, has also brought out a positive change in the lives of women and in the communities.

The Challenge
Small livestock, like goat, sheep, pig and poultry is a critical  source of livelihoods for rural poor, especially for women, in  developing and underdeveloped countries, including India. Small  livestock are perceived to have several benefits. According to field  studies, small livestock serve as a source of income, as assets which  could be encashed in times of emergency, as source of nutrition (milk  and meat), as a source of medicine (milk), and as gifts during  ceremonies.

One of the many problems that the livestock farmers have been facing  is high mortality and morbidity of animals. High mortality and morbidity  of goats leads to economic, social and mental stress, making rural  households highly vulnerable. Women are the worst sufferers of such  tragedies owing to their high involvement with small livestock. Also,  they take care of ailing animals, which consumes significant time and  energy. Families try to cope with such loss of livestock by selling food  grains. In extreme cases, it may lead to even stopping child education  and opting for long distance migration. Several other challenges for  livestock farmers are genetic degradation of goats, feed scarcity,  seasonal stress, absence of transparent system of price estimation of  goats, inefficient trading, high costs of aggregation and low adoption  of information technology. Besides, lack of access to timely, low cost,  door step livestock health care, first aid and knowledge support has  been a key constraint in livestock production.

Pashu Sakhis - community led livestock extension service
Responding to such a situation, an alternative community led  livestock extension service mechanism has been tried and promoted.  Through this community based approach, women are empowered through  technical training and hand holding support to take lead in generating  demand for inputs and provide services to livestock farmers. By building  their capacities and providing hand holding support, over 4712 Pashu Sakhis (meaning friends of livestock) have been promoted in 16 Indian states  reaching to over 2.5 lakh small livestock farmers daily. The present  case is about a partnership initiative between Maharashtra State Rural  Livelihood Mission (MSRLM), Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahamandal (MAVIM) and  The Goat Trust, which promoted the alternative community based extension  approach in Gondia, a tribal dominated district in Maharshtra.

Uniqueness of approach
Alternative livestock extension services had been a felt need over  last five decades. Many experiments around promoting and nurturing such  service delivery mechanism had been tried at various points of time,  with limited success. Major shortcomings of existing programs were – the  trained rural youth responsible to cater to 8-15 villages often focused  on treatment, mostly on large livestock, rather than preventive  practices and awareness building. Conflicting interests resulted in the  neglect of small livestock and the poor farmers. Secondly, high costs of  travel resulted in the neglect of close monitoring and administering  first aid, which was in itself not lucrative for the youth. The trained  youth who were men most of the time, had a social and psychological  barrier in reaching women, who are the caretakers of livestock.

Based on learning from past limited success and some failure, an  alternative process was conceptualized and implemented on scale to  assess feasibility and impact of Pashu Sakhi model. In this initiative, semi literate women are trained as Pashu Sakhi.  Prior to training, the women are selected by the community, their roles  and responsibilities are briefed by involving the family heads. The  process is followed to enhance community ownership and family support  for effective functioning of Pashu Sakhi. Once nominated by  local goat farmers, a systematic orientation is organized, followed by 5  day residential training. A participatory training process adjusted  with the pace of learner, was evolved to have multiple training  methodologies around key knowledge, skills and attitudes required to  function as Pashu Sakhi.

Besides treatment, Pashu Sakhi training module focuses on management practices and sharing of best practices. Pashu Sakhis essentially are small livestock farmers and adopters of best practices,  rather than just propagators. This enhances knowledge and creditability  of Pashu Sakhi as a best practice propagator and local leadership.

Role of Pashu Sakhi
Pashu Sakhi performs three kind of complimentary functions –
Extension of improved practices and knowledge sharing,
providing door step first aid and counseling services for disease prevention and management and
Demonstration of best practices and enterprise management in her own house. 

Pashu Sakhis also work as monitoring and support service  provider for the project. They visit each goat house and assess the  condition. A regular monitoring on disease spread and decrease in  frequency of morbidity (disease) is kept through data analysis. They  provide critical feedback on adoption and suggest appropriate practice,  technology or input based on the relevance and feasibility.

Pashu Sakhis through awareness and training motivate farmers to adopt  good practices which boosts demand for new inputs. To meet the demand  locally, Pashu Sakhis are trained to take up entrepreneurial activities  too. In fact, Pashu Sakhis sustain on entrepreneurial  initiatives of input supply for goat farming rather than by providing  services alone (eg., providing treatment and first aid).

In a nut shell, Pashu Sakhi works more like an Anganwadi  worker and ANM in human health management. The only difference is that  here she becomes an input supplier, a self business promoter, and also a  service provider, making the system sustainable and more effective over  a period of time.

The result
In about twelve to eighteen months of the programme, positive impacts  were observed on two fronts. There has been significant decrease in  mortality of goats. Goat mortality dropped from 22% to 6%, which saved  nearly 8600 goats every year, thus generating over 51 million rupees.  Besides reduced morbidity, reduced kidding interval and better growth of  kids have collectively contributed Rs 25 million gain in goat farming.  This has been reflected in over 25% growth of goat population in last  one year. Further, farmers increased confidence resulted in further  investment in goat farming.

Field assessment study in Gondia has provided strong evidences on  improved knowledge, services, technology propagation and adoption by  goat farming families. There has been enhanced faith of the community in  managing risks. This in turn has enabled goat farmers to negotiate  enhanced price for their goats and bucks.

Pashu Sakhis earned Rs 800 to Rs 2000 as an additional  income by improving their goat rearing practices and by providing  services to others. By way of contributing to the family finances, these  women gained recognition in the household as well as in the community.  They were being recognized in the society as providers of critical  services.  Attitude of men towards women, especially from the higher  castes, has shown dramatic change for good. Pashu Sakhis are now being addressed with greater respect and affection, sometimes being referred to as “doctor didi” by villagers.

Way forward
The alternative community based extension model in Gondia district  was successful and sustainable. Factors like high density of small  livestock and lack of access to knowledge and basic services have played  a crucial role in the success of this model. The Goat Trust is now  exploring market opportunities, facilitating market linkages and  building the capacities of Pashu Sakhis in estimating and assessing live body weight pricing of small livestock. The model of Pashu Sakhi is being extended to other livestock too. It has been tried for  poultry, successfully. It is yet to be tested for large ruminants, on a  scale.
