Gujarat Gauseva Model
Gauseva and Gauchar Vikas Board, Government of Gujarat has developed the "Gujarat Gauseva Model" for care and management of stray and abandoned livestock and desi cows.

Importance of Desi / Indigenous cows
The indigenous cows are most capable to cope up in the Indian environment in relation to physical and physiological abilities. A Desi cow has ability to produce healthy ( A-2) milk at farmers door based on dry roughages like paddy and wheat straw. She converts such waste materials of crops into milk and manure.

Today, the biggest felon of the soil degradation is the indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The extensive use of chemical fertilizers had led to the depletion of the soil carbon; humus - the organic matter in the soil which is responsible for reduced soil fertility, per hectare yield and quality of farm products. In tropical countries like India, such problem is aggravated by the fact that the soil carbon contains 0.5 per cent against 4.5 per cent in cold countries.

According to an estimate, the cattle shed (Gaushala) manure/cow dung supplies nearly 10 times as much nitrogen and phosphoric acid to the soil as other manures and fertilizers. The amount of cattle dung annually available is 2100 million tonnes, of which 700 million tonnes is used as fuel and 320 million tonnes as manure; the balance is being wasted, if not properly utilized. It is cheaper and the remedy to all soil problems. Research studies have concluded that dung of a cow may give 1,460 tonnes micro-nutrients annually which is sufficient to enrich soil structure and fertility of 14.6 acres. Cow dung has played a major role in organic crop production.

Gauseva model
Gauseva and Gauchar Vikas Board, Govt. of Gujarat has identified 143 Gaushals/ Panjarapole in the State to launch 23 projects as model institutions to propagate the Gaushala advancement throughout State, towards their self-sufficiency by using of cow dung and urine for production of medicines, energy/electricity, bio-fertilizers, pesticides and other items of daily use. The Gujarat Govt. has launched 24 hrs. Ambulance Service ( toll free no.-1962) just like for human in the State for health care and management of Gaushala animals for emergency rescue.

The major work done for Gaushala Development in Gujarat State are as follows.
Establishment of new Gaushals (particularly in jails, schools &amp; temples),
Provide support for natural breeding of Deshi breeds (Giri, Kankrej and Dangi)
Offer scholarships on Gaushala research, Gau Vigyan courses in schools/colleges, emphasize on organic farming, Gaushala awareness in tribal areas, microchip for cows, Kamdhenu hostels in urban area, etc
Organise National and International conferences /seminars and workshops on Gaushala development to discuss the problems and challenges ahead.
Organise awareness and interaction programmes through cow exhibition, honoring Gaushala workers

Conclusion
The Gujarat Model Gauseva could be replicated throughout the country to save the cows and its progenies by making the Gaushalas self-sufficient. Such programmes will not only sustain the indigenous breed of cows but also support the economy of farmers by protecting the environment and ecosystem.
