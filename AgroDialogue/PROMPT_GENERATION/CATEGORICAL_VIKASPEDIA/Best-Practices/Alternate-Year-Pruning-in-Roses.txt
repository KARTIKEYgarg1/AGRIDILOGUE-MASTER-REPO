Description of innovation
Training and pruning of crop is one of the most important practices which influence flower production significantly. In roses, this practice is recommended each year during mid December to mid January in which farmers get 120-140 q/ha flower yield per year. But Shri Gopal Krishna Saini has adopted an innovative practice of "alternate year pruning". In this practice, the crop is trained and pruned one year and kept unpruned in second year. Through this practice, second year crop gives higher number of branches and flowers. Shri Saini is achieving 120-130 q/ha flower yield in first year after pruning and 240- 260 q/ha yield in second year from this practice. The innovative practice has reduced the pruning cost and doubled the yield of flowers with additional economic gain of Rs. 2.70 to 3.00 lakh in two years.

Practical utility of innovation
This technology is cost effective and more remunerative in the areas like Kannauj where distillation of flowers is commercially done for extracting essence and its marketing. The farmers could save the money and increase his profit
