Description of innovation
Shri P. Subba Rao an innovative farmer diversified the crops like rice, cotton and chilli in red loamy soils having filter points as irrigation source to oil palm cultivation. Introduction of inter cropping with groundnut in oil palm facilitated him to achieve an additional income in the early stages of oil palm up to 5 years. He saved 30 per cent of irrigation water through drip irrigation. A substantial increase in girth of oil palm was observed while using vermicompost @ 50 kg/palm in two split doses at 6 months interval besides an increased yield of 20 per cent as compared to the farmers who applied chemical fertilizers.

Practical utility of innovation
Groundnut was grown as an inter crop in the early stages of oil palm up to 5 years using sprinkler irrigation. An average yield of 30 q/ ac was recorded. The additional income realised from groundnut helped the farmer to meet the expenditure towards maintenance of oil palm garden till the bearing of productive bunches. The innovative practice of inter cropping groundnut in oil palm motivated the farmers to raise other crops like chilli, vegetables in early stages of oil palm. Drip irrigation is adaptable and increases water use efficiency there by decreasing the cost of irrigation. The farmers can save 30 per cent of irrigation water besides fertigation. Weed infestation around the base of the palm was found to be low. An average yield of 8 t/ac was recorded as compared to flood irrigation (4-5 t/ac)done by other farmers. The residue of groundnut crop was used for the preparation of vermicompost. Application of 50 kg of vermicompost helped in increasing girth of the palm and weight of bunches. With the service and guidance rendered by Shri P. Subba Rao, Remalle village, Bapulapadu Mandal, Krishna District the oil palm cultivation has gone up to 3500 ha in red loamy soils of Krishna District under filter points.
