Egg buriers of ornamental fish


These species usually inhabit waters that dry up at some time of the year. The majority of egg burriers are annual Killifish, which lay their eggs in mud. The parents mature very quickly and lay their eggs before dying when the water dries up. The eggs remain in a dormant stage until rains stimulate hatching.

Commercially important candidate species

Description: The fish has an elongated body. The body colouration is pale yellowish, but the fins are slightly blue or orange.

Breeding and seed production

Among the egg barriers, Killi fish such as the Aplochelius panchax, A.lineatus, A.blochii are important species. They are shade sensitive, if any shade falls over the delicate area of the forehead, they go to the bottom of the tank and come to the surface after sometimes. They lay the eggs on the soft peat of the lower part of the tank. During drought conditions, the adults may die, but the fertilized eggs remain dormant until next rains.

A tank of 20 – 30 litres is used with fresh de-chlorinated water and a sponge filter. These fishes are kept in a tank for spawning mop to receive the eggs. If adult fishes are well fed, they may not release the eggs. Fry can be raised in the tank until they attain stockable size. They accept brine nauplii and infusoria with an addition of finely crumbled protein rich supplementary diet when they get little bigger.

In a well planted aquarium, they lay eggs in the leafy environment. They are good jumpers and hence are to be kept in a covered aquarium. Eggs are capable of remaining viable even in dry conditions and hatching takes place even after some weeks or even months when again placed in water. They rarely grow more than 3- 4 cm in total length and are short lived.
