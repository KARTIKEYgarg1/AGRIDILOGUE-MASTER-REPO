Fish Balls

There are several varieties of fish which do not command a ready market as fresh fish, but are comparable to many table fish in nutritive value and other attributes. One of the ways of ensuring effective utilisation of such fish is to process ready-to-serve or ready-to-cook value added `convenience' products, for which there already exists great demand from within the country as also from abroad. Fish ball is one such product prepared using fish mince and starch that can be processed as a coated product or as     a heat-processed product in a suitable fluid medium.

Method of preparation


Mix mince prepared from fish using a mechanical meat      bone separator after heading, gutting and washing thoroughly with 1 % salt      and 5% corn starch (if required, spices like garlic, ginger etc. can be      added). 
Prepare balls, 2-3 cm in diameter, from the resultant      mass and cook in boiling 1% brine for 5-10 minutes. 
 Cool the cooked balls after which      they are battered and breaded. 
Pack the balls preferably in thermoformed trays as such      or after flash frying in hot vegetable oil. 
Preserve by freezing and store at -18°C. 

Fish balls before and after frying

Though mince from different species of fish can be used for processing fish balls, threadfin bream (Nemipterus japonicus), Pallikora (Otolithus argenteusj and Barracuda (Sphyraena spp.) are found to yield satisfactory products. Mince from freshwater fishes such as Rohu (Labeo rohita) and Catla (Catla catla) also can be used. However, in such cases, the mince needs to be refined by passing through a mechanical strainer to get rid of the interstitial spines.

Ready-to -serve fish curry in flexible pouches

Fish curry processed in flexible pouches is a product of great value these days. In the existing method, metal cans are used as containers.

Disadvantages of existing storage containers for ready-to-serve fish curry


Metal cans impart an undesirable taste to the product      on storage 
Metal cans are not economical to use in India 
There is likelihood of leaks from containers if the      metal containers are not strong 
Flexible pouches used are not heat stable and have      various other disadvantages 

Improved method of packaging ready-to-serve fish curry


Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) has      developed a suitable three-layer configuration of flexible pouches for      packaging ready-to-eat fish curry. 
This is a retortable flexible pouch based on Polyesters      Aluminium foil/Cast polypropylene. 
These flexible pouches are manufactured in India      employing the configuration developed by CIFT. 
CIFT has standardised the process for the production of      fish curry in these pouches using over pressure autoclave. The curry      processed in this way has remained without any change for over a year at      room temperature.
