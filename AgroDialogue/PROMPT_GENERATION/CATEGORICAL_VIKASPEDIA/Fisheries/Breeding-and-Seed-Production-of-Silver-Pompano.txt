Breeding and Seed Production of Silver Pompano


Introduction

The Silver Pompano, Trachinotus blochii, is a tropical species and usually distributed around the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the Family Carangidae and lives in the coral reef areas of less than 7 m depth. The juveniles inhabit sandy shorelines and shallow sandy or muddy bays near river mouths while adults move out in schools to clear seaward coral and rock reefs. Juveniles are in small schools, while adults are usually solitary. Adults feed primarily on sand molluscs and other hard-shelled invertebrates.

It is a well-recognized promising species for mariculture due to its taste, adaptability to culture environment, acceptability to formulated diet, good meat quality and international market demand. The  shape,  colouration  and  meat  quality  of   this fish is comparable with silver pomfret. The silver pompano is caught sporadically in commercial fishing as its availability from nature is scare. The farming can be successfully carried out in ponds, tanks  and floating sea cages. The species is pelagic, very active  and is able to acclimatize and grow well even at a lower  salinity  of  about  10  ppt  and  hence  is  suitable  for  farming   in the vast low saline waters of our country besides its  potential for sea cage farming. In India, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute has done extensive work on farming of silver pompano.

Brood stock development

Broodstock management plays an imperative role in the success of seed production. Broodstock is recruited from cultured stock at the floating net cages/ brood stock tanks. The fish that are selected for broodstock should be weighing about 1 kg, having no abnormalities and the body should be proportionally balanced.

Broodstock is conditioned through regulation of photo-thermal period and also by providing high nutritional feed including trash fish, pellets, vitamins and multi vitamins mixed at about 3-5% of the total body weight to accelerate the gonadal development. Water quality management is vital to succeed in production. The water exchange is about 400% in 24 hours, and water quality parameters such as pH 7.4-7.8, DO 4-6 ppm, water temperature 29-31°C and salinity at 30-32 ppt are maintained.

Spawning technique

The suggested breeding tank should have the capacity 10 m3, and 10 fishes are allowed in that tank with a sex ratio of 1:1 male to female. Normally, the male brooder is smaller than the females. The spawning pattern of silver pompano does not follow monthly lunar cycles. The hormonal treatment stimulates spawning, and no natural breeding takes place. However, the gonadal maturation of silver pompano is evaluated by cannulation biopsy of intra-ovarian eggs. Once the intra-ovarian eggs attain above 500µm, fishes are induced to spawn by using hormones such the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). The administered of HCG on dorsal muscle is used at the single dosage of 350IU/kg of body weight for the male and female. Spawning occurs between 2 or 3 days after hormone injection. Typically, it takes place between late night and early morning hours and egg release about 50000 to 150000 eggs with size ranged about 800 to 850 μm in size. The fertilized eggs are transparent and unfertilized eggs are opaque; however, the fertilized eggs are floating and are collected by scooping with 500μm mesh size net. The collected eggs are stocked in the incubation tank of 3 – 5 tonnes with a stocking density of 5 – 20 eggs/litre of water. The hatching rate takes places from 18 to 24hrs ranges between 65 – 75 percent.

Larval and fingerlings rearing

The fertilized collected eggs are stocked in the tank of 3 – 5 tonnes with a stocking density of 5 – 20 eggs/litre of water. The hatching rate takes places from 18 to 24hrs ranges between 65 – 75 percent. Initially, the Nannochloropsis sp or Isochrysis sp. are added to the larval rearing tank to maintain the green water system. The tank bottom is siphoned after 10 – 12 days to remove the organic debris, feed waste and dead organisms including fish to maintain the water quality parameters. It is practiced based on the water quality parameter and amount of waste deposited on tank bottom, normally once or twice in a week. The larvae are fed with rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, on 3rd day to 10th day, it is maintained in tank 5 – 15 individual/ml and given thrice in a day. The Artemia nauplii is given as feed about 8th day to 20th day while weaning feed (350μm) offered in 17th day. Around 25th day, the harvest is carried out; size grading should be done. However, anticipated survival is 20 – 25 percent.

The nursery rearing is initiated at 25–30 DPH, at this stage it is fed with an artificial floating diet of 800μm size. The stocking density is 20 individuals/litre, and the water exchange is maintained about 200 percent. A frequent siphoning is required to maintain the water quality parameters in optimum level. In addition to this, water quality parameters the temperature, pH, oxygen level and ammonia should be closely monitored entire larval rearing period. The floating pellet is provided, it varies with the size of fish mouth. Grading should be done to reduce the mortality. An average growth of silver pompano reaches 1mm/day. At 55 DPH fingerlings reach the size of 2.5 – 3.8 cm, which is ready grow in the floating cages. The fingerlings stocking density is 0.5 individual/ litre of water. The survival rate of 21 percent is anticipated. In addition to this, for packing, the water temperature should be maintained at 25°C - 27°C and the ratio of water and oxygen is 1:3 at 200 fingerlings/bag.

Grow-out culture

CMFRI Experiences of farming in various systems

T. blochii can be reared in cages, ponds and pens. In India, the CMFRI has undertaken farming trials in freshwater ponds, brackish water ponds, and cages installed in the sea. Among all methods, farming of silver pompano in low saline brackish water ponds yielded good harvest. The experiences gained through farming in various systems are given below:


Earthen pond farming in freshwater (zero salinity) was first attempted in a freshwater fish farm located in Akkiveedu Village, West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India. A sum of 3000 fingerlings was stocked in  0.4 ha pond of 2.5 - 3.0 cm length and 1.5 - 2.0 g were stocked in weight. The fishes were fed with floating pellet feed (32 percent protein and 6 percent fat). Fishes were reared for 240 days and they attained an average weight of 250 - 300g with the survival rate of 45 percent.
Earthen pond farming in brackish water (low salinity) was first attempted in a brackish water fish pond located in Anthervedhi Village, West Godavari district of India. A sum of 3000 fingerlings was stocked in  0.4 ha pond of 2.5 - 3.0 cm length and 1.5 - 2.0 g in weight. The fishes were fed with floating pellet feed (32 percent protein and 6 percent fat). Fishes were reared for 240 days and they attained an average weight of 450 - 500g with the survival rate of 94 percent. This has created tremendous interest among the brackish water shrimp farmers to grow Silver pompano as an alternative species for shrimps in their abandoned farms, which were hit by frequent outbreaks of diseases.
Open sea cage farming was attempted in the Gulf of Mannar side of Vedalai Village, Ramanathapuram District, Tamil Nadu, India. A sum of 4000 fingerlings was stocked in the happa (10 m × 10 m) of 2.5 - 3.0 cm length and 1.5 - 2.0 g in weight. When it reached about 25g, the fishes were shifted into the 4 m × 4 m × 3 m size happa.The fishes were fed with chopped lower market value species. Fishes were reared for 240 days and they attained an average weight of 250 - 275 g with a survival rate of 72 percent.

Culture of Silver Pompano in  coastal aquaculture ponds

Pond Preparation 

The pond has to be dried properly until the cracks appear  on the surface. The top layer of the soil containing waste  accumulated through previous crop of fish or shrimp has to  be removed. Ploughing has to be done to tilt the soil below  30 cm. Feeding areas, corners and side ditches in the pond  have to be properly tilled and dried to avoid formation of  black soil. The average water pH of 7.5-8.5 would be ideal  for pompano farming. The level of lime application during  pond preparation depends on the pH of the soil. Hence,  the dosage has to be calculated accordingly. Water filling  has to be initiated by covering the inlet pipe by using 2  layers of fine nets (100  μ ) to avoid introducing other fishes  and  predators.  A  week  before  stocking,  the  pond  must   be fertilized with either organic or inorganic fertilizers to  stimulate the plankton bloom.

Salinity 

Silver pompano can tolerate vide range of salinities from  5- 40 ppt. However, ideal salinity for farming would be  between 15 – 25 ppt. Pond has to be filled with a minimum  water level of 100 cm prior to stocking of fish seeds.  During  the  entire  culture  period  minimum  of  1.5  meter   water depth has to be maintained.

Nursery Rearing and Seed Stocking 

Hatchery produced pompano fingerlings of 1 inch size can  be stocked in happas/ pens of 2 meter length, 2.0 meter  width  and  1.5  meter  depth.  In  each  happa  about  200   fingerlings can be stocked. While stocking care should be  taken to avoid agitation of the pond bottom  and too many  persons getting into the pond may increase the suspended  solid  load  in  the  water,  which  may  cause  gill  chocking  of   the fish fingerlings leading to  mortality. Initially the fishes  have to be reared in happas for 60 days or until they attain  10 – 15 grams size and thereafter it can be released into  the  pond.  The  mesh  size  of  the  happa  could  be  initially   at 4 mm size and it can be changed with 8mm mesh size  happas after 30 days. The stocking density in happa could be maintained as 200  nos/ happa. After attaining 30 grams size ideally  5,000 Nos. can be stocked in a one acre pond.

Nutritional Requirement and Feeding 

Silver pompano is a fast moving marine fish and it requires  highly nutritive feed to meet the energy requirements.  During  nursery  rearing  pompano  can  be  weaned  to   any  type  of  feeds   viz. extruded floating pellet, sinking  pellet feed and chopped trash fishes. Ideally pompano  can be weaned to extruded floating pellet feed to avoid  feed  wastage  and  spoilage  of  pond  bottom.  CMFRI  has   conducted pompano farming demonstration by using the  extruded floating pellet feed manufactured by M/s. Rudhra  Techno Feeds, Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh. During the  happa  rearing  phase,  feeding  has  to  be  done  4  times  a   day  and  in  pond  culture  phase  it  could  be  3  times  a  day.

Floating feeding zones made of 3 inch size PVC floats of 2  meter length and 2 meter width has to be installed in the  ponds. Feed has to be dispensed inside the feeding zone  to avoid dispersal of floating feeds due to wind. At least  4 – 6 nos. of feeding zones have to be created in a one  acre pond. The feed size should be lesser than the mouth  size of the fish and hence, suitable sized feed has to be  selected for feeding the fishes.  The details of feed and  feeding schedule of pompano are as follows:-





A  mix  of  two  sizes  of  feed  pellet  can  be  used  if  there  is   any size variation of the fishes found during the regular  sampling. If sinking pellet feed is used, at least 4 – 8 feed  trays (80 cm x 80 cm) per pond could be placed.  Regular  sampling of fishes once in 15 days has to be carried out  to  determine  growth  rate  and  to  calculate  the  FCR.  In   the first farming demonstration, FCR was 1: 1.8 with the  above formulations.

Water Quality Management

Plankton bloom is essential for early stages of  pompano (until 100 grams) culture. If the color of  the pond water is clear a mixture of organic (10-30  kg./ha.) and inorganic fertilizers (1-3 kg./ha.) can  be applied to obtain algal bloom. Sufficient water  level must be maintained in the ponds to reduce  risks  of  the  growth  of  benthic  algae.  The  water   depth  in  the  shallowest  part  of  the  pond  should   be  at  least  100  cm.  Water  quality  can  be  maintained by exchanging 10% of the water once in a  week; 20% per week after 3 months and 30% per  week after 6 months. If water colour is too dark,  the  quantum  of  water  exchange  can  be  proportionately increased. To maintain water pH within  an optimum range of 7.5 - 8.5, agri-lime has to be applied  regularly.  Dissolved  oxygen  (D.O)  level   should  be  maintained  above  5  ppm  at  all  times.   Paddle wheel aerators can be placed in the pond  to create minor water current and to maintain the  DO level. Aeration is a must during late evening  to early morning period when the fishes attains  200 grams size and above.

Health Management

Silver pompano is a much hardier species and does not get  much disease problems. When it is reared in high salinities  parasitic  infection  of  copepods  may  occur.  Periodical   application of commercially available pond management  chemicals  like  Iodine  solution  would  help  to  keep  the   fi shes healthier. Feed supplements like LIV- 52 syrup can  be given by mixing with the feed to improve the immunity  levels.

Harvesting

Harvesting of silver pompano could be carried out by using  drag net as in the case of fresh water fishes. To maintain  the freshness and quality of harvested fish, washing in  clean water and chill killing can be done. Harvested fishes  can be stocked in plastic crates by adding layers of ice in  equal quantities at the bottom and top of the fish. It is  suggested that harvesting of fish can be carried out during  the off season period of April to June to get a better price. In the domestic  market,  silver  pompano  has  demand  starting from 250 grams size onwards.
