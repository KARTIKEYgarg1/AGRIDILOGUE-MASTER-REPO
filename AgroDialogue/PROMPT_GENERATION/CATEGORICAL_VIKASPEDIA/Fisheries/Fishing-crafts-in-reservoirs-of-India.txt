Fishing crafts in reservoirs of India


The floating and movable platforms used for fishing operation on which the fishers operate the fishing gears are called crafts. Generally, the coracle, catamaran, dingy, and country boats are used to capture the fishes from the reservoirs. These are generally small, wooden, nonmechanised and transported easily to remote areas.

Fishing crafts used in reservoirs

Coracle

Coracles  are light  in  weight,  bowl  shaped  boats  with  a  frame  of  woven  grass,  reeds,  or  saplings  covered  with  hides. Over  the  years,  these  circular  crafts  were  constructed  by  interwoven  strips  of  bamboo and covered with water proof materials such as plastic bags coated with a layer of coal tar. The boat size ranges between 1.50 – 2.00 meters dia. The coracle weight ranges between 10 – 15kg. A single oar is used to propel the coracle. Two fishers conduct the fishing in a coracle. Gillnet and long line are the common fishing methods. Apart from being simple and inexpensive, these are durable (2 – 3 years) and have good movability in all water bodies. It is profoundly used in ,  and Karnataka.

Float with sealed tins or Plastic cans

The fishers use the empty ordinary plastic cans or oil cans with 5 – 10 L capacity. Two cans are tied together using a piece of rope, the distance between the two cans is about one feet. While fishing, these are placed between the legs - one in the front and another in the backside. The upper portion of the body remains above the water and fishers are able to operate the net and paddle for some distance. Typically, this kind of craft is operated in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.

Catamarans

It is made of wooden logs (3 – 5 nos.), which are tied with ropes. The oar and sail are use to propel the catamarans. The pair boat is used for seine net operation; individual boats are used to operate the longline and cast netting. These are locally called Teppa in Tamil Nadu and chalathadi in Kerala.

Canoe

It  is  made  by  hallowing  out  of  a  single  palm  tree  of  varying  sizes  of  6-10m  long  and  2ft  wide.    One  end  of  this  is  bulbous and wide and the other end is narrow. It  is  propelled  by  Oar.  Traps,  cast  nets,  gill  nets   are  operated  from these canoes with a crew of one person in the  reservoir.

Dinghy

It is the most popular fishing craft in  and . It is plank-built, flat-bottomed canoe, 2 – 3m in length and 0.6 – 0.7m in width. The other, less common variety is the Bengal type dinghy, which is 5 – 7m in length. It has the additional facility for setting sails for wind propulsion. 2 – 3 fishers operate each boat.

Hodi

The traditional fishing boat of Car Nicobar,  Hodi  is  operated in the near shore waters. These boats cannot  be operated in the high seas due to small size, lack of  mechanization and sophisticated equipments and poor  endurance,  stability  and  storing  capacity.  They  are  propelled  by  means  of  oar  and  outriggers  which  are  slender  poles  secured  at  their  inner  ends  by  being  passed through the holes on the sides of dugout canoe  close to the edge. The  length of  the hodis  usually varies from 3 to 9 m, breadth 0.30 to 1.0 m and depth  from  0.40  to  1.0  m.
