Spoilage of fish products


Moulds and fungus

Fungus usually grows well on unsalted and salted dried fish, which has high moisture, content. Moulds usually grow at relative humidity above 75 %. The optimum temperature for growth is 30 -35 o C. In salted fish, brownish black or yellow brown spots are seen on the fleshy parts. This is mainly caused by growth of halophilic mould called Sporendonema epizoum. This gives the fish a very bad appearance.

During the initial stages of appearance of moulds on the fish, it is possible to remove them manually. In advanced stages when it has penetrated the flesh nothing can be done. To avoid the mould growth it is necessary that the fish be dried properly to pack the fish in required type of packaging material and keep it in a cool and dry place from moisture. Chemical method of prevention includes dipping the fish in a 5% solution of Calcium propionate in saturated brine for 3-5 minutes depending upon the size of the fish.

Rancidity

This is caused by the oxidation of fat, which is present in the fishes. Rancidity is more pronounced in oil rich fishes like mackerel, sardine etc. The unsaturated fat in the fish reacts with the oxygen in the atmosphere forming peroxides, which are further broken down into simple and odoriferous compounds like aldehydes, ketones and hydroxy acids, which impart the characteristic odors. At this stage the colour of the fish changes from yellowish to brown this is known as rust. This change results in an unpleasant flavour and odour to the product, thus leading to consumer rejection. Though a certain degree of rancidity can be accepted, it is seen that the nutritional value of these fishes are much lower than non-oxidized ones. These fatty fishes continue to become rancid during storage. Certain impurities in salt and traces of copper accelerate this.

Pink /Red Halophiles

This type of spoilage is mainly due to the presence of halophilic bacteria. The source of such bacteria the salt. It is commonly found in tropical countries like India. Spoilage appears on the surface as slimy pink patches. These bacteria are not harmful by nature. They are aerobic and proteolytic in nature, grows best at 36ºC by decomposing protein and giving out an ammoniacal odour.

Usage of good quality salt will avoid this. This spoilage is mostly found in heavily salted fish and absent in unsalted fish.

Insect Infestation

Spoilage due to insect infestation occurs


During initial drying stages
During storage of the dried samples.

The flies, which attack the fish during the initial drying stage are mainly blowflies belonging to the family Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae. These flies are attracted by the smell of decaying matter and odours emitted from the deteriorating fishes. During the glut season when the fish is in plenty and some are left to rot, these flies come and lay their eggs. These eggs develop into maggots, which bury within the gill region and sand for protection from extreme heat. They develop mainly when conditions are favourable with adequate moisture and intermittent rain. This results in both economic and nutritive loss to the fish processor.

Infestation can be reduced by:


Proper hygiene and sanitation
Disposal of wastes and decaying matter
Use of physical barriers like screens, covers for curing tanks etc
Use of heat to physically drive away the insects and kill them at 45ºC

The most commonly found pests during storage are beetles belonging to the family Dermestidae. Beetles attack when the moisture content is low and especially when the storage is for a long time. The commonly found beetles are Dermestes ater, D frischii, D maculates, D carnivorous and Necrobia rufipes. The larva does most of the damage by consuming dried flesh until the bones only remain.

Mites are also an important pest, which are found infesting dried and smoked products. They are very minute and bring about powdering of the product thereby giving it a white appearance. Lardoglyphus konoi is the commonly found mite in fish products.

Fragmentation

Denaturation and excess drying of fish results in breaking down of the fish during handling. Fish can become brittle and liable to physical damage when handled roughly. It is necessary that fresh fish be used as raw material to ensure a good finished product.
