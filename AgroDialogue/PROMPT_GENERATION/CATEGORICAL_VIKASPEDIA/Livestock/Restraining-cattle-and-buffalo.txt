Restraining cattle and buffalo


Restraining (Controlling) large ruminants

The crush or race, made of wood or metal is used for restraining animals. Crushes are used for large ruminants when they are vaccinated, examined or undergo other treatments.

How to hold animals

If you do not have a halter or a nose holder the best way to hold a large ruminant is to take a firm grip of the nostril using the thumb and forefinger of one hand while holding the horn or the ear with the other hand.

Haltering large ruminants


Animals need to be halter-trained and this is best done when they are young so that they are accustomed to the halter. 
When a halter is used on an animal talk to the animal to encourage it to move.
 Hold the halter no more than 20 cm from the animal cheek and walk close to its neck.

Casting or throwing cattle and buffalo

If you do not have a crush and you want to trim the hooves of an animal it will be necessary for you to cast (throw down) the animal. To do this you will need:


A halter for 	the head.
Two people 	to help you.
Ten to 	twelve metres of strong rope.
A place 	where it is safe to throw the animal, where the soil is soft or 	covered with straw.

First halter the animal then tie the long rope around it as shown in the illustration below. Have one person to hold the halter while the other joins you and pulls the rope. The animal will collapse onto the floor and your helper must immediately put his knee on its neck and his hand on the animal's head to prevent it from rising.

Do not leave the animal down for a long time as bloat may develop. Remember when casting animals that both the animal and people can get injured so try to do it safely.
