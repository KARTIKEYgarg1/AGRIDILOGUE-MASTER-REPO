It is a deep rooted perennial forage legume adapted to a wide range of conditions ranging from tropical to alpine.
It is very palatable and nutritious forage legume containing 15 - 20% crude protein on dry matter basis
Lucerne adds nitrogen to soil and improves soil fertility.

Para Grass


It is suitable for cultivation in humid areas.
It is grown in seasonally flooded valleys and lowlands and can withstand water logging and long term flooding.
It cannot grow on dry lands in arid or semi - arid areas.
It is sensitive to cold and makes little or no growth during winter months in sub-tropical regions of India.
Water logged soils are best suited for this crop.
It can be grown on sandy soils also, provided water supply is sufficient.
Seed setting is very poor in this grass. It is propagated exclusively by stem cuttings.
It can be planted at any time in South Indian conditions, but June - July planting is advisable under rainfed.
There are no improved varieties of this grass (only local).
Thin shoots are used as planting material. Stems with 2-3 nodes are planted in 45-60 cm rows at 20 cm spacing. The stems are pressed into wet soil leaving the two ends sticking up.
800-1000 kg of stem cuttings are needed for planting one hectare.
The first cut is taken 75-80 days after planting and the subsequent cuts at 40-45 days interval. Totally, 6-9 cuts can be taken in a year with an  green fodder yield of 80-100 t/ha.
This grass is fed in the green form.
It is not suitable for conservation either as hay or as silage.

Blue buffel grass

Neelakolukattaipull Var. Co-1:


Cenchrus is a promising green grass type which performs well in drylands cultivation under rainfed conditions.
Cenchrus cilliaris (Anjan grass) and C. setigerus (Black anjan grass) are the two commonly grown species but low yielding in nature.
Cenchrus glaucus is yet another type found to grow well in dry land areas but superior than the other species.
Well drained soil with high calcium content is suitable.
Seed required is 6-8 kg/ha.
Harvest first cut on 70th or 75th day after sowing and subsequent 4-6 cuts depending on growth.
A pure crop yields 40 t/ha/year in 4-6 cuts.

Tree fodders

Subabul


It has seasonal varieties.
Jun - Jul Hawaiian giant (lvory coast), Co1.
Rainfed (Sep - Oct) K 8, Giant lpil - lpil, Co 1.
Plants can be harvested in as short as 6 months after planting. However, the initial cutting should not be done until the trunk has attained at least 3 cm diameter or the plant has completed one seed production cycle.
Harvests can be repeated once in 40 - 80 days depending upon growth and season.
In drought prone areas, allow the trees to grow for two years to ensure deep root penetration before commencing harvest.
The trees can be cut at 90 to 100 cm height from ground level.
As green fodder under irrigated conditions, a pure crop yields about 80 to 100 t/ha of green fodder.
Under rainfed conditions 40 t/ha of green fodder is got after 2 years of initial growth and pruning to a height of 100 cm

Glyricidia


It is a small tree, semi-deciduous, with pale bark.
G. sepium tolerates a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions. Growth is most rapid in regions where annual rainfall exceeds 900 mm, but it will grow where rainfall is as low as 400 mm per annum.
It grows in soils ranging from heavy clays to sands and on rocky eroded sites; however, it is intolerant of water logging.
The plant is used for fuel wood, animal feed, green manure, shade, poles, and living fences and as support plants.
Used as an ornamental and as a shade tree for coffee.
Propagated through seed or cuttings.
Glyricidia sepium and Glyricidia maculata are the two species available.
G. maculata is more useful as green leaf manure. It also fixes atmospheric nitrogen and thereby improves soil fertility.
It is able to produce profuse branching and fresh growth after every cutting.
If cultivated along the border in one heactare, it will supply enough green leaf manure for 2 to 2.5 hectares of land.

Sesbania


The leaves of Sesbania trees are highly palatable and mostly liked by goats.
The protein content in this is about 25%.
Grown throughout the year under irrigation.
Comes up in soils with good drainage.
Seed rate is 7.5 kg /ha, sow the seeds at a spacing of 100 cm x 100 cm (100 cm between ridges and 100 cm between plants within the ridge).
First cut after 8 months subsequent harvests at an interval of 60-80 days.
Green fodder yield of 100 tonnes per year is obtained from one hectare.

Azolla- As Livestock Feed

About Azolla


Azolla is a floating fern which resembles algae
Normally azolla is grown in paddy fields or shallow water bodies
Multiplies very rapidly

 



Azolla as fodder/ feed


Rich in proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin B12 and Beta- Carotene), growth promoter intermediaries and minerals like calcium, phosphorous, potassium, ferrous, copper, magnesium
On dry weight basis, it contains 25 - 35 percent protein, 10 - 15 percent minerals and 7 - 10 percent of amino acids, bio-active substances and bio-polymers
Livestock easily digest it, owing to its high protein and low lignin content
Azolla can be mixed with concentrates or can be  given directly to livestock
Can also be fed to poultry, sheep, goats, pigs and rabbits.

Azolla Production


The soil in the area is first cleared of weeds and leveled
Bricks are lined horizontally in a rectangular fashion.
A UV stabilized silpauline sheet of 2m X 2m size  is uniformly spread over the bricks in such a way as to cover the margin of the rectangle made by the bricks
10-15 kg of sieved soil is uniformly spread over the silpauline pit
Slurry made of 2 kg cow dung and 30 g of super phosphate mixed in 10 liters of water, is poured onto the sheet. More water is poured on to raise the water level to about 10 cm
About 0.5-1kg of pure mother azolla culture seed material is spread uniformly over the water, after mild stirring of soil and water in the azolla bed. Fresh water should be sprinkled over the azolla immediately after inoculation to make the azolla plants upright
In a week’s time, the azolla spreads all over the bed and develops a thick mat like appearance.






A mixture of 20 g of super phosphate and about 1 kg of cow dung should be added once in 5 days in order to maintain rapid multiplication of the azolla and to maintain the daily yield of 500 g
A micronutrient mix containing magnesium, iron, copper, sulphur etc., can also be added at weekly intervals to enhance the mineral content of azolla
About 5 kg of bed soil should be replaced with fresh soil, once in 30 days, to avoid nitrogen build up and prevent micro-nutrient deficiency
25 to 30 percent of the water also needs to be replaced with fresh water, once every 10 days, to prevent nitrogen build up in the bed
The bed should be cleaned, the water and soil replaced and new azolla inoculated once every six months
A fresh bed has to be prepared and inoculated with pure culture of azolla, when contaminated by pest and diseases

Harvesting


Will grow rapidly and fill the pit within 10 - 15 days. From then on, 500 - 600 g of azolla can be harvested daily.
Can be done every day from the15th day onwards with the help of a plastic sieve or tray with holes at the bottom
The harvested azolla should be washed in fresh water to get rid of the cow dung smell

Alternative Inputs


Fresh biogas slurry may also be used
Waste water from bathroom and cattle shed can also be used to fill the pit. In areas where there is a problem of fresh water availability, the water left after washing clothes (after the second rinsing) can also be used.

Environmental factors for the growth


Temperature 20°C - 28°C
Light 50% full sunlight
Relative Humidity 65 - 80%
Water (standing in the tank) 5 - 12 cm
pH 4-7.5

Points to be noted during cultivation of azolla


Washing in a net will be useful as it will allow small plantlets to get out, and they can be poured back in to the pond
Care should be taken to retain the temperature below 25°C.
Shade nets can be used to cut the light intensity.
The azolla biomass should be removed daily to avoid over crowding.
