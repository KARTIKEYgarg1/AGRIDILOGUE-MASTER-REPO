Management practices for enhancing productivity of piggery farm


Introduction

Pig farming constitutes the livelihood of rural poor belonging to the lowest socio-economic strata and they have no means to undertake scientific pig farming with improved foundation stock, proper housing, feeding and other management. In India pig rearing is very popular amongst the tribal backward and weaker section of the society, especially North Eastern region (NER). Moreover, pig farming fits very well with the integrated farming and also be complementary to intensive crop production programme. NER also has the tremendous potentiality of improvement of pig production through scientific management, as in NER the deficit is aggravated due to traditional ways of pig rearing like feeding of locally available feed stuff and scavenging, improper breeding, sizeable population of non - descript pigs and non-availability of good quality pig germplasm always remains matter of concern.

Selection of pig Breeds

Different pig  breeds  are  presently  available  in  the  region  viz, non-descript, Hampshire and  their  cross breeds.  The selection is based on consumer preference, growth rate and meat quality. For example black skin pig is more preferable than other pigs. However, ICAR Research complex for NEH region have developed upgraded pig having 50 per cent,75 per cent and 87.5 per cent Hampshire blood and were found to be  very much suitable for the region due to faster growth rate, high meat quality and disease resistance capacity. Therefore, quality pigs should be procured  from  known  Research  and  developmental  agencies,  State  Veterinary  Department, NGOs  and  other  breeder  farmers.  Normally pigs that have acclimatized in the area need to be chosen.

Breeding management

Indigenous  pigs  normally  reared  by  farmers  are  bred  indiscriminately  without  much  choice  of  male.  Moreover,  during  the  process  of  scavenging,  there  is  no  control  over  breeding.  Reproduction   is  the   main   component   limiting   the   productive   efficiency   of   pig   industry.  Successful reproduction  is the outcome of  a series of  closely  linked  events. The  gilt must  grow  rapidly to attain sexual maturity, initiate estrous cycle, ovulate and be mated by a fertile boar or  inseminated  with  fertile  semen.  The  female  pig  becomes  sexually  mature  between  8 - 10  months  depending on the breed and nutrition level. But the local pig attains maturity at 5 - 6 months. The  length  of  the  estrous cycle  averages  approximately 21days  (18 - 24  days).  Signs of  heat  are  restlessness, loss of appetite, increased vocalization, frequent urination, red  swollen vulva, riding  other females, elevation of tail, arched back  etc. If the female is in heat she will remain stand still  when pressure i s applied on the loin region with the palms of both hands (standing reflex). It is  always  better  to  leave  one  or  two  estrous cycle  in  case  of  the  gilt  and  breeding  may  be  done  during  the  third  cycle  depending  on  the  physical  condition  of  the  gilt.  The  best time  for  AI  of  sow/gilt is 15 - 24 hours after the onset of estrus. She should be bred on the second day if she is  still  in  standing  heat. If  the  female  does  not  conceive,  it  will  repeat  its  heat  symptoms  after  21  days.  Those  who  do  not  repeat  are  presumed to  be  pregnant  which,  however,  needs  to  be  confirmed/ diagnosed with the help of a veterinarian.

Care during pregnancy and farrowing

After breeding,   the   sow   should   be   kept   in   dry   clean  and   hygienic   enclosure   in  comfortable  place.  It  should  be  closely  observed  for  estrus  symptoms  around  20  days  after  breeding  to  assure  the  non - return  of  estrus  and  expect  the  conception.  Pregnant  sow  should  be  shifted to a clean farrowing house before 3 weeks of farrowing. Clean and dry bedding material  preferably of dry paddy straw/hay has to be provided in the pen. The pregnant animal should be fed  individually .  In  most  of  the  cases  no  assistance  is  required  during  farrowing. New  born  piglets  are  active  and within  two  minutes  each  piglet reaches  a teat  and  attempt  to  suck  milk.  Sometimes respiration is delayed in newborn piglets. To stimulate the respiratory activity of the  piglet  the  mucous  should  be  removed  from  nose  and  mouth.  The  weaker  piglets  should  be  assisted  to  the  teat  so  that  they  can  suckle  the  first  milk  (colostrums). The  placenta  may  be  expelled during the phase of delivery as single mass after the birth of last piglet.  Care should be  taken to avoid crushing of newborn piglets during and after farrowing.

Feeding management

The growth and mortality of pigs largely  depend on their feeding regime. Pig is the most  efficient animal in converting feed to meat.  About 70 - 75 per cent of the total production cost of  the  pig  farm  is  due  to  the  feed  cost.  Generally  farmers  want  to  rear  pigs  with  zero  inputs  like  kitchen waste as well as vegetable waste mixed with rice polish/ wheat bran only. However, with  this feed it is not possible to get desired body weight and other production norms. It is therefore, very much important to feed the animals with economical but balanced feed which will contain  all  the  nutrient  requirements  for growth  and  to  support  the  life.  Generally  two  types  of  feeding are practiced. They are

The  poor  and  marginal  farmers  in  the  villages  who  can not  afford  to  provide  the  above  feed, can  feed  their  pigs  with  sweat  potato  (6 0%),  protein  source,  vitamins  and  minerals. Besides the  above  the  pigs  can  also  be  maintained  with  vegetables  waste  and  kitchen  waste  consisting  of  cooked  rice,  vegetables  etc.  and  also  with  brewery  waste  and  other  feed  waste.  A good feed ration should contain the required nutrient in right proportion as per the need  of body  weight  along with adequate drinking water.

Feeding of  pregnant animal

The  demands  resulting  from  pregnancy  and  need  for  conserving  nutrients  for  ensuing  lactation  are  accelerated  during  the  later  stage  of  pregnancy.  The increased  needs  are  for  proteins,  vitamins  and  minerals.  Mature  sows  gain  30 - 35  kg  and  gilts  40 - 45  kg  during  pregnancy. Feed should be so regulated that sows and gilts are never over fat or thin.  Feed lightly  with bulky laxative feed immediately before an d after farrowing. Bring the sow to full feeding in  10 days. Plenty of greens may be provided. Feed allowance may be calculated as 2.5 - 3 kg/100 kg  body weight plus at the rate of 0.2 kg feed per piglet with the sow. Thus, a sow weighing 100 kg  with  8  piglets  should  receive  4.6  kg  feed  per  day.  The  piglets  may  be  provided  with  special  nourishing diet called creep feed separately.

Creep feeding

The practice of self - feeding concentrates to young piglets in a separate enclosure away from their  mother is known a s creep feeding. Creep feed should be given when piglets are two weeks old.  Each active and healthy piglet may consume about 10 kg feed before reaching the age of 8 weeks  and two - third of this consumed between 6 - 8 weeks.

Orphan pigs

When a sow dies or fails to produce milk or does not claim her pigs, the piglings should be  promptly shifted to a foster mother. Some sows may refuse to suckle alien piglings. Care should  be taken to simulate the conditions including the odour and body size of piglings when admitted  to a foster mother or another suckling sow. Cow’s milk is the best substitute for sow’s milk for  hand  feeding  if a  lactating  mother  is  not  available.  Buttermilk  or  sweet  skim  milk  can  also  be  used.  Each  pigling  may  consume  300 - 500  ml  milk  per  day.  Best  results  may  be  secured  by  feeding  5 - 6  times  a  day  for  the  first  few  weeks  and  thereafter  the  frequency  may  gradually  be  reduced to 2 - 3 times. Any standard vitamin preparation two or three times the quantity used for  infants  may  be  administered  to the  piglings  until  they  start  taking  feed.  Injectable  iron  preparation  (e.g.  Imferon)  may  be  given  as  usual.  A  60 - Watt  electric  bulb  may  provide  enough  warmth for the piglings during the early days of life.

Flushing

It  is  the  method  of  increased  feeding to  sows  and  gilts  before  breeding  to  enhance  litter  size. A good grower ration fed to pigs for seven to ten days before breeding to increase ovulation  rate in them. After breeding animals should be fed a limited but well balanced ration until the last  six weeks   of   pregnancy   and   then   full   feeding   should   be   resumed   to   avoid   pregnancy  complications.

Housing

While selecting the site for pig farm, it must be near to town/city to avoid transportation  cost of feed or other requirements and to avail marketing facilities. Housing  is  required  for  the  animals  to  protect  them  from  rain,  wind,  storm,  and  sunlight,  cold  and  extreme  climate.  The  pigsty  may  be  constructed  with  locally  available  materials  like  wooden  plunks,  jungle  post,  bamboo  and  thatch  grasses  or  the  houses  may  be  of  brick  wall,  RCC  post  and  with  Corrugated  Galvanized Iron/asbestos sheet  roofing. Floor should be cemented for easy cleaning and hygienic  point of view.  Pig can be kept under two systems and indoor system. A combination of both may  be  followed.  It  is  easy  to  manage  animals  in  indoor  system  compared  to  open  air  system.  However in open air system more areas needed for animals, that is limitation particularly in NE  Region.  Further  in  open  air  system,  possibilities  of contamination  of  diseases  a re  more  than  indoor  system.  Each  animal  of  different  categories  requires  a  minimum  floor  space  for  housing.

Important points for pig housing

Construct shed on dry and properly raised ground. 
Avoid water - logging, marshy and heavy rainfall areas.
The side walls of the sheds should be 4 - 5  ft. high and remaining height should be fitted  with GI pipes or wooden poles.
The walls should be plastered to make them damp proof.
The roof should be at least 8 - 10 ft. high.
The pig sty should be well ventilated.
The  floor  should  be  pakka/hard ,  even,  non - slippery,  impervious,  well  sloped  (3  cm  per  metre) and properly drained to remain dry and clean.
A  feed  trough  space  of  6 - 12  inches  per  pig  should  be  provided.  The  corners  of  feed  troughs, drains and walls should be rounded for easy cleaning.
Provide adequate open space for each animal which should be double of covered area
Provide proper shade and cool drinking water during summer  season. 

Deep litter housing

Deep litter housing is a type of pig housing where  the floor is filled with sawdust 2 - 3 feet  in  the  both  open  and  covered  are a,  which  is  well  suited  for  high  rainfall  and  high  altitude  area.  The floor of the pen remains clean and dry due to the sawdust. The pig house also provides better  micro - environment in summer and winter as well as better physiological adaptation. This model  provide 2 - 3 times higher manure than that conventional concrete floor pigpen.

Diseases and health Care

Health care measure to be followed in a pig farm is one of the most important factors and  if not followed properly, farmer may incur a heavy loss.  The pigs can be infected with a number  of  internal  parasites,  skin  infections  and  other  bacterial  and  viral  diseases,  which  in  turn  will  result in poor growth and even death of pig. In general, illness in pig is characterized by dullness,  8 loss  of  appetite, declination  to  move  or  sluggish  movement,  rough  body  coat,  constipation  or  diarrhea,  dull  eyes,  dull  skin  and  hair,  separates  itself  from  the rest  etc.  The  piglet  should  be dewormed  once  in  three  months.  Worms  from  pigs  may  infect  human  being  also. Most  commonly  found  parasitic  disease  in  NEH  region  are  Ascaries,  Strongly  infection,  Coccidiosis  and  mange  mite  infection. Drugs  like  Piperzine@250 - 3 00mg/kg  b.wt  in  feed  and  water,  Fenbendazole  @5mg/kg  b.wt  in  feed  (Single  dose)  or  Ivermectin  @0.3mg/kg  b.wt  (s/c) are  useful against parasitic infection in pig. The pregnant sow should be treated before farrowing.

Another commonly occurring  ailment in pig is the skin infection which may be caused by  ticks , mites  and  lice.  Mange  caused  by  mites  may  occur  around  the  head,  ears,  legs  and  tails  which subsequently spread all over the body. Tick and lice  feed on the skin and  irritate the pigs  which will scratch its body. The skin infection caused by the external parasites can be treated by  spraying.   Dipping   or   painting  with   Butox - 1%   solution   spray   or   dipping   or   painting   or Deltamethrin  @50 - 75ppm (two  application  at  1 0  days  interval or  Ivermectin  @0.3mg/kg  b.wt  (s/c) should  be  done  regularly. Other  diseases  like  piglet  diarrhoea,  salmonellosis,  mastitis  etc  can  be  treated  when  it  occurs  in  consultation  with  the  veterinarian.

The  important  infectious  diseases of pigs


Classical  swine  fever or  Hog  cholera is  one  of  the  most  important  and  devastating  viral  diseases of pigs. The disease affects both domesticated and wild pigs under natural conditions. It  is characterized by fever, multiple generalized petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages giving rise  to  visceral  and  skin  lesion.  Symptoms  of  tremor,  in coordination and  paralysis  and  occasionally  peracute death without any signs may also be observed. Farmers  should be  advised to vaccinate  the  animals against swine fever  about  20 - 30 days before breeding. 
Respiratory disorder/ Pneumonia: it is frequently caused by Pasteurella, it is considered to be  an  important  disease  of  pigs.  Symptoms  like  affected  pigs  are  apathetic,  anorexia,  high  fever,  coughing  and  sneezing,  difficulty  in  breathing,  red  eyes  with  discharge.  The  treatment  is  more  effective if appropriate antibiotic is used based on the drug sensitivity of the isolated bacteria. 
Colibacillosis (piglet diarrhoea): It is caused by pathogenic strains of  Escherichia coli and i s a  disease  primarily  of  the  newborn  or  young  pigs.  The  disease  may  be  manifested  by  diarrhea,respiratory  distress  and  arthritis.  Thorough  sanitation,  adequate  feeding  of  colostrums  and  milk  during the first few hours after birth is important to reduce the problem. Oral rehydration therapy  along with specific antibiotics is useful for the treatment of the affected piglets. Occurrence of most of the diseases can be prevented by following strict hygienic measure  and by timely vaccination of pigs. A separate house should be there to keep the animals suffering  from contagious diseases.

Other managemental practices


Culling   of   animals: Unproductive   with   very   less   litter   size   or   with   very   high  interfarrowing  period,  repeat  breeders,  aged  animals,  unproductive  b oars  etc.  are  to  be  culled and sold out for meat purpose. 
Castration of piglets: Male piglets which are unwanted and not fit for breeding purpose  are  to  be  castrated  just  after  weaning  and  may  be  kept  in  the  farm  as  fattener  animal  which later on may be sold for meat purpose.
 Segregation  of  diseased  animal: A  separate  house  should  be  there  to  keep  the  animals  suffering from contagious diseases. 
Record Keeping: The ultimate profit or loss in a farm can only be found out by keeping  proper records in the  farm  which includes data sheet of individual animal, total stock of  animals, feed register, expenditure statement etc.
