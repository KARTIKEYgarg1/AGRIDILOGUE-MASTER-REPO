Moth bean Crop Stage Wise IPM






Management
 
Activity




Pre-sowing




 


Common cultural practices:

Timely sowing should be done. 
Field sanitation. 
Destroy the alternate host plants 
Plant tall border crops like pearl millet,   sorghum for the management of aphids and whitefly. 
Adopt ecological engineering by growing the   recommended attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the field bunds.





Nutrients



Get the soil sample tested and apply nutrients   based on soil test report. Soil is brought to fine tilth by 2-3 ploughing   with harrow or plough. 
Incorporate 4 to 5 tonnes of Farm Yard Manure   per acre in soil 2-3 weeks before sowing.





Weeds



Solarisation of soil during summer reduces   weed infestation.






Sowing





 


Common cultural practices:

Timely and line sowing should be done 
Use healthy, certified and weed free seeds. 
Sow with proper spacing





Nutrients



Fertilizers should be applied on soil test   basis





Weeds



Always use certified and weed free seeds. 
Timely sowing should be done. 
Line sowing should be done to facilitate   inter-culture operations. 
Plant population should be maintained to its   optimum right from its beginning to minimize the crop weed competition





Vegetative stage




 


Common cultural practices:

Collect and destroy diseased and insect   infested plant parts. 
Provide irrigation at critical stages of the   crop 
Avoid water stress and water stagnation   conditions. 

Common mechanical practices:

Collection and destruction of eggs, early   stage larvae and adult beetles of white grub. 
Use yellow sticky traps for aphids and   whitefly. 
Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6   pm and 10 pm 

Common biological practices:

Conserve natural enemies through ecological   engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies





Nutrients



Correct micronutrient deficiency if any in   standing crop. 
Seed treatment of Thiourea @ 500 ppm in light   soils. 
Foliar application of Thiourea @500ppm   solution twice in standing crops





Weeds



Keep field boundary &amp; bunds free from   weeds. 
The crop field should be weed free initially   for 3-4 weeks. 
Inter-culture operation/hoeing should be done   twice at 20 and 35 days after sowing-using hand hoe to remove all weeds in   between the row. 
Mulches like straw, hay, plastic, etc. should   be used in between the rows to suppress the weed growth





Aphids



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices.

Cultural control:

Apply optimum doses of nitrogen fertilizers 
Regular field monitoring in the morning hours   for monitoring of pests and defender population, barrier crops like pearl   millet and sorghum around the field. 

Biological control:

Conserve predators such as ladybird beetles   (Cocciniella septumpunctata, Menochilus sexmaculata and Brumoides suturalis.





Root grub



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices 

Biological control:

Use Entomopathogenic nematodes





Whitefly



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices 

Biological control:

Spray neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) 5%. 
Spray neem oil @ 1%





Spotted pod borer



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 

Cultural control:

Inter cropping are found to be effective. 
Collect and destroy the larvae. 
Keep the field weed free in the initial 25-40   days through intercultural operations and hand weeding





Pod bugs



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices 

Biological control:

Aggregation pheromone traps are widely used as   a monitoring tool and partial control measure





Fusarium wilt



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices





Mung bean Yellow mosaic virus



Follow common mechanical and biological   practices

Cultural practices:

All the infected plants should be removed   carefully and destroyed. 
Control the whitefly





Bacterial leaf spot/blight


Follow common mechanical and biological practices
Cultural control:

Use disease free and certified seeds.





Charcoal rot or ashy stem blight



Follow common mechanical and biological   practices 

Cultural control:

All the infected plants should be removed   carefully and destroyed. 
Follow intercropping cropping system   (Mothbean: Sesame) (1:1 ratio). 
Irrigate field every two weeks to avoid stress   contitions





Reproductive stage




Nutrients



Incorporate crop residues in soil immediately   after harvest





Weeds



Remove left over weeds to prevent weed seed   spread in field.





Pod bugs



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices 

Biological control:

Aggregation pheromone traps are widely used as   a monitoring tool and partial control measure.





Spotted pod borer



Same as in vegetative stage
