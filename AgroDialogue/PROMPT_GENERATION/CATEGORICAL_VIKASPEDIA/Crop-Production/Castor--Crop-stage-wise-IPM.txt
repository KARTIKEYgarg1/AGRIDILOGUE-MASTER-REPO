Castor: Crop stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Deep ploughing of fields during summer • After summer ploughing field is left for solarization. • Timely sowing should be done • Field sanitation, rogueing • Destroy the alternate host plants • Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations • Sow the ecological engineering plants • Rotate the crop with a non host crop • Sow / plant sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around castor crop as a   guard/barrier crop.


Nutrients
• Deep summer ploughing to break   hard pan and to facilitate rain water absorption &amp; deep root   penetration. • Nutrients should be applied based on the soil test report and   recommendations for the particular agro-climatic zone. • Use well decomposed FYM @ 4-5 t/acre or Vermicompost @ 2.0 t/acre or   castor cake @ 0.4 t/ acre treated with Trichoderma at the time of last   ploughing. • Apply Vermicompost and FYM at 1 week and 3-4 weeks before sowing,   respectively. • Do not leave FYM or compost exposed to sunlight as nutrients may be   lost. • Apply 12 Kg sulphur/acre through gypsum at the time of last ploughing for   higher castor yield.


Weeds
• Summer ploughing should be   done to expose and destroy weed seeds/ rhizomes by soil solarization. • At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique i.e. pre   sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in   field. • Black plastic mulch prevents entry of light, which restricts germination   of weed seeds and growth.


Soil   borne pathogens, nematodes, resting stages of insects
Cultural control: • Deep summer ploughing of fields to control resting stages of insect   pests. • Avoid excessive watering and provide proper drainage in the field. • Practice green manuring and intercropping with red gram for the control   of root rot. Biological control: • Apply neem cake @ 100 Kg/acre at the time of transplanting for reducing   capsule borer damage



Seed sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Use resistant/tolerant varieties. • Use healthy, certified and weed seed free seeds.


Nutrients
• Before sowing, soil testing   should be done to find out the soil fertility status. Nutrient should be   provided as per soil test recommendations. • Biofertilizers: Seed/seedling treatment should be done with   Azotobactor/Azospirillum and phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (PSB) @ 250 g   each /acre seed/seedlings and VAM inoculum @ 1Kg /acre. • Apply 1/ 3 of N and full dose of P &amp; K as basal at the time of   sowing


Weeds
• Line sowing should be done to   facilitate inter-culture operations. • Plant population should be maintained to its optimum right from beginning   to minimize the crop weed competition. • Intercropping with short duration pulse crops such as moong bean should   be done to suppress weeds between rows.



Vegetative stage




Common cultural practices: • Collect and destroy crop debris • Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • Avoid water logging • Avoid water stress during flowering stage • Judicious use of fertilizers • Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval   parasitoids are observed Common mechanical practices: • Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant   parts • Collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae • Handpick the older larvae during early stages • The infested shoots and seed capsules may be collected and   destroyed • Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on   stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. • Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such   as King crow, common mynah etc. • Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies


Nutrients
• Apply 1/3rd of N as top   dressing at first flower initiation state at 35 to 40 days after sowing and   remaining 1/3rd at 65 to 70 days after sowing depending on rainfall or along   with irrigation.


Weeds
• First hoeing should be done at   3 weeks after germination followed by second hoeing at initiation of first   spike. • The crop should be maintained weed free initially for 6-8 weeks by   following timely hoeing and weeding. • Mulches like straw hay, plastic, etc. can be used in between the rows to   suppress the weed growth.
