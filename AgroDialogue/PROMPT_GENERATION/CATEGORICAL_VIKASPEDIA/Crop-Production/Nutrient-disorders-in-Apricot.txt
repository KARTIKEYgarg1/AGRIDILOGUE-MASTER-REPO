Nutrient disorders in Apricot


Nitrogen

If nitrogen is deficient, older lower leaves of fruit trees may become yellow, terminal shoot growth is reduced, and fruit yields decline since the tree may not set or carry much fruit. Severe deficiency causes reddish leaves. If nitrogen is excessive, vegetative growth may be lush, but fruit set may be reduced and fruit maturity delayed by 7 to 10 days. Therefore, either an excess or deficiency of nitrogen should be avoided.

Zinc

Leaves are small, narrow, closely spaced and mottled with yellow, especially new leaves. Lateral leaf buds may fail to grow. Affected trees have small new leaves. In severe cases the entire tree may be yellow.

Iron

Younger leaves appear yellowish because of intervainal chlorosis.

Sunburn at planting

The bark of newly-planted apricot saplings is easily damaged by intense sun light. The injured bark is easily infested by borer insects. Protect the bark from sunburn by painting with white dilute paint. Apply the paint mixture from the soil surface up the entire trunk, including the dormant buds.

Boron

B deficiency symptoms include chlorosis, necrosis, and deformations on young leaves and at growing points. Twigs die back and fruit fails to set. To avoid boron deficiency, apply H2BO3 (0.1%) as  foliar spray.

Gumming of apricot trees

Severely symptoms appear on trees more than 10 years old. Affected trees are smaller and exhibit shoot dieback and less overall vegetative growth than healthy trees. The trunk, branches appeared rough with gummy spots in inner bark tissues. Leaves become yellow and may drop. The disorder is caused by high level of water table, acidity in the soil and irrigation water.

For control: Improve drain system in the orchard.
