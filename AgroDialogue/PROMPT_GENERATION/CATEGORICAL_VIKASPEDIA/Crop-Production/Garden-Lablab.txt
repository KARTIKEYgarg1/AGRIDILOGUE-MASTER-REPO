Sowing

Prepare the land to  fine tilth. Form beds and channels for bushy types. In  South and Central India, it is grown as a mixed crop with ragi and sorghum. Seeds are dibbled  at  a  spacing  of  1.0  m  in  between  ragi  or   sorghum.

Pole  types  are  usually  sown  in  backyards  of  homesteads.    Take  pits  of  45-60  cm   diameter  during  June-July  and  full  with  green  leaves  and  wet  cow  dung.    Allow  manure  to   decompose properly for 2-3 weeks.  Cover pits with top soil and sow 3-4 seeds in a pit.  Erect a  bower with bamboo poles  over an area of 4.0 x 4.0 m keeping pit at the centre.

A seed rate of 20-25 kg/ha is required for pure crop.

Treat  the seeds with Carbendezim  (or) Thiram @ 2g/kg of seed 24hrs before sowing (or)  with talc  formulation of Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed (or) Pseudomonas   fluorescens@ 10 g/kg seed. Biocontrol agents are compatible with   biofertilizers. First treat the seeds with biocontrol agents and then  with  Rhizobium. Fungicides and biocontrol agents are incompatible.

Fertilizer application

Apply FYM at 12.5 t/ha.

Apply fertilizers basally before sowing.


 Rainfed : 12.5 kg N + 25 kg P2O5 + 12.5 kg K2O +10 kg S*/ha
Irrigated : 25 kg N + 50 kg P2O5 + 25 kg K2O + 20 kg S*/ha

*Note : Applied in the form  of gypsum if  Single Super Phospate is not applied as a source of phosphorus Soil application of 25 kg ZnSo4/ha under irrigated  condition.

Weed Management


Pre emergence application of  Pendimethalin 2  litres/ha  on 3 days  after sowing using Backpack/ Knapsack/Rocker  sprayer fitted with flat fan  nozzle using 500 l of water for spraying  one ha. After this, one hand weeding  on 40-45 days after sowing gives  weed free environment throughout the crop  period. 
If herbicides are not applied give two  hand weedings on 25 and 45 days after sowing. 

Irrigation

Irrigate immediately  after  sowing, followed by life irrigation on the third day. Irrigate at   intervals of 7 to 10 days depending upon soil and climatic conditions.  Flowering  and pod formation stages are critical periods when irrigation  is a must. Avoid  water stagnation at all stages. Apply KCl at 0.5 per  cent as foliar spray  during vegetative stage if there is moisture  stress.

Pest and disease management

Aphids, pod borer and leaf eating caterpillar are the major pests affecting Dolichos bean.   Among the diseases,  Cercospora  leaf spot and  Rhizoctoni  wilt are most serious.
