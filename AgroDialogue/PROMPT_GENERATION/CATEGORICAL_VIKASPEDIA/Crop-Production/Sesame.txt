Sesame


Sesame ( Sesamum  indicum  L.)  is  the  oldest  indigenous  oilseed  crop,  with  longest  history  of  cultivation  in  India.  Sesame  or  gingelly  is  commonly  known  as  til  (Hindi,  Punjabi,  Assamese,  Bengali,  Marathi),   tal   (Gujarati),   nuvvulu,   manchi   nuvvulu   (Telugu),   ellu   (Tamil,   Malayalam,   Kannada),  tila/pitratarpana  (Sanskrit)  and  rasi  (Odia )  in  different  parts  of  India.

India ranks first in world with  19.47 Lakh ha area and 8.66 Lakh tonnes production. The average  yield  of  sesame (413  kg/ha) in  India  is  low  as  compared  with  other  countries  in  the world (535 kg / ha).  The  main  reasons  for  low  productivity  of  sesame  are  its  rainfed  cultivation  in  marginal  and  submarginal  lands under   poor   management   and   input   starved   conditions.   However,   improved   varieties   and   agro  production technologies capable of increasing the productivity levels of sesame are now developed for  different agro ecological situations in the country.  A well managed crop of sesame can yield 1200 - 1500  kg/ha  under  irrigated  and  800 - 1000  kg/ha  under  rainfed  conditions.

The  crop  is  grown  in  almost  all  parts of the country. More than 85% production of sesame comes from , , Rajasthan, , Gujarat,   and Telangana.

Season and climate

Sesame  is  grown  in  almost  all  the  states  in  large  or  small  areas.  It  can  be  cultivated  up  to  the  latitude  of  1600m  (India  1200  m).  Sesame  plant  needs  fairly  high  temperature  during its life cycle. Normally the optimum temperature required during its life cycle is between 25 - 35 degree C. If the temperature is more than 40 degree C with hot winds the oil content reduces. If the temperature goes  beyond  45 degree C  or  less  than  15 degree C  there  is  a  severe  reduction  in  yield.

Season : Kharif in arid and                                     semi-arid tropics                                    and rabi/summer                                    in cooler areas

Climate :      Semi arid climate of                                     Western India, Central,  				        Eastern and Southern part of                                    India including lower                                    Himalayas

Soil

Sesame can be grown on a wide range of soils but well drained light to medium textured soils are preferred. The optimum pH range is 5.5 to 8.0, acidic or alkaline soils are not suitable.

Seed rate

A seed rate of 5 kg/ha is adequate to achieve the required plant population.

Sowing

For prevention of seed borne diseases, use seed treated with Bavistin 2.0 g/kg seed. Wherever bacterial leaf spot disease is a problem, soak the seed for 30 minutes in 0.025% solution of Agrimycin-100 prior to seeding.

Preparation of land Prepare the soil into a fine tilth by ploughing 2-4 times and breaking the clods. Broadcast seeds evenly. To facilitate easy seeding and even distribution seed is mixed with  either sand or dry soil or well sieved farm yard manure in 1:20 ratio. Work with harrow, followed by  pressing with wooden plank so as  to cover the seed in the soil.

Manuring

Apply cattle manure/compost as basal dressing and incorporate into the soil along with last  ploughing. Apply fertilizers as basal dose when there is enough moisture in the soil. Urea is  preferable to ammonium sulphate. Nitrogen may be applied in split doses, 75 per cent as  basal and the balance as foliar spray at 3 per cent concentration, 20-35 days after  sowing  keeping the discharge rate at 500 1 ha-1.

Interculture

The crop is very sensitive to weed competition during the first 20-25 days. Two weeding, one after 15-20 days of sowing and other at 30-35 days after sowing are required to keep the field weed free and to make moisture and nutrients available to the crop.

When the plants are  about 15 cm in height, thin the crop so as to give a spacing of   15-25 cm between plants.

Irrigation


Usually the crop is grown under rainfed conditions. When facilities are available, the crop   may be irrigated to field capacity after thinning operation and thereafter at 15-20 days interval.
Stop irrigation just before the pods begin to mature. Surface irrigation at 3 cm depth during the critical stages, viz., 4-5 leaves, branching,   flowering and pod formation will increase the yield by 35-52 per cent. 
Two irrigations of 3 cm  depth each in the vegetative phase (4-5 leaf stage or branching) and in reproductive phase   (at flowering or pod formation) are the best, registering maximum yield and water use   efficiency. 
In the case of single irrigation, it can be best given in the reproductive phase. 
In   the tail end fields in command area, best use of the sparingly available water can be made   for augmenting sesame production. 

Plant protection


For control of leaf and pod caterpillar, remove affected leaves and shoots and dust with   carbaryl 10 per cent. 
Azadirachtin 0.03 per cent at 5 ml per litre spray at 7th and 20th DAS  and thereafter need based application can manage the incidence of leaf and pod caterpillar,  pod borer infestation and phyllody incidence. 
For control of gall fly, give preventive spray   with 0.2 per cent carbaryl. 
 For control of leaf curl  disease, remove and destroy disease affected sesame plants  as well   as the diseased collateral hosts like chilli, tomato and   zinnia. 
 Remove plants affected with phyllody and  destroy them. Do not use seeds from affected    plants for  sowing.

Harvesting


Harvest the crop, when the leaves turn yellow and start drooping and the bottom capsules are lemon yellow by pulling out the plants. Harvest during  the morning hours. 
Cut the root portion and stack the plants in bundles for 3-4 days when  the leaves will fall off. Spread in the sun and beat with sticks to break open the capsules.
Repeat this for 3 days. Preserve seeds collected during the first day for seed purposes.  Clean and dry in sun for about 7 days before storing. 

Storage of seeds 


By keeping sesame seeds in polybags, tin bins, wooden receptacles or in earthen pots, the   viability can be maintained for about one year. 
Admixture of seeds with ash will drastically  reduce  germination.
