Horse gram


Horse  gram  is  an  important  crop  of South  India.  Its  grain  is  used for human consumption as ‘dal ’ as well as in preparation  of so called ‘rasam’ and also as a concentrated feed for cattle.  It  may  also  be  used  as  green  manure.  This  crop  is  generally  grown when the cultivator is unable to sow any other crop for want of timely rains and also  grown in vacant space of citrus orchard.

Horse gram is mainly cultivated in the states of Karnataka, , Odisha, Tamil  Nadu,  M.P. ,  Chhattisgarh,  Bihar,  W.B.,  Jharkhand, and  in  foot  hills  of  Uttaranchal  and  H.P.,  in  India.

Climate requirement

Horsegram  is  extremely  drought-resistant  crop.  Moderately  warm,  dry  climatic  conditions  are  suitable  for  its  optimum  growth.  It  does  not  grow  well  on  higher  altitudes  because  of  cool  and  wet  climate.  Horsegram  can  be  cultivated  up  to  an  altitude  of  1000 m  above  the  sea level. The temperature range of 25 - 30°C and relative humidity between  50 and 80% is  optimum for its growth. Heavy rains during the initial stages of crop  growth affect nodule  formation owing to poor aeration  in the soil. A well - distributed rainfall of about 800 mm is  sufficient for its successful cultivation, but it performs well even under low rainfall areas.

Soil Type & Field Preparation

Generally grown on  lateritic soil (poor in fertility) in  south India. The crop can be grown on  wide range of soils  from light to heavy soils  which are free from alkalinity.  The crop needs  minimum field preparations. Only 1 - 2 ploughings followed by planking provides desirable  seed - bed.

Sowing Time

The main season for sowing horse  gram is late August - November. As a  fodder   crop it is  sown  during  June - August.


In  Tamil  Nadu,  it  is  sown  in  September - November. 
In  Maharashtra, horse gram is sown as a kharif crop, mixed with bajra or sometimes Niger and  also  in  the  Rabi  in  rice  fallows. 
In  M.P.  it  is  a  Rabi  crop. 
In  northern  parts  it  is  grown  as kharif crop. 
In  the sowing period is October - November. 

Seed Rate & Spacing

Generally sown as broadcast with 40 kg/ha  seed rate for dual purpose i.e. grain and fodder.

For  line  sowing  25 - 30  kg/ha  is  enough  for  grain  crop.    Row  Spacing :  40 - 45  cm  during  kharif and 25 - 30 cm during rabi and about 5 cm plant to plant spacing.

Seed treatment

Seeds must be treated with seed treating fungicide to reduce infection by fungal  pathogens  found in the soil. Horse gram seeds are treated with carbendazim  (bavistin ) 2g for every k g of  seeds. Biofungicide  like Trichoderma  viridi is  recommended  for pulses  at  the  rate  of  4g  per kg  seed. After  fungicide  treatment  seed  should  be  inoculated  with  Rhizobium and PSB culture @ 5 - 7 g/kg of seed.

Fertilizer management

20  kg  nitrogen  and  30  kg  P2 O5 per  ha  as  basal  application  at  the  time  of  sowing  2 - 5  cm  below  and  in  the  side  of  the  seed  with  the  help  of  ferti-seed  drill  is enough  for  good  management of crop.

Water Management

Irrigation should be apply at before flowering and pod formation stage.

Weed Management

Due  to  luxuriant  growth  an  early  weeding/hoeing  is  enough  for  weed. Application  of  Pendimethalin  @  0.75 - 1  kg  a.i./ha  as  pre  emergence  application.  After  that,  one  hand  weeding at 20 - 25 days after sowing






Insect Pest/Disease/ Causal Organism Nature of Damage/ SymptomsControl Measures


Aphids
The adults and nymphs suck the juice  from the leaves as a result turn brown  and crumpled and the plants look sick.

 
Spray of Oxydemeton methyl 25 @ 1 ml/liter or  Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.7  ml/liter water



Jassids
The adults and nymphs suck the juice  from the leaves as a result leaves turn  brown an leaf surface become uneven.  In severe infection leaves dry up and  fall and weaken the plants


Pod borer
It is a polyphagous insect. Caterpillar  makes hole in pods, sometime also  feed seed.
Spray of  NPV @ 250 LE/ha. or Quinolphos  25  EC  @  2  ml/liter  water


Yellow  MosaicVirus vector - white fly
The symptoms firstly appear on young  leaves in the form of yellow, diffused,  round   spots   scattered   on   the   leaf  lamina.    The    infected    leaves    turn  necrotic.  The  diseased  plants  usually  mature  later  and  bear  relatively  few  flowers   and   pods.    The   pods   are  stunted  and  mostly  remained  immature but whenever seeds are form  they are small in size.
i.  Grown resistant varieties. ii. Destroy the infected  plants. iii. Spray of Oxydemeton  methyl 25 @ 2 ml/ liter or  Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.7  ml/liter water  and repeat  after 15 days, if necessary .


Root rot
Roots  rot  and  plants  show  yellowing  of  the  lower - most  leaves  followed  by  wilting.
Seed treatment with  2 g  C aptan or Carbindazim /  2  kg of seed. Avoid early sowing in  infested areas



Harvesting & threshing

As usual with other kharif pulses of Vigna group, clean seed should be sun dried for 3 - 4  days to bring their moisture content at 9 - 10% to be safely stored in appropriate bins.

Storage

To  avoid  further  development  of  bruchids  and  other  storage  pests  it  is  recommended  to  fumigate  the  storage  material  before  onset  of  monsoon  and  again  after  the  monsoon  with  ALP @ 1 - 2 tablets per tonne. The small quantity of the produce can also be protected by  mixing  inert  material  (soft  stone,  lime,  ash,  etc)  or  by  smearing  edible/non - edible  vegetable oils or by mixing plant products like neem leaf powder at the rate of 1 - 2% w/w  basis.

Yield

By  adopting  improved  package  of  practices  one  can  harvest  6 - 10 qtls  of  grain/ha  depending upon the monsoon  behaviour.

Recommendation to  achieve higher production


Deep summer ploughing once in 3 years. 
Seed treatment should be done before sowing. 
Application of fertilizer should be based on soil test value. 
Weed control should be done at right time. 
Adopt integrated approach for plant  protection.
