Large cardamom: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*




Common cultural practices: •  Deep ploughing of fields during   summer to control nematodes population and weeds. •  Soil solarization •  Timely sowing should be   done. •  Field sanitation, rogueing. •  Destroy the alternate host   plants •  Apply manures and fertilizers as   per soil test recommendations. •  Plant tall border crops like   maize, sorghum or millet to reduce pests population. •  Crop rotation with graminaceous   crops •  Adopt ecological engineering by   growing the attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the field   bunds. Common biological control: •  Apply neem cake @ 100 Kg/acre at   the time of transplanting for reducing capsule borer damage



Nursery stage



Nematode
•  Change the nursery site every year to avoid   nematode infestation. •  Soil solarization may be   practiced •  Apply well rotten farm yard manure


Seed selection
•  Use only seeds from certified   nurseries/plantations with a productivity of 400 kg/acre for three   consecutive years •  Select the seeds or clumps from   disease free healthy plants. •  Select variety which suits to   particular altitude area and locality


Chirkey &amp; foorkey viral   diseases
Cultural control: •  Regular survey of the plantation   to trace out diseased plants. •  Remove diseased plants completely   along with rhizome &amp;roots and destroy as soon as they are traced. •  Use healthy disease free planting   material preferably seedlings. •  Do not raise nurseries in the   vicinity of infected plantations. •  Destroy all the collateral host   plants of the aphids in and near the plantation.


Leaf thrips**
Cultural control: •  Its incidence is more in cardamom   seedling at lower altitude during April to November. •  Collect and destroy the infested   leaves. Biological control: Predators: Anthocoris and Orius spp., predatory thrips   (Aeolothripsintermedius, Mymarothripsgaruda),Chrysoperlacarnea, Malladasp,   praying mantids, lady bird beetles, syrphid flies, spiders etc.


Weeds
•  Line sowing of seeds in 15-25 cm raised   primary nursery at 10 cm distance and use mulch with local plant materials   upto germination of the seeds that is 25-30 days. After that remove the   mulch. •  Remulch the primary nursery   interole space with chopped paddy straw and leaves. •  Remove weeds manually from time to   time. •  When seeding attain 3-4 leaf   stage, they are transplanted to secondary nursery beds of 15 cm height and   100 cm width in May- June at 15 cm row spacing. •  The inter row space in secondary   nursery is also mulched with chopped paddy straw or dried leaf for 12 to 13   months. •  Alternatively, sucker   multiplication nursery may be established under the shade of forest trees/   pandals in tranches of 30x30 cm during May - June by planting the suckers   from healthy plantation. Remove weeds in this nursery from time to time. The   grown up tillers from buds are ready for planting in the main fields in June-   July.


Watering
•  Over watering may be avoided


Nutrients
•  Nutrients should be applied on the basis of   soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic   zone. •  For rhizome multiplication in   nursery, use organic matter rich top soil or add organic manures.



Plantation stage



Shade
•  Large cardamom is a shade loving crop,   maintain optimum shade


Nutrients
•  Apply well decomposed farm yard   manure. •  Apply chemical fertilizers based   on soil test @ 40:60 :40 kg N2P205 and K2O per kg in two splits - once in   April-May on receipt of 1 summer-shower and '2nd split in September- October   before monsoon is over •  Dig pits of 30 cm x 30 cm x 30cm   size and fill with organic manure and top soil. Contour planting may be done   in sloppy areas. •  Application of well decomposed FYM   or compost and 100 g of rock phosphate with the topsoil in the pit will help   in proper establishment and quick growth of plants. •  If the selected site is a hill   slope, terraces may be formed before digging pits.


Weed
•  Maintain weed free plantation. •  Destroy all the weeds from   planting area by ploughing during summer and remove all the perennial weeds   and their rhizomes/suckers before onset of monsoon.


Mulching and Earthing up
•  Thick mulching with dry leaves/grass may be   done on the base of the rhizome to keep the soil moist •  In old plantations, earthing up is   necessary to cover exposed roots and rhizomes of the plants


Leaf eating caterpillar
Cultural control: •  Collect and destroy infested   leaves along with larvae in June-July and October-December months. •  Community approach of mechanical   control may be adopted in the locality when the outbreak is observed. It may   totally suppress this pest in the course of 2-3 years. Biological control: •  Follow common cultural practices.


Aphids**
Cultural control: •  The removal and destruction of   diseased plants arehelpful in control of further spread of disease and in   reduction of aphid population. •  Destroy wild Amomum, Colocasia;   Curcuma and other , collateral host plants of the aphid vector in and near   the plantations


Shoot fly
Cultural control: •  Its damage is more in first 2-3   years after planting. Therefore, regularly monitor the new plantations. •  Remove infested young shoots at   ground level and destroy


Stem borer**
Cultural control: •  Remove and destroy the infested   shoots based on 'dead heart' symptoms


White grub**
Cultural control: •  Mechanical collection of adult   beetles during the emergence period is an effective method in managing the   pest. Biological control: •  Entomogenous fungus, Metarhizium   is also effective


Chirkey &amp; foorkey   disease
Cultural control: •  Regular survey of the plantation   to trace out diseased plants. •  Remove completely diseased plants   along with rhizome &amp;roots and destroy as soon as they are traced. •  Use healthy disease free planting   material preferably seedlings. •  Do not raise nurseries in the   vicinity of infected plantations. •  Destroy all the collateral host   plants of the aphids in and near the plantation.


Wilt disease
Cultural control: •  Planting in swampy or dry areas   may be avoided. •  Collect and destroy(by burning or   burying ) the affected plants .


Flower rot**
Cultural control: •  Avoid the accumulation of leaf   mass or waste plant parts over the inflorescence/spike during rainy   season. •  Spills of soil over 1hc spike may   be avoided at the time ofbase making by pouring soil to the plant base. •  Collect and bury affected   flowers/spikes



Vegetative



Weeds
•  Around the base of pits, weeds should be   removed with the help of sickles. •  Hand tool weeding should be   carried out 3 times in during March, July and August in a year for effective   control of weeds or •  Slash weeding may be done by using   power mover/weeder. •  After establishment of plantation,   inter crops with regional recommended crop like turmeric may be grown to   utilize the inter space of 1.5 to 1.8 meter between 2 rows during intial   years.



Flowering




•  Encourage the population of bumble bees   which are the main pollinators and also help to increase the yield. •  Remove mulch from   inflorescences/spikes during rainy season •  Spraying should be taken during   afternoon when the pollinators activities arc minimum


Weeds
•  Hand tool weeding should be carried out or   slash weeding may be done by using power mover/weeder.


Harvesting



•  Harvest at the right maturity of the   capsules at different altitudes to avoid the damage by rats and wild cats   etc.


Weeds
•  Left over weeds may be remove before   shedding of seeds to check their spread in subsequent years.


Note: The pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on   high volume sprayer. ** Pests of miner significance
