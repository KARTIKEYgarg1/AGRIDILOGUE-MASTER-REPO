Management
 
Activity




Pre- planting




 


Common cultural practices: 

Deep ploughing of fields during summer. 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Use resistant/tolerant varieties. 
Grow the attractant, repellent plants around   the field bunds. Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations





Nutrients



Nutrient should be applied on the basis of   soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
Prepare land by ploughing and harrowing. 
The pits are dug in summer about a fortnight   before planting and left undisturbed for solarization.
Pits of about 1m x 1m x 1m size are dug at a   distance of 4 to 5 meter in square system of planting. 
Under high density planting pits may be dug at   a spacing of 4m x 1m.





Weeds



Ploughing, harrowing, leveling and removing   the weeds before planting.





Termite


Cultural control:

Digging of termatoria and destroy the queen. 

Mechanical control: 

Locate and destroy the termite colony. 
Collect and destroy the termite affected setts   from the field.





Planting




 


Common cultural practices: 

Use healthy and certified plants 
Grow resistant/tolerant varieties 
Plant early maturing cultivars i.e, Prabhat,   Partap, Florda Prince, Early Grande, Flordasun and Shan-e-Punjab for fruit   fly. 
Irrigation should be done by ring method to   reduce possibility of collar rot 
Avoid plating in low-lying areas and flooding. 
Do not delay irrigation until the crop   exhibits moisture stress symptoms. 

Common mechanical practices: 

Remove and destroy the diseased orchard.





Nutrients



Planting is done in pits already filled with   top soil and organic manure during the months of December- January.
Mycorrhiza culture should be applied at the   time of planting or a basket of soil taken from old peach orchard is added to   each pit to ensure mycorrhizal association with peach roots. 
At the time of planting, manures and   fertilizers are applied @ 50 Kg FYM or compost, 20 g N + 15 g P + 15 g K per   plant.





Weeds



Use weed free seedlings for planting. 
Remove existing weeds in and around the pits   at the time of planting. 
During the initial 2-4 years, grow the   intercrop like pea, bean, soybean, and cowpea.





Soil borne diseases and nematodes



Resistant varieties 
Use healthy infestation-free plants. 
Application of neem cake @ 80 Kg/acre for   nematode control.





Application of Trichoderma harzianum / viride and Pseudomonas   fluorescens for treatment of seed/seedling/planting materials in the   nurseries and field application (if commercial products are used, check for   label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in   their fields, registration is not required).




Vegetative stage




 


Common cultural practices: 

Deep summer ploughing between the rows.

Common biological practices: 

Conserve natural enemies through ecological   engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies





Nutrients



Apply fertilizers according to the age of   plant @ 20 g N + 15 g P + 15 g K per plant in first year and doubling the   dose each year till a stabilised dose is reached at 6th years. 
Apply manures @ 50kg per plant in Dec.-   January every year along with full dose of P and K. 
The fertilizers should be applied in 20-30 cm   deep and 30cms wide trench along the drip line of the tree. 





Weeds



Deep ploughing during the first year to check   weed growth. Tool weeding on regular basis especially around the plants. 
Frequent tilling/ploughing up to 10 cm depth   during winter. 
To suppress the weeds between rows, leguminous   crops and vegetables can be grown as intercrops in the initial years. Use   slashing and moving between the rows to control the weeds.

Before pruning it is good orchard practice to   clean up any dead wood which may be lying around the orchard environment.





White root rot



Remove and destroy white root infested plants.   All roots, litter and debris from infected plants must also be removed and   destroyed. 
Creating a trench with a shovel around   infected areas prevent water runoff from distributing the fungal pathogen to   nearby plants. 
Preparing the soil before planting with soil   solarisation.

Fruiting stage




Nutrient Management



For mature trees, a mixture of 40 kg farmyard   manure, 500g N, 250 g P2O5 and 200 g K is recommended. The farmyard manure   should be applied during December-January along with full dose of P and K.   Nitrogen is applied in 2 parts, first half at 2-3 weeks before flowering and   the remaining half a month later. 
The band application of nitrogenous   fertilizers should be preferred over broadcasting. 
Under rainfed conditions, apply N through 1 or   2 foliar sprays of urea (0.5%) after fruit set.
Apply recommended micronutrients, if symptoms   are observed. Fruits are deformed under boron deficiency. 
To avoid boron deficiency, apply H2BO3 (0.1%)   as foliar spray.





Weed Management



Remove weeds around the plants. 
Use straw or black polyethylene Mulch to avoid   weed growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period. 
Mulching tree basins with 10-15 cm thick dry   grass also checks weed growth.





Flat headed borer, Hairy caterpillar, San jose scale, Root borer   and Tent caterpillar


Same as mentioned in the above flowering stage




Peach fruit fly


Cultural control: 

Harvest the ripening fruits and do not allow   the ripe fruits on the tree. 
Regular removal of fallen fruits from the   ground and bury the infested fruits atleast at 60cm depth. 
Shallow ploughing with cultivator immediately after   harvest is effective in exposing and killing the pupating larvae/pupae, which   are mostly present at 4-6 cm depth. 
If infestation is high, use bait splash on the   trunk only once or twice at weekly interval. To prepare bait splash, mix 100   gm of jaggery in one litre of water

Planting of attractant plants such as   sunflower





Frosty mildew, Leaf spot, Powdery mildew and Silver canker


Same as mentioned in the above vegetative stage




Whisker rot


Mechanical control: 

Preventing skin cuts and punctures during   harvest and packing is of prime importance in controlling rhizopus rot. 
Clean containers and good housekeeping in the   packing shed and storage reduce the rot. 
Store fruit at or below 39°F, the fungus does   not grow at temperatures below 40°F.
