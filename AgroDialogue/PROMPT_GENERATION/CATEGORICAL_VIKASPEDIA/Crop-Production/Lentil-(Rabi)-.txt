Lentil (Rabi) 


Lentil is  a  valuable  human  food,  mostly  consumed  as  dry  seeds  (whole  decorticated,  seed  decorticated  and  split).  In  India, its mostly consumed as ‘Dal’ by removal of outer skin and separation of  cotyledons. It  is  easy  to  cook  and  easily  digestible  with  high  biological  value. Dry  leaves,  stems,  empty  and  broken  pods  are  used as valuable cattle feed.

Lentil is also called as Masur and Malka (bold seeded).

The Lentil growing states in India are , , Bihar, Chattisgarh, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, etc

Climate

Lentil  requires cold climate. It is very hardy and can tolerate frost and severe winter to a great  extent.  It  require  cold  temperature  during  its  vegetative  growth  and  warm  temperature  at  the  time of maturity. The optimum temperature  for growth is 18-300 C. Its  range  of  cultivation  extends  to  an  altitude  of  3,500  m  in  north-west  hills.

Soil Type and Field Preparation

Well  drained,  loam  soils  with  neutral  reaction  are  best  for  lentil  cultivation.  Acidic  soils  are  not  fit  for  growing  lentil.  The  soil  should  be  friable  and  weed  free  so  that  seeding  could  be  done  at  uniform  depth.

On  heavy  soils,  one  deep  ploughing  followed  by  two  to  three  cross  harrowing  should  be  done.  After  harrowing,  the  field  should  be  levelled  by  giving a gentle slope to ease irrigation.

Lentil is grown on a wide range of soils ranging from light loamy sand to heavy clay soil in  northern parts, and in moderately deep, light black soil in  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Sowing time


Recommended  sowing  time  for  Rainfed :  First  fortnight  of  October  in  Central  and  South  India  and  second  fortnight  of  October  in  North  India; 
Under  irrigated  conditions - First  fortnight of November in North India 
Late sowing :  First week of December in rice  fallows of NEPZ or on fields vacated very late by kharif crops under irrigated condition.

Seed Rate and Sowing


 For  small  seeded : 40 - 45  kg/ha; 
For Bold  seeded : 45 - 60  k g/ha; 
For Late  sown  condition :  50 - 60  kg/ha; 
For Utera cropping : 60 - 80 kg/ha seed is recommended. 

Sowing should be done in rows  30 cm. apart and it should be sown at a lower depth (3 - 4 cm). This could be done  either by  using a Ferti-seed-drill or by seeding behind desi plough.

Seed treatment 


Fungicide: Thirum  (2  gm) + Carbendazim  (1gm )  or  Thirum  @ 3  gm  or  Carbendazim  @ 2.5 g per Kg. of seed; 
Insecticide: Chlorpyriphos 20 E.C. @8 ml./Kg. of seed; 
Culture: Rhizobium + PSB, one packet each for 10 kg seed 

Cropping systems

 Sequential cropping : 

The most common rotations under sequential cropping are:


Kharif fallow - Lentil (Rainfed areas)
Paddy - Lentil 
Maize - Lentil
Cotton - Lentil 
Bajra - Lentil 
Jowar - Lentil
Groundnut - Lentil 

Intercropping : 

Most common inter cropping  systems are:


Lentil  +  Sugarcane  (Autumn)  with  two  rows  of  lentil  at  30 cm  row  spacing  in  between  two  rows of sugarcane
Lentil + Linseed (2:2)
Lentil + Mustard (2:6 ) 

Irrigation

First irrigation should be given at 40 - 45 days of planting and  second at pod filling stage.  Most  critical  stage  for  moisture  stress  is  pod  formation  followed  by  flower  initiation.  In  absence  of  winter  rains  and  where  contribution  of  soil  moisture  is  negligible  viz . in  Central  India,  two  light  irrigations  may  be  applied  for  significant  yield  improvement.  More irrigation may affect the crop performance adversely.

Plant nutrient management

Generally Nitrogen 20 kg. Phosphorus 40 kg. and  Sulphur 20 kg. per hectare in medium  to low fertile soils as basal dressing. In  lentil grown in calcareous alluvial soils, apply 1.6 kg of Boron per ha as basal to each crop. In soils, low in Zn, soil application of 20 kg Zinc Sulphate is recommended under rainfed and  late sown condition; foliar spray of 2% urea improves yield.

Weed control

Two manual weeding, one at 25-30 days and another 45-50 days after sowing should be  done. Weedicide like  Pendimethalin 30 EC @ 0.75 - 1 kg a.i.  per hectare may be used as  a pre-emergence treatment. A weed-free period of early 45 - 60 days is important.

Pest and disease management

The major diseases of lentil are  rust in northern plain and  wilt  in Central zone. Use of resistant varieties is helpful in controlling the disease - small  seeded  Rust  resistant :  PL-406,  PL-639,  PL-4,  and L-4147 ;  bold seeded Rust resistant : L- 4076, DPL-15, IPL-406, DPL-62 etc.

Pest is not a major  problem in lentil. In some years  aphid population rises due to rise in temperature during January  of February, and causes  heavy damage. Spray of  Monocrotophos (0.04%)  is effective for  aphid  control.

Harvesting, threshing, storage

Crop become ready for harvest when leaves begin to fall, stem and pod turn brown  or  straw  in  colour  and  seeds  are  hard  and  rattle  with  15%  moisture  inside  them.  Over  ripening  may  lead  to  fall  of  pods  as  well  as  shattering  and  seed  cracking  if  seed  moisture fall below 10% due to delay in harvesting.

The crop should be allowed to dry for 4-7 days on threshing floor and threshed by  manually or bullock/power drawn thresher. The clean seed should be sun dried for 3-4  days  to  bring  their  moisture  content  at  9-10%.  The  seed  should  be  safely  stored  in  appropriate bins and fumigated to protect them from bruchids.

Yield - A well mange crop yields about 15 - 20 quintals of grain per hectare.

Recommendation to achieve higher production


Deep summer ploughing once in 3 years. 
Seed treatment should be done before sowing. 
Application of fertilizer should be  based on soil test value.
Wilt resistant/ tolerant  – RV L - 31, IPL81 (Noori), IPL  - 316,  Sekhar masoor - 2, Sekhar masoor - 2. 5. Rust  resistant/  tolerant  – IPL - 406,  WBL - 77,  Pant  L - 6,  Pant  L - 7,  Sekhar  masoor - 2,    Sekhar  masoor - 2, IPL - 316.
Adopt integrated approach  for plant protection.
Weed control should be done at right time
