Tapioca Crop Stage-Wise IPM






Management
 
Activity




Pre planting




 


Common cultural practices: 

Summer deep ploughing to a depth of 30-50 cm 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Avoid water logged conditions in the field 
Follow crop rotation 
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test   recommendations





Nutrient



Plough the field 4 – 5 times to get a fine   tilth. The soil depth should be at least 30 cm and form ridges, furrows and   mounds 
Nutrients should be applied on the basis of   soil test report and recommendation for the particular area 
Apply 5 to 12.5t/ha FYM and incorporate at the   time of ploughing along with P fertilizers if needed based on soil test   report .





Weed



Destroy all the weeds from the plot by deep   ploughing during summer 
Remove all the perennial weeds and their   rhizomes/suckers before the onset of monsoon. 





Planting*




 


Common cultural practices: 

Use healthy, disease free cassava stem   cuttings (setts). Weeding as and when required (Field sanitation) 
Crop rotation





Nutrients



General Package of practices recommendation is   NPK @100:50:100 kg/ha + FYM @12.5 t/ha. Apply full FYM along with full P at   the time of land preparation and planting. Half N and half K within 15 days   of sprouting the setts and the remaining half N and K within 45 days of first   application 
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test   recommendations.





Weeds



Weed control ground cover mulch can be used   over the mounds/ridges/furrows after first interculture and fertilizer   application (45-60 days after planting) 
Hand weeding twice during 30-45 days and 60-75   days
Application of pre emergent herbicide   oxyflourfen @ 0.2kg/ha (Either of the above can be adopted)





Insect pests and diseases



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 

Cultural control: 

Use of pests and diseases free planting   material 
Storing the stems in a vertical position under   shade. 
Destroy infested stems 

Biological control: 

Incorporate 1kg of Trichoderma enriched .farm   yard manure (FYM) per plant ( 107 cfu/g of FYM) 





Vegetative stage




 


Common cultural practices: 

Field sanitation ( Frequent weeding), removal   of infected/ infested plants 
Provide irrigation at critical stages of the   crop (Water requirement is 3mm/day. Provide half to one litre water per plant   during summer months. Avoid water logging 
Judicious use of fertilizers as mentioned   above 
Common mechanical practices: 
Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre 

Common biological practices: 

Conserve natural enemies through ecological   engineering
Augmentative release of natural enemies





Nutrient



In general, fertilizers may be applied as   mentioned in ( General recommendation of NPK @100:50:100 kg NPK+FYM@12.5   t/ha).
NPK based on soil test report of soil organic carbon, soil   available P and K. 
Otherwise, if the N,P,K content of the soil is   found high, apply 75% of the POP, if medium, apply the rate as per POP and   if low apply 25% more of POP. 
Apply full P at the time of land preparation 
Half N and half K within 15 days of sett   sprouting 
Remaining half N and half K within 45 days of   first application. 
If Azospirillum and Phosphobacterium is used,   the dose of N and P can be reduced to 50%. They are applied @ 5g each per plant within   one week of sprouting the setts. A time gap of 5-10days is given between   fertilizer and biofertilizer application.





Weed



If weed control ground cover mulch (the same   sheet can be used for five consecutive seasons) is used, it will take care of   the weed management till harvest 
Other weed control measures as mentioned above   also can be adopted





Whitefly



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices. 

Cultural control: 

Remove alternate host 

Mechanical control: 

Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 traps / acre 

Biological methods:

Conserve and augment biocontrol agents. 
Spray 0.5% Neem oil.





Red spider mites



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices 

Cultural control: 

Regular field monitoring for pest and defender   population. Use sprinkler irrigation 

Biological control: 

Conserve and augment biocontrol agents. 
Spray 0.5% neem oil formulation (Eg.   ICAR-CTCRI developed biopesticide Nanma) .





Mealybug



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices 

Cultural control: 

Monitoring to detect early presence of the   mealy bug. 
Pruning and burning of infested branches. 
Removal of weeds/alternate host plants .. 
.Prevention of the movement of ants and   destruction of already existing ant colonies. 
Cleaning of farm implements before moving it   to the uninfested crop. 

Biological control: 

Conserve and augment biocontrol agents.





Scale insects



Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices 

Cultural control: 

Initiate control measures during early stages   of pest infestation.

Biological control: 

·   Spraying of 0.5% of neem oil formulations.





Cassava mosaic disease



Using virus free healthy planting material 
Removal of infected stems left out in the   field to avoid source of inoculums 
Using CMD resistant variety, Sree Padmanabha





Brown leaf spot



Field sanitation 
Crop rotation 
Spraying mancozeb 0.2% after the first   appearance of the symptom three times at fortnight interval.





Tuber initiation




Nutrient



In laterite and red soils, MgSO4 @ 20kg/ha,   ZnSO4 @ 12.5 kg/ha and Borax @ 10 kg/ha can be applied after 2 months of   planting cassava, 
In saline and calcareous soils of Tamil Nadu,   lime induced Fe chlorosis can be corrected by foliar application of 1% ferrous   sulphate along with 1% Zinc sulphate 
Is any S deficiency is noted apply S@10-20   kg/ha S as elemental S or gypsum or use of sulphur containing fertilizers   like ammonium sulphate, single super phosphate or potassium sulphate 
For soil test based application of Mg, Zn and   B (see Table 1,2,3)





Weed



Keep the field weed free. As described above





Whitefly



Follow common cultural, mechanical, biological   methods





Termites



Follow common cultural, mechanical, biological   methods 

Cultural control: 

Apply well rotten FYM only to discourage   termite infestation. 
Use of crude oil emulsion to destroy the   termite colony in the termatorium. 

Mechanical control: 

Dismantle termitaria (termite mounds) around   field and kill the termite queen. 

Biological control: 

Spray Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN)





Tuber development stage




Cassava tuber rot



Removal of infected tubers 
Deep ploughing with chisel plough 
Ridge planting 
Good drainage and controlled irrigation 
Soil application of neem cake, and Trichoderma   viride 
Follow common cultural, mechanical and   biological practices





Note: The dosages of pesticides use are based on high volume sprayer
