ICAR Rabi season Agro Advisory for Himachal Pradesh

 is predominantly a hilly state, where majority area (about 80 %) is rainfed. During Rabi season wheat among cereals, chickpea & lentil among pulses and sarson among vegetables are predominant crops. Among vegetables, cole crops, peas, onion, and garlic are the main crops. Some important advisories to harness optimum returns are advocated for farmers.

Wheat


HS 542, HPW 360 cultivars of wheat are recommended for low and mid hill zone of the state under early sown conditions (Up to 20th October) whereas HPW 155, HPW 349, HPW 249, HPW 236, VL 907, HS 507, HPW 368 are recommended for timely sown conditions (15 October- 15 November) in these zones. For late sown conditions (up to December end) VL 892, HPW 373 can be grown in low and mid hill conditions. HPW 155 and HPW 236 are recommended cultivars of wheat for high hill zone and Saptdhara and Him Pratham (DH 114) for high snow-covered areas under timely sown conditions (1-15th October).
The sowing should be done in lines with spacing of 22 cm with seed rate of 100 Kg/ha and 150 Kg /ha for timely and late sown conditions respectively. Before sowing treat the seed with Bavistin @ 2.5 g/kg of seed. Apply full quantity of SSP (375Kg), MOP (50 Kg) along with 50 per cent of Urea (130 Kg) along with FYM at the time of sowing while remaining half quantity of Urea should be given at the time of crown root initiation or occurrence of first rain.
Since, weed causes heavy economic loss to the wheat crop and to avoid these losses, Vesta @ 400g/ ha or Chlodinafop @ 400g/ha followed by 2, 4- D @ 1.25 kg/ha after 2-3 days of Clodinofop spray are recommended for chemical management of weed problems. The spray should be done after the appearance of 2-3 leaf stage in weeds.
Among diseases yellow rust and Karnal bunt are major problem in wheat crop which can be managed by the spray of Tilt @ 1ml per liter of water at the appearance of the symptoms. Termite is major pest among all pests in this crop and seed treatment with with chloropyriphos 20 EC @ 4ml/Kg seed along with soil incorporation of chloropyriphos 20 EC @ 2 L mixing with 25 Kg sand/ha at the time of sowing is recommended for the management of this pest.

Chickpea


Himachal chana -1, Himachal chana-2, GPF-2, Palam chana-1, HPG 17 are the recommended cultivars of chickpea. Treat the seeds with fungicide (Bavistin @2.5gm/Kg of seed) and biofertilizers like Rhizobium and Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria before sowing. Go for sowing of crop at proper soil moisture. Mid October is the best time for it’s sowing, and sowing should be done in lines with 30 cm line spacing for all cultivars except HPG 17 for which line spacing of 50 cm is recommended with optimum depth of 10-12.5 cm. The seed rate for small &amp; medium sized seeded chickpea cultivars like Himachal chana -1, Himachal chana-2, GPF-2, Palam chana-1 is 40-45 Kg/ha however, for bold seeded cultivars like HPG 17, seed rate of 80Kg/ha is recommended. Urea 65 Kg, SSP 375Kg and 50Kg MOP per ha is recommended for the cultivation of chickpea. The full dose of SSP, MOP and half dose of Urea should be applied at the time of sowing while reaming half dose of Urea should be given to crop after 4-5 weeks of sowing.
For the management of pod borer in chickpea, spray the crop with Carbaryl 50 WP @1250 gm/ha and apply bavistin @1g / L of water for the management of Acochyta blight.

Lentil


Vipasha and Markandey are the recommended cultivars of Lentil which can be sown between October end to mid November with seed rate of 25-30Kg/ha. Urea 22Kg and SSP 250Kg/ha is recommended fertilizers which can be applied at the time of sowing.

Brown sarson and Gobhi Sarson


KBS 3, HPBS 1 and HPN 3, ONK 1, GSC 7 are the recommended cultivars of Brown and Gobhi Sarson respectively. First fortnight of October is the best time for the cultivation of these crops.
The seed rate of 6Kg/ha is required, and sowing should be done with spacing of 30 cm line to line and 10 cm plant to plant. For brown sarson, apply full does of SSP (250Kg), MOP (65 Kg), Gipsum (140 Kg) along with 50% of Urea (65Kg) at the time of sowing while remaing dose of Urea should be applied before flowering. For Gobhi sarson, apply full does of SSP (375Kg), MOP (65 Kg) and 50% dose of Urea (125Kg) during sowing time and rest of Urea should be applied in two splits after 60 days and 80-90 days after sowing.
Two manual weeding are required between 40-70 days of sowing for the management of weeds. Spray of Pendimethalin (Stomp 30 EC) @ 1.5 Kg /ha as a pre-emergence or Isoproturon @ 1Kg/ha in 700-800 l of water as post emergence (30-35 days of sowing) is recommended for the chemical method of weed management.
Aphid is the major pest associated with this crop, which can be managed by the spray of methyl Demeton 25 EC or dimethoate 30 EC @ 1ml/L of water. 

Winter vegetable 

Cole Crops (cauliflower, cabbage, and broccoli)

Nursery sowing of Cabbage hybrids (Pusa cabbage hybrid 1, Pusa cabbage hybrid-81, Varun, Pushkar) should be completed in August–September in low and mid hills for healthy seedlings on raised beds or poly trays or under protected structure, while transplanting should be completed from October – January. Nursery sowing of Broccoli varieties/ hybrids (Palam Samridhi, Palam Haritika, Palam Kanchan, Palam Vachitra, KTS-I and Punjab Broccoli-I.) should be completed in September to October in low &amp; Mid hills.
Apply FYM@ 200 -250 q per ha at the time of field preparation, NPK @120-180: 75-80: 60-75 kg per ha. Full dose of phosphorus and one-third of N and half of potassium should be applied at the time of transplanting. Remaining part of N should be top dressed at an interval of one month each while half of potassium is to be applied along with N during second top dressing. Borex can be added in the soil for the management of browning in cauliflower
First light irrigation should be given immediately after transplanting of the seedlings and regular maintenance of optimum moisture is essential during growth and curd development. The harvesting of curds is to be done as soon as the curds attain prime maturity and compactness
Harvesting of broccoli heads at correct time i.e., before the buds open and when the bud clusters are compact
Damping off of seedlings is major problem in cole crops and for its control applies Mancozeb 25 g + carbendazim 10 g per 10 litres of water. Seed treatment with hot water (50 0C) and streptocycline (1g/ 10 L water) for 30 minutes each is advised for protection against black rot. In case of attack of aphids and cabbage butterfly, malathion @ 1ml/ L can be applied. Cypermethin @1mlL can be applied for protection against cut worms at early stage.
