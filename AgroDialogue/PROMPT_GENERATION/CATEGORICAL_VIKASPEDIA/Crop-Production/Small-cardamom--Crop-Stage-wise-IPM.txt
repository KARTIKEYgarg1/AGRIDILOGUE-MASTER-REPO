Small cardamom: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Deep summer ploughing of fi elds to control resting stages of insect   pests. • Follow crop rotation with non-host crops • Field sanitation, rogueing • Destroy the alternate host plants • Sow the ecological engineering plants • Sow/plant sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around cumin crop as a   guard/barrier crop • Removal and destruction of alternate host weeds


Soil   borne pathogens nematodes and resting stages of insects
Cultural control: • Practice green manuring and intercropping with redgram for the control of   root rot. Biological control: • Apply neem cake @ 100 Kg/acre at the time of transplanting for reducing   capsule borer damage



Seedling/nursery*




Common cultural practices: • Grow resistant/tolerant varieties • Use healthy, certifi ed and weed seed free seeds/suckers/planting   material. • Destruction of infested plants • Do not use the same site repeatedly for raising the seedlings • Raise nurseries away from main plantations to reduce possibilities of   infestation and re infestation from the nearby infested plantations. • Provide adequate drainage facilities.


I. Primary nursery
• Seed treatment with acid or   similar chemicals improves germination. Acid scarifi cation with 25 per cent nitric acid for 10 minutes to break the seed coat will   enhance germination. • Fumigate the beds with 2% formalin (10 liters per bed) 10 days before   sowing • After extraction of seeds wash through water to avoiding mucilage and mix   with wood ash for shade drying. • Bed size should be 6 m in length, 1 m width and 20 cm height after timely   sowing and planting. • 30-50 g seeds should be recommended per bed. • Select the suckers of high yielding varieties suiting to the   location. • Select the virus free planting material, vegetative propagation through   suckers is the best method.


Weeds
• Use vegetative mulches to   avoid weed growth in nursery. • Weeds should be removed manually as and when required


II.   Secondary nursery
• Prepare beds as in primary   nursery • Fumigate the beds with 2% formalin (10 l per bed) 10 days before   sowing • Mixing of well decomposed cattle manure and wood ash with the top layer   of the soil will help the seedlings to establish well and to grow vigorously • Shade pandals should be provided before transplanting. • Mulching the bed with dry leaves will help to conserve soil   moisture. • Regular watering during dry months, weeding, application of fertilizers, control   of pests and diseases.


Weeds
• Mulching should be done to   check the growth of weeds. • Weeds should be removed by using hand tools/hoeing during May, September   and December months.


Rhizome weevil**
Cultural control: • Provide suffi cient organic manures to encourage better vegetative   growth.


Shoot fly**
Cultural control: • Provide suffi cient shade to the plants.


Shoot borer
Cultural control: • Rogueing and destruction of infested tillers during September-October


Root-knot   nematode
Cultural control: • Nursery should be raised in nematode free sites or fumigated or solarized   beds. • The roots should be pruned prior to distribution or transplanting. • Avoiding planting of alternate hosts such as banana, colocasia and   jackfruit Biological control: • Soil application of neem cake @ 500 g/plant.


Damping   off or seedling rot
Cultural control: • In the primary nursery, practice thin sowing for avoiding overcrowding of   seedlings. Chemical control: • Spray/drench the soil with fosetyl-AL 80% WP @ 900-1200 g in 300-400 l of   water/acre


Primary   nursery leaf spot
Cultural control: • Raise nursery in fertile soil. • Avoid direct sunlight on nursery beds. Use agro shade net. • Early sowing of seeds in August-September will ensure mature seedlings   which are less prone to diseases during south west monsoon. Chemical control: • Spray/drench the soil after germination of seedlings with copper   oxy-chloride @ 1 g in 300-400 l of water/acre


Secondary   nursery leaf spot**/ Cercospora leaf spot
Cultural control: • Cardamom seeds should be sown in the month of August – September, to   ensure suffi cient growth of seedlings, so that seedlings develop suffi cient tolerance to the   disease. Chemical control: • Spray/drench the soil with copper oxy-chloride 50% WP @ 1 Kg in 300-400 l   of water/acre


‘Katte’   or mosaic or marble disease
Cultural control: • Fill the gaps with healthy disease free materials.



Plantation   stage




Common cultural practices: • Collect and destroy crop debris. • Avoid water logging. • Regulate shade in thickly shaded areas. • Avoid water stress during fl owering stage. • Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval   parasitoids are observed. • Remove and destroy collateral/alternate hosts such as castor, ginger,   turmeric in the immediate vicinity. • Maintain optimum plant density. • Ensure adequate shade of 65-70% in endemic areas and irrigate the crop   before attaining critical period. • Fill gaps with healthy disease free materials. • Mulching the plant basins with green leaves and other organic materials   during summer months conserves and maintains the population of native benefi cial microfl   ora.



Common mechanical   practices: • Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant   parts. • Collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae. • Handpick the older larvae during early stages of crop. • The infested shoots may be collected and destroyed. • Handpick the gregarious caterpillars and the cocoons which are found on   stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water. • Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre. • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm. • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks). • Encouragement of golden backed woodpecker and crow-pheasant in the   plantation and erect of bird perches @ 20/acre to attract birds of economic importance   in biological control. Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering. • Augmentative release of natural enemies.


Nutrients
• Application of organic manures   such as FYM, cow dung or compost @ 5 Kg/plant or neem cake @ 1-2 Kg / plant may be done during June-July. • The present recommendation of nutrients for cardamom is N:P2O5:K2O @   30:30:60 Kg/ acre. • The fertilizers may be applied in two split doses, before and after the   southwest monsoon, in a circular band of 20 cm wide and 30-40 cm away from the base of the   clumps, and mixed with soil.


Weeds
• Three rounds of hand tool   weeding during May, September and December/January • Slash weeding by use of power mower in the inter row space. • Use of spade for weeding is to be avoided as it will loosen the soil and   cause soil erosion. • The weeded materials may be used for mulching.


Cardamom   thrips
• Follow the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Removal of dry drooping leaves as well as dry leaf sheath (trashing)   during January- February. • Destruction of collateral host plants. • Detrashing and weeding reduce thrips infestation. Biological control: • Release Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi @ 2 larvae/plant in early stage of   the plant and 4 larvae/plant in later stage Chemical control: • Spray quinalphos 25% EC @ 240-480 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or   phenthoate 50% EC @ 200 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or diafenthiuron 50% WP @ 320 g in 400   l of water/ acre or monocrotophos 36% SL @ 374.8 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre


Shoot   borer
• Follow the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Castor seeds 0.4-0.8 Kg/acre may be sown as trap crop in open areas/   boundary. • Rogueing and destruction of infested tillers during September-October. Mechanical control: • Castor infl orescence with capsules infested by shoots and capsule may be   collected and destroyed. • Use of pheromones in the monitoring of the pest and therefore correct   timing of application of biorationals shall be recommended. Biological control: • Application of Bacillus thuringiensis when early-instar larvae are found   in capsule or panicle or unopened lead buds i.e., within 20 days of adult moth emergence.


Early   capsule borer
• Follow the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Mechanical control: • Clipping the infl orescence/fl ower parts of alternate hosts viz.,   Alpinia speciosa, A.mutica, Amomum ghaticum, A. pterocarpum, Curcuma heilyherrensis, Hedydium   ceranarium during off season (December to May). Chemical control: • Diafenthiuron 50% WP @ 320 g in 400 l of water/acre


White   grub/root grub
• Follow the common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Avoid planting of jack, mango, fi g etc. as shade trees as these trees   are alternate hosts of the pest. • Mulching of plant base with leaves of wild Helianthus sp. to prevent egg   laying of adult beetles. • Earthing up and detrashing. • Irrigation @15–20 l per plant reduces root grub population. Mechanical control: • Set up light trap @ 1/acre. Biological control: • Local strain of EPN (Heterorhabditis indica) application @ 1,00,000   nematodes (IJS) / plant
