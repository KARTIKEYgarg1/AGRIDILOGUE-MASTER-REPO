Turmeric: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activities



Pre-sowing*



Nutrients
• Turmeric crop requires clean   cultivation and fi ne tilth. • Turmeric needs very heavy manuring during the four months period after   planting. Crop requires 120 Kg N, 50 Kg P2O5 and 80 Kg K 2O per acre in organic and inorganic forms. • The NPK requirement has to be applied in two or three splits. The first   dose of N has to be applied before planting through inorganic sources. • Use 10 t/ acre Farmyard manure or 4 t / acre vermicompost at the time of   field preparation. • Apply castor or neem cake @ 200 Kg/ acre. • Incorporate manure / compost in soil at 2 -3 weeks before planting. • Use coir compost @ 1 t/acre combined with FYM, biofertilizers   (Azospirillum). • Use leguminous green manure crops like pigeon pea, black gram, cowpea,   cluster bean and French bean and incorporate in soil before planting.


Weeds
• Deep summer ploughing and   solarisation during summer reduces weed infestation, soil borne diseases,   nematodes, etc. • Use raised beds (30 cm with 1 meter width). • At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to   minimize weeds menace in field.


Pests,   nematode, soil borne pathogens and other diseases
Cultural control: • Deep summer ploughing during summer. • Soil solarization: Cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45   mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will   help in reducing the soil borne pests. Biological control: • At the time of planting, apply 25 g powdered neem cake and mix well with   the soil in each pit taken at a spacing of 20-25 cm within and between rows   or application of neem cake @ 2 t/ acre is also desirable.


Rhizome rot/ soft rot
Cultural control: • Use of resistant varieties to rhizome wilt/ rot. • Crop rotation with maize, cotton, soybean. • Planting of disease-free seed rhizomes. • Use raised beds of 30 cm height. • Flooding treatment for 30 days, soil solarisation during hottest months   for 60 days • Treat the rhizomes with hot water at 51° C for 10 minutes. • Rhizomes treatment can be done by keeping them under clear polythene   sheet under direct sunlight for raising the temperature 48o C and this temperature is retained for 30 minutes. • Use bio-fumigation using cabbage and mustard plant refuses. • Use raised beds of 15-30 cm height, 1 m width and of convenient length   may be prepared giving at least 50 cm spacing between beds. Biological control: • Planting of perennial / seasonal flowering plants like basil, marigold,   fennel, sunflower etc. along the border to attract and enhance the population   of biocontrol agents for managing pests/disease. • Application of pine needle and neem cake powder treatments @ 100 Kg/ acre   (in two splits) • Application of oil cakes made from Azadirachta indica, Calophyllum   inophyllum, Pongamia glabra, Hibiscus sabdariffa and Brassica campestris @   0.8 tonnes/ acre


Bacterial wilt**
Cultural control: • Soil solarisation for 60 days during summer • Planting of disease-free seed rhizomes. • Use crop rotation with non-host crops like ragi, paddy, maize, sorghum   etc. • Avoid crop rotation with tomato, potato, chillies, brinjal and peanut, as   these plants are hosts for the wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. • Rhizome treatment with hot water 47oC for 3 minutes. • Use bio-fumigation using cabbage and mustard plant refuses. • Avoid over irrigation, and flood irrigation in disease affected   areas. • It is sensitive to high pH (alkaline soils).



Planting/ seedling   stage*



Nutrients
• The NPK requirement has to be   applied in two or three splits. The first dose of N has to be applied before   planting through inorganic sources. • Apply P2O5 @ 24 Kg/acre as basal   dose at the time of planting/ sowing. • Apply K2O   @ 16 Kg/acre as basal dose at the time of planting/ sowing. • In zinc deficient areas, apply zinc sulphate @ 8 Kg/acre.


Weeds
• Green mulching: The first   mulching is done at the time of planting with green leaves @ 4.8- 6 tones   /acre. Mulching is to be repeated @ 3 tones /acre at 45 and 90 days after   planting, immediately after weeding, application of fertilizers and earthing   up.


Rhizome rot/soft rot
Cultural control: • Maintain proper drainage by using 30 cm raised bed and avoiding the water   stagnation • Adopt phyto sanitary measures like infected plants should be uprooted and   destroyed. • Adopt crop rotation with non-host crops like ragi, paddy, maize, sorghum   etc. • Mulching with green leaves (Lantana camara and Vitex negundo) @ 4- 4.8   t/acre at the time of planting. (It is repeated @ 5 t/acre 40 and 90 days   after planting). Biological control: • Foliar application of neem oil @ 0.5% twice at fortnightly   interval. • Cow dung slurry or liquid manure may be poured on the bed after each   mulching to enhance microbial activity and nutrient availability Use   Fermented Plant Extract (FPE) prepared by using (garlic + onion leaves +   Canabis sp + wild poisonous plant) + (cow urine) + (EM solution) + (extract   after washing polished rice) + (alcohol) + (water) (1:1:1:1:1:15), sufficient   for 1.0 ha for seed treatment against soft rot. • FPE to be applied after every fortnight by using watering can for next 2   month i.e. up to July end.


Rhizome-scale
Cultural control: • Collect and destroy severely infested rhizomes. • Collect and destroy damaged leaves • Select healthy rhizomes free from scale infestation for using sowing   purpose



Vegetative   &amp; rhizome development stage






Nutrients
• Top dressing of N in three   splits is done at regular periods just after each weeding at monthly   intervals. • Apply castor or neem cake @ 200 Kg/ acre (if not applied at sowing) along   with 24 Kg of Nitrogen through urea near the rhizomes at 40 days after   planting. • Apply 24 Kg nitrogen and 16 Kg potash/ acre at 80 days after   planting. • The final dose of 20 Kg nitrogen and 14 Kg potash/ acre should be applied   at 120 days after planting followed by eating up of the crop. • Fertilizer application should be completed within 120 days from the time   of planting. • Chemical fertilizers should be applied along with FYM and organic   cakes. • As and when micro-nutrient deficiencies like zinc, manganese etc., are   observed, it should be corrected by foliar spray. • Spray ferrous sulphate @ 5.0 g along with lime salt @ 1.0 g per litre of   water to control ‘Fe’ deficiency. • To control ‘Zn’ deficiency, zinc sulphate @ 5.0 g + 0.5 ml sticking agent   per litter of water.


Weeds
• Hand hoeing and weeding are   necessary at 60, 90, 120 and 150 days after planting in light soils.   Immediately the plants have to be earthed up. • In black soils where ridge and furrow method of planting and wider   spacing are adopted country plough can be worked for earthing up and removal   of weeds and followed by weeding in the lines.
