Grapes: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre sowing Stage*




Common cultural practices: • Deep ploughing of fields during summer to control nematodes population,   to expose pupae and popagules of soil borne pathogens. • Soil solarization can be done for sterilizing the nursery mixture • Timely sowing should be done. • Field sanitation, rogueing. • Destroy the alternate host plants as well as crop debris • Crop rotation with non-cereals. • Adopt ecological engineering by growing the attractant, repellent, and   trap crops around the field bunds.


Nutrients
• The rooted grapevine cuttings   are planted in pits at an appropriate spacing depending on the soil,   agro-climatic conditions and varieties. • Grape is a heavy feeder of nutrients. Nutrient should be supplied on the   basis of soil test report, varieties and recommendation for the particular   agro-climatic zone. • The land should be ploughed well and raise a green manure viz., sunhemp   during monsoon and incorporate in-situ in August and September.


Weeds
Cultural control: • Plough the field in summer/ before planting to destroy existing weeds in   the field. • Grow the green manure crop to suppress weeds in rainy season. Chemical control: • 2,4-D Sodium salt Technical @ 1 Kg in 200 l of water/acre • Diuron 80% WP@ 0.8 Kg in 250 l of water/acre • Paraquat dichloride 24% SL@ 0.8 l in 200 l of water/acre


Defoliators/   Subterranean pests Soil- borne- Pathogen
Cultural control: • Rabbing with paddy husk/ straw. • For others follow common cultural practices



Sowing stage*



Nutrients
• At the time of planting, fill   up the pits with well decomposed farmyard manure @ 50 Kg per pit mixed with   top soil, Trichoderma species and AM @ 50g inoculum / plant.


Weeds
• Use weed free seedling for   planting. • Remove existing weeds in and around the pits at the time of   planting. • Provide plastic or straw mulch around the seedling to prevent weed growth   and to conserve moisture.


Root-knot nematode
Cultural control: • Intercropping of marigold reduces nematode population • Nursery should be raised in nematode free sites or fumigated or solarized   beds • Repellant plants: Marigold • Follow common cultural practices. • Application of decomposed poultry manure @ 200g / sq. m


Leaf blight Anthracnose
Cultural control: • Irrigation by rose can. • Use of resistant varieties such as– Bangalore Blue, Beauty Seedless,   Bharat Early, Golden queen, Large white. Chemical control: For anthracnose • Aureofungin 46.15%w/v. SP@ 0.005%, 300 l/acre or benomyl 50% WP@120 g in   250-280 l of water/acre or Carbendazim 50%WP@ 120 g in 240 l of water/acre or   chlorothalonil 75% WP@ 0.2% or 200 g in 100lof water /acre or iprodione 50%   WP@ 0.4-0.8 Kg in 200 l of water/acre or kitazin 48% EC @ 0.20%or 200 ml in   200 l of water As required depending upon crop stage and plant protection   equipment used or mancozeb75%WP @ 0.6-0.8 Kg in 300 l of water/acre or   ziram80%WP@ 0.6-0.8 Kg in 300-400 l of water/acre



Vegetative stage




Common cultural practices: • Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • Avoid water stress   and water stagnation conditions. • Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval   parasitoids are observed Common mechanical practices: • Collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae • Removal and destruction of dead vines along with root system from the   garden is essential as this reduces the build up of inoculum (fungal   population). • Collect and destroy diseased and insect infected plant parts • Use blue sticky traps for thrips @ 4-20 traps/acre. • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5 traps/acre • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such   as King crow, common mynah etc. • Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies.

 • Apply nutrients through combination of organic manures (40%) and   Inorganic fertilizers (60%). • In both the seasons prior to pruning the top 15 to 20 cm soil in the   basin is dug out and heaped around the trunk. Organic manures are spread   uniformly in the basins and then fertilizers are applied and covered with   soil. • Apply fertilizers around root feeding zone i.e. at about 15 cm depth and   60 cm away from the trunk.
 



Weeds
• Regular weeding is important   during the young stage of plants. • Break the crust with hand hoe each time after irrigation. • Plough the area between the basins during the pre-monsoon, post-monsoon   periods. • Integrated weed management including cover crops, judicious use of   herbicides, intercropping and hand weeding wherever necessary should be   adopted. • Under highly weed infested orchards, apply 2, 4-D Sodium salt Technical   (having 2, 4-D acid 80 % w/w) @ 1lit per acre in 200 l water to control   broadleaf weeds or apply Diuron 80% WP @ 0.8 Kg per acre in 250 l water to   control wide range of weeds or paraquat dichloride 24% SL @ 0.8 Kg/ acre in   200 l water as post-emergence directed inter row application at 2-3 leaf   stage of grasses, sedges and broad leaf weeds.

Leaf eating caterpillar
Cultural control: • Growing of castor as trap crop all around the vineyard for oviposition.    • Follow common cultural and mechanical practices.  Biological control: • Spraying NSKE 5 % against eggs and first instar larva • Follow common biological practices


Stem borer/cane borer
Cultural control: • Piercing the infested plants with   a sharp needle or knife to kill the caterpillar in the stem. • Remove loose bark at the time of   pruning to prevent egg laying • Follow common cultural   practices. Biological control: • Follow common biological   practices.


Hoppers
Cultural Control: • Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum or pearl millet to reduce   hopper infestations. • Keep the nursery area clean, free of weeds and grasses to keep away the   grass hoppers. • Removal of weeds and alternate hosts plants like hibiscus, okra, custard   apple, guava etc. in vineyards. Biological control: • Follow common biological practices. Chemical control: • Spray oxydemeton–methyl 25% EC @ 400 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre


Mealybugs
Cultural control: • Removal of weeds and alternate host plants like hibiscus, okra, custard   apple, guava etc in and nearby vineyards throughout the year. • Deep ploughing in summer or raking of soil in vineyards helps to destroy   its nymphal stages and minimizing the incidence. Mechanical control: • Remove and destroy the loose bark. Biological control: • Release exotic predator, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri @ 10   beetles/vine • Neem based, emulsifiable water soluble formulations can be sprayed. Doses   depend on azadirachtin concentrations in formulations viz., 50000 ppm   formulation is sprayed at 1ml / l, while that with 10000 ppm and 3000 ppm can   be sprayed at 2.5 ml and 5 ml per l, respectively. Chemical control: • Buprofezin25%SC@400-600 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or methomyl40%SP@   500 g in 200-400 l of water/acre


Flea beetle
Cultural control: • Remove the loose bark at the time of pruning to prevent egg laying. • Shake vines to dislodge adult beetles, collect into trays containing   kerosenated water (1 kerosene: 9 water) and destroy them. • Put bundles of dry shreds of banana on the pruned end of the vines in the   evening. Beetles, which take shelter on these at night, can be shaken and   collected in the morning and kill them. • Use high quality, large, vigorous seed- the quicker a seedling can establish   itself the more damage it can withstand from flea beetles. • Seed early - a plant that establishes quickly can ward off flea beetles   more effectively. Caution advised if high populations are seen early in   fields when planting. Crops must be monitored daily upon emergence for   damage. • Crop rotation - flea beetles over-winter along field edges and migrate so   following a crop rotation does not make your crop immune to flea beetles, but   if problems with flea beetles persisted the year before,planting canola again   will contribute to high populations once again. • Direct seeding - provides a microclimate that warms slower than a   conventionally seeded crop. Cooler temperatures slow flea beetle activity,   reducing damage. • Increase seeding rates - increased plant populations means less damage to   each specific plant. • Wider row spacing - reduces the attractiveness to the flea beetles Mechanical control: • Follow common practices. • Setting up of light trap @ 1/acre (6-10 pm). Botanical control: • Neem based, emulsifiable water soluble formulations can be sprayed. Doses   depend on azadirachtin concentrations in formulations viz., 50000 ppm   formulation is sprayed at 1ml / l, while that with 10000 ppm and 3000 ppm can   be sprayed at 2.5 ml and 5 ml per liter dose, respectively. Chemical control: • Imidacloprid17.8%SL@120-160 ml in 400 l of water/acre or   lambda-Cyhalothrin 4.9%CS @100 g in 200-400 l of water/acre or malathion50%   EC@400 ml in 600-800 l of water/acre


Chafer beetle
Cultural control: • Eliminate hibernating site • Follow common practices. Chemical control: • Malathion50% EC @ 400 ml in 600-800 l of water/acre


Girdle   beetle/Grape cane girdler
Cultural control: • Cutting of infested shoot bellow the lower girdle before adult emerge in   the summer and destroy them may help to reduce the population of   insects. • If low levels of grape cane borer are present in your vineyard, populations   can be reduced by cultural practices such as removal and destruction of   affected canes and excess dead wood from the canopy during pruning. Chemical control: • Malathion 50% EC @ 400 ml in 600-800 l of water/acre


Thrips
Cultural control: • Install 4-20blue sticky coloured traps per acre to monitor thrips   population. • Deep ploughing in summer or raking of soil in vineyards helps to destroy   its nymphal stages and minimizing the incidence. • Removal of weeds and alternate host plants like hibiscus, okra, custard   apple, guava etc. in and nearby vineyards in and around the vineyards   throughout the year. • Collect and destroy damaged leaves, fruits and flowers. Chemical control: • Emamectin benzoate 5% SG @ 88 g in 200-400 l of water/acre or fipronil   80%WG @ 20-25 g in 300-400 l of water/acre or lambda-cyhalothrin 4.9% CS @100   g in 200-400 l of water/acre


Mite
Cultural control: • Proper irrigation scheduling reduces the water stress and also increases   the humidity thereby reducing the mite population Biological control: • Several predatory insects and spiders feed on mites but the most efficient   natural predators of mite pests are predatory mites.


Leaf folder/Leaf roller
Cultural control: • Simple method to control the pest population is to collect and burn the   infested leaves. Biological control: • Follow common practices.


Powdery mildew
Cultural control: • Cultural practices that reduce humidity within the vineyard, enable good   air circulation through the canopy, and provide good light exposure to all   leaves and clusters aid in managing powdery mildew. • Use an under vine irrigation system and manage it carefully, excess can   favour the disease Chemical control: • Benomyl50 % WP @ 120 g in 250-280 l of water/acre or carbendazim 46.27%   SC@ 0.1% or 100ml, 100l/acre or dinocap 48% EC@ 90 ml in 300 l of water/acre   or flusilazole 40% EC@ 0.01% Asrequired depending upon the stage of crop and   type of plants protection equipment used or hexaconazole2%SC@ 0.6-1.2 l in   200-300 l of water/acre or hexaconazole 5% EC@ 200-400 ml in 200 l of   water/acre or kresoxim-methyl 44.3% SC@ 240-280 ml in 200 l of water/acre or   lime sulphur 22% SC @This liquid is used at one per cent in conventional   sprayers: Doses 0.8-1 l/acre or myclobutanil 10% WP @ 0.04%, 200 l /acre or   penconazole 10% EC@ 50ml/100Lt. water, Depending upon the requirement or   sulphur 40% WP@ 1.2 Kg in 400 l of water/acre or sulphur 55.16 % SC @ 0.30%   or 300 ml/100 l water as required or sulphur 80% WP@ 1-2 Kg in 300-400 l of   water/acre or Sulphur 80% WG@ 0.75-1 Kg in 300-400 l of water/acre or sulphur   85% DP @ 6-8 Kg/acre or triadimefon 25% WP@ 0.010% in 300 l of water,   depending upon the requirement

Powdery   mildew, Downy mildew
Cultural control: • Remove abnormal un-harvested bunches from vines and burn them. • Remove all shoots emerging from the crown near ground. • Shoots hanging from trellises towards ground should be tied on trellises   or can be removed if they are extra. Chemical control: • Same as vegetative stage


Blight,   Anthracnose, Bitter rot and Bacterial leaf spot
Cultural control: • Promote good air circulation and   light penetration by controlling weeds and suckers, proper pruning, and   positioning or removing shoots for uniform leaf development. • Where possible, rows should be   planted in the direction of the prevailing wind. Good air circulation and   light penetration will promote faster drying of plant parts and reduce   disease incidence.  • Prevent wounding of berries by controlling insects, birds and other grape   diseases.


Botrytis rot
Cultural control: • Careful handling in the field, pre-cooling and refrigeration helps in   controlling the disease. • Pruning and thinning of the vineyard reduces • Humidity around the   clusters.


Blue rot
Cultural control: • Avoiding injuries to the ripe berries helps to reduce soft rot. • Clean planting stock; (i) Disease wood removal and immediate burning;   (ii) fungicide application at shoot extension and later if temperatures are   cool.


Birds. Bats
Cultural: • Remove nesting and roosting areas • Bird patrols: takes time and energy but still effective, wear bright   colors • Pyrotechnics – bombs and whistlers • Whistles: Thunderer is the Cadillac of whistles • Site selection: no trees, open fields • Noise makers: propane canons, electronic scare devices • Nets: still the best option for full protection • Traps • Tape, balloons, kites, etc. • Trap crops



Postharvest



Black   mould Rot, blue mould rot, green mould rot, botrytis rot
Cultural control: • Careful handling and prompt refrigeration to 1-2 ºC or below prevents the   disease in storage. • Inclusion of SO2 releasing pads in the boxes while packing helps to   control the disease.


Rhizopus rot
Cultural control: • Inclusion of SO2 releasing pads in the boxes 2 while packing, removing of   diseased berries during grading, avoiding injury to the berries while packing   and handling helps to restrict the growth of fungi. • Avoiding injuries to the   ripe berries helps to reduce soft rot. Physical control: • Maintaining cold storage temperature between 40-10 ºC prevents fungal   growth.


Note: Apply Trichoderma viride/harzianum and Pseudomonas   fluorescens as soil application (If Commercial products are used, check for   label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption   in their fields, registration is not required).
