Lentil Crop Stage Wise IPM






Management
 
Activity




Pre-sowing




 


Common cultural practices:

Summer deep ploughing 
Follow crop rotation with non host crops 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Destroy the alternate host plants





Nutrients



Apply well decomposed FYM @ 4-5 tons / acre   incorporated with Trichoderma 2-3 weeks before sowing





Weeds



Destroy weeds manually or by deep summer   ploughing





Sowing




 


Common cultural practices:

Do summer ploughing 
Timely sowing should be done 
Solarize the field in summer to help reduce   the inoculums. 
Use resistant varieties 
Select seed from disease free fields





Nutrients



Seed treatment should be done with Rhizobium   culture @ 200 g/ acre. 
Fertilizers should be applied on soil test   basis. Generally, it is recommended to apply 8 to 10 kg N, 16 kg P2O5 , 8 kg   K2O, 8 kg sulphur and 6 kg ZnSO4 per acre at the time of sowing as basal   application..





Weeds



Always use certified and weed free seeds. 
Timely sowing should be done. 
Line sowing should be done to facilitate   inter-culture operations. 
Plant population should be maintained to its   optimum right from its beginning to minimize the crop weed competition. 
Adopt suitable crop rotation to minimize   dodder and orobanche weeds.





Pests, Soil-borne pathogens



Deep ploughing of fields during summer to   manage juvenile population of nematodes and insect pests. 
Soil solarization: Cover the beds with   polythene sheet of 75 gauge thickness for six weeks before sowing to reduce   the soil borne pests.





Vegetative




 


Common cultural practices:

Avoid excess application of nitrogen 
Adopt the ecological engineering strategy. 
Conserve natural enemies 
Remove and destroy weeds periodically 
Removal and destruction of infected/infested   plants





Nutrients



Correct micronutrient deficiency if any in   standing crop





Weeds



Keep field boundary &amp; bunds free from   weeds. 
The crop field should be weed free initially   for 4-5 weeks by following timely hoeing and weeding. 
Inter-culture operation/hoeing should be done   twice at 20 and 35 days after sowing-using hand hoe to remove all weeds in   between the row





Cow pea aphid


Mechanical control:

Use yellow sticky trap 

Biological control:

Conserve the predators such as Syrphid flies,   Rove beetle, Green lacewing, Ladybird beetle and parasitoids such as Aphidius   spp. Aphelinus sp.





Cut worm


Biological control:

Conserve and augment the predators and   parasitoids





Thrips


Cultural control:

Ploughing, harrowing and solarisation can kill   pupae in the soil from previously infested crops. 

Mechanical control:

Adult thrips can be monitored by mass trapping   with blue sticky traps or water pan traps in field. 

Biological control:

Conserve and augment the various biological   control agents, including minute pirate bugs, Orius spp., Big eyed predatory   bug, Geocoris sp. and entomopathogenic nematodes,





Pod borers


Biological control:

Conserve and augment biocontrol agents.





Fusarium wilt and root rot diseases


Cultural control:

Use resistant varieties (PL 406, PL 639 and PL   234) 
Follow crop rotation Weeds control 
Delayed sowing can reduce disease incidence 
Use of clean and certified seed. 
Deep ploughing over summer and removal of   infected trash can reduce inoculum levels of Fusarium wilt 

Mechanical control:

Solarisation of soil by covering the soil with   transparent polythene sheet (75 gauge) for 6-8 weeks during the summer for   effective management.





Lentil rust


Cultural control:

Use resistant varieties (PL 234, PL 406, LL   931, LL 699 and Narendra Masur-1)





Ascochyta blight


Cultural control:

Use of resistant cultivars (LL 699) 
Use of disease free seed, 
Follow crop rotation





Powdery mildew


Cultural control:

Use of resistant varieties





Mosaic virus


Cultural control:

Use of disease free seeds 

Mechanical control:

Use yellow sticky traps for vector monitoring





Reproductive




Nutrients



Incorporate crop residues in soil immediately   after harvest





Aphids



Same as vegetative stage





Lygus bug


Cultural control:

Removal of weeds along field borders to   prevent buildup of lygus bugs. 

Biological control:

Conserve and augment biocontrol agents





Cut worm and Thrips



Same as vegetative stage
