Apricot Crop Stage Wise IPM






Management
 
Activity




Pre- planting*





Common cultural practices: 

Timely planting. 
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test   recommendations





Nutrients



Nutrient should be applied on the basis of   soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
Prepare land by ploughing and harrowing.
The pits are dug in summer about a fortnight   before planting and left undisturbed. 
Pits of about 1m x 1m x 1m size are dug at a   distance of 4 to 5 meter in square system of planting. 
Apply lime in soil if pH is below 7.





Weeds



Ploughing and leveling the field before   planting to destroy existing weeds in the field.





Planting*




 


Common cultural practices:

Use healthy and certified plants
Grow resistant/tolerant varieties. 
Planting in rows with recommended spacing. 
Avoid growing in low-lying areas and flooding. 
Do not delay irrigation until the crop   exhibits moisture stress symptoms.





Nutrients



Planting is done in pits already filled with   top soil and farm yard manure during the months of Oct.-Nov. 
A basket of soil taken from old apricot   orchard is added to each pit to ensure mycorrhizal association with apricot   roots. 
At the time of planting, manures and   fertilizers are applied @ 50 Kg FYM or compost, 20 g N + 15 g P + 15 g K per   plant.





Weeds



Use weed free seedlings for planting. 
During the initial 2-4 years to suppress the   weeds between rows, leguminous crops such as pea, bean, soybean, and cowpea   and vegetables should be grown as intercrops. Remove existing weeds in and   around the pits at the time of planting.





*Apply Trichoderma viride / harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens for   treatment of seed/seedling/planting materials in the nurseries and field   application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However,   biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields,   registration is not required).




Vegetative stage




 


Common cultural practices: 

Deep summer ploughing between rows
Timely irrigation 
Avoid water logging 
Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding   chemical spray, when 1- 2 larval parasitoids are observed 

Common mechanical practices: 

Remove and destroy alternate wild hosts and   weeds
Remove and destroy the dead hearts along with   larvae
Installation of light trap @ 1/ acre
Prune and burn all attacked shoot and   branches.

Common biological practices: 

Conserve natural enemies through ecological   engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies





Nutrients



Apply fertilizers according to the age of   plant @ 20 g N + 15 g P + 15 g K per plant in first year and doubling the   dose each year till a stabilised dose is reached at 6th years. 
Apply manures @ 50kg per plant in Dec -   January every year along with full dose of P and K. 
The fertilizers should be applied in 20-30 cm   deep and 30cms wide trench along the drip line of the tree.





Weeds



Intercultural operations between the rows.
Tool weeding should be done on regular basis   especially around the plants. Use slashing and moving between the rows to   control the weeds.





Defoliating beetles



Use of plastic-lined trenches, propane flamers   and vacuums.





Hairy caterpillar


Cultural control: 

Irrigate once to avoid prolonged mid -season   drought. 

Mechanical control: 

Dig the pits of 1 inch depth between the   fields &amp; dust to kill the larvae in pits.





Leaf curl plum aphid


Cultural control: 

In the early stages, wash away any aphids with   a sharp spray from a hose pipe
Put on a pair of gloves and crush them between   your fingers.

 Chemical control: 

Spray dimethoate 30% EC@ 594-792 ml diluted in   600-800 lit of water. 

Biological control: 

Conserve predators such as lacewing and   ladybird beetle. 
Companion Planting - Plant yellow/orange   nasturtium around the base of fruit trees to attract aphids and lure them   away, or alternatively repel aphids by planting strong smelling herbs such as   chives, garlic, marigold, and tansy under the trees. 





Brown apricot scale


Biological control: 

Conserve parasites such as Coccophagus,   Encyrtus, and Metaphycus spp. Parasitized nymphs are almost black and have   convex covers; unparasitized nymphs are flat. 





San Jose scale


Cultural control:

Grow attractant plants for natural enemies:   viz., sunflower family, carrot family plants, buckwheat 

Mechanical control: 

See the common mechanical control 

Biological control: 

Parasitoids such as Encarsia perniciosi and   Aphytis diaspidis cause effective parasitization. 
Coccinellid predators such as Chilocorus   infernalis, Chilocorus rubidus, Pharoscymnus flexibilis 





Tent Caterpillar


Mechanical control:

Egg mass covered with yellowish hair collect   and destroy (between August-March). 
Put a burlap at the base of tree trunk to destroy the larvae underneath the   burlap 





Leaf roller


Cultural control: 

Delayed dormant treatments and bloom time   applications helps keep leaf roller populations under control. 
Regular monitoring each season is important so   that prompt action can be taken. Biological control 
Conserve parasites such as Macrocentrus,   Apanteles and Exochus attack leaf roller larvae. 
Conserve predators such as lacewings, assassin   bugs, and minute pirate bugs. 





Earwig


Cultural control: 

Remove all pruning debris and loose bark   around trees. 
Wrapping trunks tightly with plastic wrap 





Green capsid


Mechanical control: 

Grow rootstock sucker, especially at the edges   of orchards where the pest is removed. 





Consperse sting bug



See common cultural and mechanical practices 





Cow rhinoceros beetle


Cultural control: 

Monitor parasite levels through the use of   faecal egg counts to determine. 
Determine thresholds for parasites such as   buffalo fly and do not treat until these levels are reached. This will target   treatment times and decrease treatments. 
Regularly reassess parasite thresholds in   light of changing seasonal variations. 
Genetic selection of animals resistant or   resilient to parasites. 

Mechanical control: 

Use “off animal” chemical attractants and   baits. 
The use of traps. 
Vaccines. 





Blossom thrips


Cultural control: 

See common cultural practices. 

Biological control: 

Conserve coccinellids, anthocorids, lygaeid,   predatory thrips etc. for controlling blossom thrips 





Frosty mildew


Cultural control: 

Spraying at full bloom needs to be avoided. 
Alkathene bands cleaned at regular interval 

Mechanical control: 

Prune diseased leaves and malformed panicles   harbouring the pathogen to reduce primary inoculum load. 





Brown rot


Cultural control: 

Fruiting bodies of the pathogen should be   removed and destroyed 

Biological control:

Application of Trichoderma spp. and   Pseudomonas fluorescence. 





Shot hole



Buds can be protected from shot hole during   the dormant season (mid-November to mid-December) by a fungicide application   before the long winter rains begin. 





Powdery mildew


Cultural control: 

Spraying at full bloom needs to be avoided.
Alkathene bands cleaned at regular interval

Mechanical control: 

Prune diseased leaves and malformed panicles   harbouring the pathogen to reduce primary inoculum load. 





Silver canker



Pruning is carried out during periods of dry   weather between harvest and leaf fall.  
Before pruning it is good orchard practice to   clean up any dead wood which may be lying around the orchard environment. 





White root rot



White root rot infected plants removed and   destroyed. All roots, litter and debris from infected plants must also be   removed and destroyed. 
Creating a trench with a shovel around   infected areas prevent water runoff from distributing the fungal pathogen to   nearby plants. 
Preparing the soil before planting with soil   solarisation 





Collar rot


Cultural control: 

Pruning diseased wood, removing fruit mummies,   light penetration and air circulation, and avoiding poor sites. 
Good soil drainage and more frequent but   shorter irrigations reduce root and crown rot. 

Biological control 

Use of biopesticides like Trichoderma spp.,   Pseudomonas fluorescence,





Gummosis


Cultural control: 

The disease transmitting ring nematodes should   be controlled and maintaining healthy, vigorous trees. 
Lighter, more frequent irrigation with drip or   micro sprinklers, improved tree nutrition [nitrogen], etc.) will help reduce   the incidence of this disease. 
Heavy tree pruning during the dormant period   should be prevented. 
Sandy soils and in some heavy soils, control   has been achieved with pre-plant fumigation for ring nematodes.





Flowering stage




Nutrients



Nitrogen is applied in 2 splits, first half at   2-3 weeks before flowering and the remaining half a month later. 
The fertilizers should be applied in 20-30 cm   deep and 30cms wide trench along the drip line of the tree.





Weeds



Intercultural operations to check the weed   growth. 
Same as in vegetative stage.





Flat headed borer



Wrap or paint the tree trunk above and 1 inch   below the soil line with white, water-based paint or whitewash to protect the   trunk from sunburn and flat headed borer invasions. 
Prune infested wood and burn or remove it from   the orchard





Hairy caterpillar, Leaf curl plum aphid, Brown apricot scale, San   jose scale and Tent caterpillar


Same as mentioned in the above vegetative stage




Codling moth


Cultural control:

Use synthetic codlemone for mating disruption   at a height of 6- 8 feet or Dispensers should be deployed within 1 meter of   the top of the canopy prior to spring emergence during late may to 3 rd week   of July. . 

Biological control:

Conserve coccinellids, anthocorids, lygaeid,   etc. for controlling codling moth. 
Release Trichogramma spp





Peach twig borer


Mechanical control: 

·   Mating disruption is most effective in orchards with low moth populations   that are not close (a mile) to other untreated peach twig borer hosts or   almond orchards. 

 Biological control: 

Conserve natural enemies such as gray field   ant, Formica aerata, 





Consperse sting bug, Cow rhinocerus beetle and Blossom Thrips


Same as mentioned in the above vegetative stage 




Brown rot, Frosty mildew, Powdery mildew, Silver canker, White root   rot, Collar rot and Bacterial Gummosis


Same as mentioned in the above vegetative stage 




Fruiting stage




Nutrient Management



For mature trees, a mixture of 40 kg farmyard   manure, 500g N, 250 g P2O5 and 200 g K is recommended. The farmyard manure   should be applied during December-January along with full dose of P and K. Nitrogen is applied in 2 parts, first half at 2-3 weeks before flowering and the remaining half a month later.
The band application of nitrogenous   fertilizers should be preferred over broadcasting. 
Under rainfed conditions, apply N through 1 or 2 foliar sprays of urea (0.5%) after fruit set. 
Apply recommended micronutrients, if symptoms   are observed. Fruits are deformed under boron deficiency. 
To avoid boron deficiency, apply H2BO3 (0.1%) as foliar spray. 





Weed Management



Remove weeds around the plants. 
Use straw or black polyethylene Mulch to avoid   weed growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period. 
Mulching tree basins with 10-15 cm thick dry   grass also checks weed growth. 





Flat headed borer, Hairy caterpillar, San jose scale, Tent   caterpillar and Codling moth


Same as mentioned in the above maturity stage 




Peach twig borer and Dung beetle


Same as mentioned in the above maturity stage 




Brown rot, Frosty mildew, Powdery mildewm Silver canker, Collar rot   and Bacterial Gummosis


Same as mentioned in the above maturity stage 




Whisker rot


Mechanical control: 

Preventing skin cuts and punctures during   harvest and packing is of prime importance in controlling rhizopus rot. 
Clean containers and good housekeeping in the   packing shed and storage reduce the rot.
Store fruit at or below 39°F—the fungus does   not grow at temperatures below 40°F. 





Note: The pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on high volume spray.
