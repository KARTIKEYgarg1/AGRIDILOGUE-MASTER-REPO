Coconut


Soil

Red, Sandy loam, Red Sandy loam Soils are good. In flood prone area and low lying area having      water  stagnation  problem,  generally  coconut  is   not  recommended.  Almost  in  all  types  of  soil,       coconut can be grown.

Variety

Assam  Tall,  Kamrupa  cultivars  are  best  suited   for  Assam.  Hybrids  like,  D.X.T.,  TXD  may  be       planted for commercial cultivation. Dwarf variety of coconuts are planted in front of the house for      ornamental    purposes.

Selection of Mother Palm

The mother palm should be free from any pest & disease. Palm should have a minimum of 30 fully      opened leaves. Age of the palm should be above 20 years and should produce more than 100 nuts/      palm in a year regularly.

Selection of Seed coconut


Coconuts may be harvested from October to January for seed purpose. 
Twelve months old fully matured coconuts may be harvested for better germination.
The seednuts should be of medium size, round/oblong shape.

Selection of coconut seedling


Seedlings should be of 9 to 12 months old.
Seedlings should have 6-7 green leaves  and caller girth may be of 10 cm dia.
Early splitted leaves of seedlings indicate early production. 

Planting

Time of planting at Main field - Planting  may  be  done  from  April,  May  to  Sept,  October  according  to  the  land  condition.  Early       planted seedlings get established during monsoon period.

Spacing - In square system, planting distance should be 8mx8m. 156 seedlings can be planted in 1 ha. area      i.e.  21  plants  can  be  accommodated  in  a  bigha  of  land.  Higher  spacing  is  always  better  for  inter/         mixed    cropping.

Size of the pit - Size of the pit may be of 1mx1mx1m. In hard soil, size can be increased to 1.2mx1.2mx1.2m.

Pit Mixtures and filling of pits - This can be made by mixing top soil, 500g Rock Phosphate/ S.S.P. 50 kg dry cowdung/compost,      100g  10%  sevidol. In hard soil, 1 kg      salt  may  be  given  at  the  bottom  of  the  pit  for  loosening  the  soil.  After  planting  a  bund  may  be       made around the pit for preventing run off water.

Fertilizer Application

In order to increase the production and productivity of coconuts organic and inorganic fertilizers  need to be applied every year. The quantity of fertilizers to be applied for each palm per year are        given      below

50  kg  dry  cowdung  compost,  green  leaves  and  50  gram.  Borax  per  palm/year  along  with  above   mentioned  fertilizers  should  be  applied  around  the  palm  in  circular  basin  of  1.8m.  radius  with   30cm  and  25cm.  depth  and  irrigated  for  proper  absorption.  The  basins  may  be  filled  up  after         application      of      fertilizers.

Irrigation

Irrigation can increase 30 to 40% production of  coconuts, hence coconuts should be irrigated 150  to 200 liters of water per palm once in four days. It should be given around the coconut basin of  2m.  radius  during  dry  period  from  November  to   February  for  getting  higher  production.  The   coconut  basin  should  be  mulched  with  dried  lives,  coconut  husks  and  other  organic  wastes  for   moisture conservation and increasing  soil fertility and production of coconuts.

Prevention of diseases

In case of bud rot affected palm the affected portion of the crown should be removed and apply  Bordeaux  paste/  Bliton  paste  and  protect  it  from  rain  by  providing  a  polythene  covering.  If  the         palm  is  affected  by  Ganoderma  disease,  10ml.  calixin  mixed  with  100  ml  water  kept  in  a   polythene bag may be applied through root feeding. 5 kg neem cake or 100 kg compost may be  applied  to  affected  palm.  100  gm  Borax  may  be  applied  around  the  palm  basin  in  the  crown   choking affected palm and repeated after three months.
