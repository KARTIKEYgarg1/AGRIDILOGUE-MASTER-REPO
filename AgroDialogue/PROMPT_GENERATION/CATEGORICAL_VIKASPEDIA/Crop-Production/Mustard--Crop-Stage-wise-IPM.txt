Mustard: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre planting*



Nutrients
• Apply FYM @ 4.0 t/acre or   vermicompost @ 2.0 t/acre. • Incorporation of mustard residue (1 t/acre) + Sesbania green manuring   enhances the mustard yield in the long run. • Seed treatment should be done with Azotobactor culture @ 240 g/acre.


Weeds
Cultural control • Deep ploughing during summer • At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to   minimize the weeds menace in field. • In stale seed bed technique field is irrigated prior to sowing and weed   seeds are allowed to germinate. Then the weed seedlings are turned into soil   by ploughing before sowing.


Defoliators/soil borne   pathogens
Cultural control: • Deep ploughing to expose the soil borne pathogens and hibernating stage   of defoliators. • Prepare the level and well drained field to reduce the incidence of   Sclerotinia rot. • Destruction of plant debris • For club rot management, soil amendment with lime (@ 1 Kg/m2) to raise soil pH to   7.2 or apply Neem cake @ 0.5 Kg/m2 



Sowing/seedling*



Nutrients
• Basal application of NPK is   done on soil test basis. Generally, 32 Kg N, 16 Kg P and 16 Kg K per acre is   required by mustard crop. • Half of the N dose should be applied at the time of sowing. • Basal application of 16 Kg Sulphur /acre is also recommended for   mustard. • Under alkaline conditions, S should be applied through Gypsum


Weeds
Cultural control: • Adopt crop rotation, if there is infestation of Orobanche in previous   season, pulse crop should be sown in place of mustard in that field. • Early sowing in line with weed free certified seeds. • Adopt recommended agronomic practices with respect to row spacing, plant   spacing, fertilizers application, water management etc. to obtain the healthy   plant stand. • Adopt intercropping with wheat/pulses/ sugarcane. Chemical control: • Apply oxadiargyl 6% EC @ 600 ml in 200 l of water/acre 0-3 days after   sowing. As pre-emergence herbicide followed by one hand weeding at 30 days   after planting, if required


Aphids
Cultural control: • Early sowing to avoid damage due to mustard-aphid, and major   diseases. • Use tolerant varieties. • Early planting to escape the damage. • Use yellow sticky traps. Mechanical control: • Destroy the affected part along with aphid population in the initial   stage. Biological control: • 2 per cent Neem oil and 5 per cent Neem Seed Kernel Extract (NSKE)   effective against the mustard aphid • Ladybird beetles viz., Coccinella septempunctata, Menochilus sexmaculata,   Hippodamia variegata and Cheilomones vicina are most eff cient pradators of   the mustard aphid. Adult beetle may feed an average of 10 to 15 adults/   day. • Several species of syrphid /hover fly ie., Sphaerophoria sp.,   Eristallis sp., Metasyrphis sp., Xanthogramma sp and Syrphus spp. • The braconid parasitoid, Diaeretiella rapae. • The lacewing, Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi. • Predatory bird Motacilla cospica. • A number of entomogenous fungi, Cephalosporium spp., Entomophthora and   Verticillium lecanii infect aphids 



Chemical control: • Chlorpyrifos 20 % EC @ 200 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Dimethoate 30% EC @ 264 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Malathion 50% EC @ 400 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Methylparathion 2% DP @ 6000 g/acre • Monocrotophos 36% SL @150 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Oxydemeton–methyl 25% EC @ 400 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Phorate 10% CG @ 4000 g/acre • Phosphamidon 40% SL @ 200 ml in 200 l of water/acre • Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 20-40 g in 200-400 l of water/acre


Painted bug
Cultural control: • Deep ploughing the soil to destroy eggs of painted bug. • Early sowing is needed to avoid pest attack. • Irrigate the crop in IV week after sowing to reduce pest attack. • Quick threshing of the harvested crop should be done. Mechanical control: • Burn the remains of mustard crop so that the stages of insect do not   reach the next year crop. • The bugs usually congregate on the leaves and stem which can be jerked to   dislodge them and killed in kerosene water Biological control: • Conserve bio-control agents such as Alophora spp. (tachinid fl y)   parasitizing eggs of painted bugs. Chemical control: • Dichlorvos76% EC @ 250.8 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Imidacloprid 70% WS @ 700 g/100 Kg seed • Phorate 10% CG @ 6000 g/acre


Mustard saw fly
Cultural control: • Summer ploughing to destroy the pupae. • Early sowing should be done. • Maintain clean cultivation. • Apply irrigation in seedling stage for saw fly management because most of   the larvae die due to drowning effect. Mechanical control: • Collection and destruction of larvae of saw fly in morning and   evening. Biological control: • Conserve Perilissus cingulator (parasitoids of the larvae), and the   bacterium Serratia marcescens which infect the larvae of saw fly. • Use of bitter gourd seed oil emulsion as on anti- feedant Chemical control: • Dimethoate 30% EC@264 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Quinalphos2 5% EC @ 480 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Imidacloprid 70% WS @ 700 g/100 Kg seeds • Malathion EC 50% EC @ 600 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • Methylparathion 2% DP@ 6000 g/acre


Bihar hairy caterpillar**
Cultural control: • Pre-monsoon deep ploughing (two/three times) will expose the hibernating   pupae to sunlight and predatory birds. • Removal and destruction of alternate wild hosts which harbour the hairy   caterpillars. Mechanical control: • Collection and destruction of egg masses and the gregarious stages of   early instar larvae twice a week. Biological control: • Conserve the natural bio control population of spiders, long horned   grasshoppers, praying mantid, robber fly, ants, green lace wing, damsel   flies/dragon fly, flower bugs, shield bugs, lady bird beetles, ground beetle,   predatory cricket, earwig, braconids, trichogrammatids, green muscardine   fungus.
