ICAR Rabi season Agro Advisory for Lakshadweep Islands

Generic Advisory

Predominantly the islanders grow vegetables/fruits during this period. The pre-rabi advisory for farmers is to prepare land for vegetables and fruit cultivation. Farmers ready for cultivation of vegetable and fruits have to be think about conservation of available water. Conserve water in surface and sub-surface horizons of soil which in turn address drought related issues in coconut and other crops grown in the island. Use natural mulching (locally available farm materials) for conversation of moisture.

Homestead gardens


Drought management in homesteads should be undertaken through husk burial in trenches, mulch with dried coconut leaves, sow cowpea or green manure crops on receipt of NE- monsoon showers in coconut basins.
Manage the microclimate with intercrops like tubers, vegetables, perennial vegetables, medicinal plants, spices, and banana to make each homestead as nutritional garden.

Vegetables


Planting material production of vegetables can be initiated. Use grow bag, soil less medium and organic inputs for vegetable cultivation. Use drip or wick irrigation sources for assuring wetness for better growth of plants. Use soil less medium @ 5kg/bag.
Farmers interested in vegetable cultivation can start seedling production through nursery method. Farmers should use good quality seeds in warm and protected place by using seedling trays or seed beds with fertile soil enriched with FYM or compost.
Seeds should be treated with pseudomonas florescence (10g/Kg).
To control Root Knot Nematode, apply Pochonia chlamydosporia 10g/l and apply apply Neemcake 1kg Per Plant. Similarly, to control Powdery mildew, spray Bordeaux mixture 1% in the affected areas. To control fruit rot soil drenching with Tricoderma 10 g/l can be performed. 

Coconut


Farmers need to provide staking to young coconut seedlings as protection from heavy winds. The green manure crops should be ploughed in and incorporated into the soil during August-September.
To conserve moisture farmers are advised to use natural mulching materials near the coconut basin like green or dry leaves at the close during the onset of northeast monsoon. Farmers are advised to collect all the bio wastes of the farm and compost it for manure.
Sanitize the field to control Rhinoceros beetle, Crown cleaning and Fill crown with sand 250g +4 naphthalene ball can be administered and effectively hook out the beetle using beetle hook. For preventing and controlling bud rot sanitize the field clean the Crown cleaning and drench with Bordeaux mixture.

Banana


Take care of newly planted banana with organic manure (10kg/ plant). Irrigate twice a week, provide shade, and mulch using dried leaves.
Be vigilant about rhizome weevil. Apply neem-garlic emulsion to control the vectors spreading Bunchy top virus. Spray neem oil and garlic emulsion @6ml/litre on the lower leaf surface to control mites.
Provide stake to banana plant or protection from heavy winds. It is advised that farmers have to sanitize the field and perform the weeding periodically. Use the dried banana leaves for Mulching.
To prevent Rizhome rot use healthy planting materials, remove the outer layer of rhizome then soak in cow dung slurry and shade dry after the use of this panting material, soil drenching with Bordeaux mixture 1%, field sanitation and avoid water logging.
To prevent Rhizome Weevils and Pseudo stem weevil use healthy planting materials. Remove the outer layer of rhizome then soak in cow dung slurry and shade dry after the use of this panting material.

Livestock


Animal growers are advised to avoid water logging near livestock farms including poultry sheds.
For livestock keep the hooves away from water to avoid hoof rotting disease.
It is advised to take measures to reduce the tick and flies’ problem. It is always to be kept in mind that the farm area must be disinfected using disinfectants regularly.
All animal growers should make sure that the feed is stored in a dry place.
Vaccinate animals against foot &amp; mouth disease and haemorrhagic septicaemia
If fever, shivering, brown coloured urine, off feed etc. are noticed, consult veterinary doctor immediately

Fisheries


Fishermen sailing for fishing in boats must adhere COVID guidelines. All fishermen involved in fishing should have been vaccinated.
Use of mask and sanitizer during all operations is essential.
Fishing time should be based on information provided by the UT administration. Fishermen involved in fishing in groups must undergo COVID test as per the UT administration.
Time for marketing should be based on the information provided by UT administration (3-5 pm) if any changes may be adhered. Above all, the fishermen are advised to sell fish at doorsteps.
Efficient indigenous fishing techniques have been developed to catch different fishery resources in the lagoon as well as the open ocean waters.
Cage fish culture farmers may reduce standing stock by selling harvestable fish directly to consumers by keeping the COVID-19 protocol.
Fishermen must adhere to the uniform ban on fishing vessels in Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) beyond territorial water in the east and west side as per the period in Lakshadweep from 1st June to 31st July (61days) for conservation and effective management of fishery resources and for sea safety reasons.
