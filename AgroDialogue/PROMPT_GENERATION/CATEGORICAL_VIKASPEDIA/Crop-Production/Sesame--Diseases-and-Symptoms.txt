Sesame: Diseases and Symptoms


Phyllody

Disease symptoms

All floral parts are transformed into green leafy structures followed by abundant vein clearing in different flower parts.
In severe infection, the entire inflorescences is replaced by short twisted leaves closely arranged on a stem with short internodes, abundant abnormal branches bend down.
Finally, plants look like witches broom.
If capsules are formed on lower portion of plant they do not yield quality seeds

Transmission and favourable conditions

The disease is transmitted through jassids and the phytoplasma survives in leaf hopper throughout its life.

Dry root rot

Disease symptoms

The fungus attacks young seedling, their stems become water soaked soft and incapable of supporting the seedling which falls over and dies.
On older seedlings elongated brownish black lesions appear which increase in length and width girdling the stem and plant dies.

Survival and spread - The pathogen survives in seed and soil.

Favourable conditions - High soil temperatures and moisture stress conditions favour the development of the pathogen.



Phytophthora blight

Disease symptoms
Disease can occur at all stages of the plant.


Initial symptom is water soaked spots on leaves and stems.
The spots are chestnut brown in the beginning later turn to black.
Premature leaf fall occurs.
In humid weather, severity of disease increases, main root is affected, diseased plants are easily pulled out and produce shriveled seeds and gives blighted appearance.

Survival and spread

The pathogen survives in soil

Favourable conditions

High soil moisture favours the development of the pathogen.
The disease is severe in the area of heavy soil with high rainfall

Alternaria blight

Disease symptoms:

The pathogen attacks all parts of the plant at all stages.
Small, dark brown water soaked, round to irregular lesions, with concentric rings, 1-8 mm in diameter appear on the leaves and under excessive atmospheric and soil humidity the spot increases in size and number.
The lesions may also appear on the midrib and veins of the leaves.
Milder attacks cause only defoliation, in severe cases the plant may die.

Transmission and favourable conditions

The pathogen is seed borne.
Temperature of 20-30o C and high humid conditions favour the disease.
