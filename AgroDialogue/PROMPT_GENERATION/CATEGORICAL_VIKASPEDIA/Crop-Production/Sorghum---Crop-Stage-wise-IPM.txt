Sorghum : Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre-sowing*




Common cultural practices: · Deep summer ploughing · Use resistant/tolerant varieties · Follow crop rotation with non-host crops · Destroy the alternate host plants · Sow the ecological engineering plants · Sow sorghum/maize/bajra in 4 rows all around the main crop as   guard/barrier crop · Soil solarization to prevent soil borne pathogens. · Timely sowing should be done. · Field sanitation, rogueing · Destroy the alternate host plants · Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations · Adoption of crop rotation Common mechanical practices: · Uproot and burn infected plants parts early to avoid spread of the   disease. · Collection and destruction of larvae.


Nutrients
· Apply FYM @ 5 t/ acre and incorporate in the soil 2 to 3 weeks before   sowing.


Weeds
· Remove existing weeds at the   time of sowing. · Weed species: Cyperus iria, Digera arvensis, Convolvulus arvensis,   Trianthema sp.,Tridax procumbens, Euphorbia hirta, Phyllanthus niruri are   controlled by 2,4-D dimethyl amine salt 58% SL 612 ml in 200-240 l of   water/acre and 2,4-D ethyl ester 38 % EC (having 2,4-D acid 34 % w/w) 400 ml   in 170 l of water/acre.


Soil   borne pathogens, resting stages of insects
Cultural control: · Effective weed control. · Trimming of bunds · Early planting minimizes shoot fly, midge and ear head bug damage. · Planting sunhemp as trap crop to control the pest. Biological control: · Application of neem cake@ 80 Kg/ acre for nematode control. · Controlling adult beetles feeding on neem. · Acacia like trees on field bunds by shaking trees and destroying the   beetles.


Sorghum   loose Smut**
Cultural control: · Collect smutted ear-heads in cloth bags and destroy by dipping in boiling   water or bury in soil. · Avoid ratooning. Chemical control: · Spray thiram 75% WS @ 10-12 g/acre in 400 ml of water.


Grain   smut**
Cultural control: · Collect smutted ear-heads in cloth bags and destroy by dipping in boiling   water. · Avoid ratooning Chemical control: · Seed treatment with sulphur 80% WP 1.2-1.6g/Kg seed in 400 ml of water.



Sowing*




Common cultural practices: · Use healthy, certified and weed free seeds. · Follow proper spacing · Crop rotation with pulses or oilseed crops. Common mechanical practices: · After harvest, plough to remove and destroy the stubbles. · Collection and destruction of white grub.


Nutrients
· Apply NPK fertilizers as per   soil test recommendations as far as possible. If soil test recommendations   are not available, adopt a blanket recommendation of 30 N, 18 P2O5, and 18   K2Kg/acre. · Application of bio-fertilizers: When Azospirillum is used apply only 75%   of recommended N for irrigated sorghum. · Mix 12.5 Kg of micronutrient mixture formulated with enough sand to make   a total quantity of 50 Kg. · Basal application of 10 Kg ZnSO4/acre-1 for the deficient soils or 5 Kg Zn SO4 acre -1 + FYM for the   Zn deficient soils · Basal application of FeSO4, 20 Kg/acre along with 5 t/acre FYM for iron deficient soils.

Shoot   fly
Cultural control: · Early sowing to avoid the active period of shoot fly population. · Planting date in kharif 7-10 days onset of monsoon and in rabi end of   September to 1st week of October is ideal to escape the shoot fly · High seed rate 1.6 – 2.0 Kg/acre. · Tall variety with yellow glossy stem less attacked.
