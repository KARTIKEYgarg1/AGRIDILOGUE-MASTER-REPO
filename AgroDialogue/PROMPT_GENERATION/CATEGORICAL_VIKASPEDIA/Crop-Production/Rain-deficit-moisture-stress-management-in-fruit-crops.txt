Rain deficit moisture stress management in fruit crops


Mango


During establishment stage of mango in the field, sub-soil irrigation through pitcher buried 10 cm from the plant, 1 foot below ground level, covered by a plastic plate and fed  through a 3 cm diameter pipe with 1.25 liters of water  applied/plant/day and mulched with sugarcane thrash mulch (1.0 kg/basin) results in better establishment.
Black polyethylene film (100 micro thick) helps in conservation of moisture and increase in root growth, flowering, fruiting and minimum fruit drop with enhancement in yield.
Rain water harvesting through opening of circular trenches around trees at a distance of 6 feet and width at 9 inches, as well as depth and mulching the trenches with dry mango leaves, helps in retaining sufficient moisture in the soil during flowering and fruiting and increase in yield.
Drip irrigation along with crop residue mulch helps in water saving. Drip irrigation with 0.6 volumes of water and plastic mulch significantly increases the yield. The water stress immediately after fruit set increases fruit drop in mango. Hence, protective irrigation is essential during the fruit development period.
Due to high temperature stress in many areas leaf fall is observed. To overcome the leaf fall and to enhance the turgidity spray 0.2 % cent Potassium Sulphate.

Monsoon is delayed by 15 days :  - No adverse impact as fruits are already matured in early  and  mid  season  varieties  ;  fruit  size  and  quality  will  be  affected  in  late  maturing  varieties viz., Chausa, Mallika and Amrapali. But irrigation and mulching is required to be followed. .

Monsoon is delayed by 30 days : No adverse impact as  fruits are already matured in early and mid season varieties ; incidence of shoulder browning (fruit blemishes , tear stain ) and post-harvest diseases will be minimum ; fruit quality will be good; fruit size and quality will be  affected  in  late  maturing  varieties like,  Chausa,  Mallika  and  Amrapali  etc., ; impact severity will   increase.   Further   increased   temperature,  relative   humidity   during   July-September will lead to telescoped harvests, market gluts , increased incidence of jelly seed formation (internal breakdown of pulp matrix ) following rainfall. irrigation and mulching.

Rainfall deficit  at  vegetative  phase : Impacts adversely the production of  vegetative shoots (potential  fruiting  wood of the ensuing season). But irrigation and mulching is required to be followed.

Rainfall deficit  at  reproductive  stage:  Favourable during fruit bud differentiation (FBD) stage. But irrigation and mulching is required to be followed.

Terminal  drought  : Crop prospects of ensuing season will be affected especially in light soils ; recurrent  droughts lead to crop failure. But irrigation and mulching is required to be followed.

Banana


The soil moisture deficit stress in banana during vegetative stage causes poor bunch formation, lower number and small sized fingers. The water stress during flowering causes poor filling of fingers and unmarketable bunches and reduced bunch weight and other growth parameters. 
Providing  irrigation  through  drip  helps  in  reducing  the  adverse  effects  of  water stress.
Plant Protection Measures - High   temperatures   along   with   low   humidity   are congenial  for  flare  up  of  sucking  pests  like  thrips  and  mites  in  fruit  crops  viz., mango,   grapes,   and   pomegranate.   Proper   monitoring   and   timely   spraying   of recommend  pesticides   will  bring  down   the   severity  of  incidence.    For  thrips, insecticides  like  thiamethoxam  25WG@  0.25  g/L  or  Acephate  75SP  @1.5  g/l  or spinosad  45  %  SC  @  0.5  ml/l  will  bring  down  the  thrips  infestation.    For  mite management, dicofol 18.5 EC @ 2.5 ml/l or fenpyroximate 5SC @ 0.5 ml/l. 

If monsoon is delayed by 15 days/ 30 days :


In most of the banana growing areas, usually planting of suckers / tissue culture plants should be taken up after the on-set of monsoon.
Since banana crop is not monsoon dependent, planting can be done according to the on-set of monsoon.

Rain deficit at vegetative and reproductive phase : 


In the scenario of rain fall deficit during the vegetative stage, farmers are advised to go for drip irrigation to conserve the water and also to provide the required water at root-zone to increase the water use efficiency
As   a   mitigation   measure,   0.1mM   salicylic   acid   (140   mg/litre   of   water   with surfactant) foliar spray can be given to the plant @ 250 ml/plant
Foliar    application    of    Kaolinite    (5%)    during    vegetative    state    reduces    the transpiration water loss.
Foliar  fertilization with five sprays  of  3%  Polyfeed  (19:19:19),  i.e., 30g  litre-1 of water along   with  surfactant at 15 days interval during vegetative stage is recommended.
Mulching of the soil surface either with  black polythene or with plant material / leaves of banana etc. can be spread around the basin to reduce the water loss.
Growing green manure crops around the plant and mulching is recommended.
Application  of  5kg  Rice  husk  ash or  composted  coir  pith  in  the  pit  at the  time  of planting is recommended to increase the water holding capacity in the rhizosphere.
Instead of open irrigation, sub-surface irrigation is recommended.

Terminal drought : In the case of terminal drought, growing of banana with sub-surface irrigation, plastic mulching, mitigation with salicylic acid, foliar spray of water soluble fertilizer and leaves retaining with 5-6 leaves is recommended to help in overcome the drought situation.

Pomegranate

If monsoon is delayed by 15 or 30 days and rain deficit at vegetative phase:


Crop residue recycling to build organic carbon reserves to improve soil health and water holding capacity to cope with dry spells
In-situ moisture conservation using organic or inorganic mulches should be practiced with immediate effect. Locally available organic plant wastes or plastic mulches (white/black/ pervious mulches)
Avoid applying fertilizer till sufficient soil moisture is available  or fertigation may be adopted for efficient use of limited available/harvested rainwater.
Reduce intercultural operations to minimize the loss of moisture
Removing suckers and water sprouts
Conserve the stored water in ponds and earmarking for use of life saving irrigation in critical stages of the crops.
Make raised ridges along the rows around the plants.
Apply Hydrogel in the root zone of the plant below drippers. Mix 500g hydrogel in 5 Kg  fine sand/soil; apply 20 g of this mixture/tree
Take sprays of abamectin 1.95 EC @0.5ml/l if mite infestation is seen due dry conditions

Rain deficit at reproductive phase:


Spray Gibberelic  acid (GA) 10mg/l+ 0.5ml/l spreader sticker at full bloom
Spray boric acid 2g/l + 0.5ml/l spreader sticker within 20 days of fruit set in the evening. Repeat after 1 month.
Next day spray N-(2-chloro-4-pyridinyl) phenyl urea(CPPU)  [common name for chlorfenuron] @5ml/l +0.5ml/l.

Terminal drought: In addition to the measures mentioned above the number of fruits should be reduced depending on assured water available with the farmer. Sprays of  2,4-Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) 10mg/l in plants below 4 years repeat after 10 days if required may be taken in case of fruit dropping. In plants above 4 years 1 spray of 20mg/l may be sprayed.

Litchi


Litchi being an evergreen plant, the maintenance of optimum soil moisture is critical for growth, development and fruit production. 
It  is  adapted  to  warm  subtropics,  cropping  best  in  region  with  brief  dry  frost  free winters and long, hot summers with high rainfall and humidity. 
If  rainfall  is  evenly  distributed,  litchi  is  grown  successfully  and  supplementary  water requirement depends  upon cultivar and evaporation demand.
To achieve faster growth of the plant, no water stress should be permitted, while in the reproductive phase water stress is beneficial at the time of panicle emergence, flowering and fruit bud differentiation (February-March).
Light  irrigation  but  at  frequent  short  intervals  during  summer  months  and  cleaning  of the basin is advocated (April-May).
Certain physiological  disorders  like  poor  sex  ratio,  poor  fruit  set,  heavy  fruit  drop  and high fruit cracking and  sunburn of the fruit are more intense under water deficit in the rhizosphere and can be minimized with proper water management (March–May).
Early   flushing,   proper   vegetative   growth   and   shoot   development   are   very   much influenced  by  the  timely  onset  of  monsoon,  without any  additional  irrigation  (June-September).
Intercultural  operations,  pruning  and  training  operation  and  summer  ploughing  is followed just after harvesting of the fruits, dependent on cultivars (June -July).
Arrival   of   monsoon   brings,   great   change   in   weather   conditions,   immediately   the atmosphere becomes saturated with moisture and relative humidity goes high (&gt;90 %). It also marks disappearance of dry heat, scorching loo, winds and appearance of wet and cold  air,  thunderstorms,  cumulus  clouds  having  overhead,  which  give  a  good  boost  to vegetative growth of litchi.
The  phase  change  i.e.  vegetative  to  reproductive  stage  require  induction  of  cool/low  temperature with mild stress condition with restricted or no supplemental irrigation.
Fruit  development,    fruit  yield  and  quality    require  regular  monitoring  of  nutrients  and  moisture with good management practices during pre - monsoon period for economically  viable harvest. 

If monsoon is delayed by 15 days : 


New  litchi   fruit   plantations,  under  area   expansion   programme,  which  is   generally  associated with onset of monsoon, will be delayed. 
Cost of handling and maintenance of planting material will increase. 
In  case  of  early  varieties  (cvs.  Shahi,  Rose  Scented) cost  of  two  irrigations  will  increase  while  in  case  of  late  varieties  (cvs.  China,  Late  Bedana)  cost  of  at  least  one  number  of  irrigation will increase. 
The  adult  plant  of  litchi  (&gt;10  years),  which  is  supposed  to  be  drought  tolerant  and  can  survive  4 - 12  weeks  without  water  will  start  developing  its  adaptive  a biotic  stress  tolerance       mechanism       like              shading       of       leaves,       delay       in       flushing,  curving/dropping/bending of leaflets and will force the plant to go in resting phase with  restricted overall vegetative growth and vigour. 
Overall,    the    exhausted    commercial    bearing    litchi    plants/trees    need    immediate  application  of  nutrition  and  irrigation,  just  after  the  harvesting  of  fruits,  will  be  less  effective under the conditions of delayed monsoon. 
The  required  pruning  and  training  operations  followed  just  after  the  harvest  of  fruits,  which  cause  decrease  in  the  canopy  density,  needs  immediate  application  of  manures  and fertilizers for early emergence of new flushes will be affected and influence the next  season fruiting due to non or late emergence of current season shoots. 
In  case  of  delayed  monsoon,  atmospheric  humidity  remains  very  low  consequently,  evapo -transpiration  rises  considerably  during  this  period (June),  the  root  activity  and  nutrient  use  efficiency  are  badly  affected,  ultimately  affecting  the  overall  vegetative  growth and vigour of plant, ma y lead towards declining phase  and revival will take time  during that annual cycle. 

If monsoon is delayed by 30 days :


Area expansion programme by new litchi fruit plantations which is generally associated  with onset of  monsoon, will be delayed. 
Cost of handling and maintenance of planting material will increase. 
In case of early varieties cost of four numbers of  irrigation will increase while in case of  late  cost  of  two  numbers  of  irrigation  will  increase  to  maintain  th e  annual  growth  and  reproductive cycle of the fruiting trees. 
Delay  in  the  emergence  of  early  flushing  will  influence  the  vegetative  growth,    shoot  maturity, flowering and fruiting of the coming season. 
Shoot growth and  vegetative growth will be slow. 
Drying of newly emerged flushes and shoot tip burning may occur. 
The   adult   plants/trees   of   litchi   (&gt;10   years)   will   start   developing   stress   tolerant  mechanism  to  be  in  resting  phase  to  overcome  the  stress  condition  created  due  to  delayed monsoon and ultimately affecting the due vegetative growth of the season. 
Litchi  has  low  ability  to  transport  water  from  root  to  leaves  and  in  case  of  delayed   monsoon   and   lack   of   moisture   in   the   root   zone   may   seize   many  physiological  and  metabolic  processes  of  the  plant  body.  As  wet  soil  alone  with  applied irrigation cannot prevent the development of tree water stress. Rain deficit at vegetative phase : 
Establishment of new plantations will be a difficult feature.
During  critical  crop  growth  stages,  too  many  days  without  ra in  can  adversely  affect  the  proper  vegetative  growth,  may  lead  to  crop  failure  during  the  coming  season. 
Shoot growth and  canopy spread will be slow. 
Litchi   trees   may   undergo   the   process   to   develop   stress   tolerant   adaptive  mechanism  to  remain  in  resting phase  rather  than  to  go  for  normal  vegetative  growth  during  the  season  and  will  affect  the  health  and  fruit  production  of  the  crop. 
As  mentioned  above,  that  litchi  has  low  ability  to  transport  water  from  root  to  leaves, the proper management practices (application of organic manures, use of  mulching) with supplementary irrigation through efficient and effective methods  may reduce the ill effect of the situation created due to deficit rainfall.
The important factor i.e., a high rate of relative humidity (RH), which  favours fast  vegetative growth, is lacking in the situation of deficit rain during the vegetative  phase,  always  an  important  factor  can  be  managed  by  providing    an  adequate  supply of water through irrigation. 
On  the  whole,  litchi  appears  to  suffer  moisture  stress  on  hot,  dry,  windy  days of  low  RH,  require  timely  implementation  technologies  with  proper  management  practices. 

Rain deficit at reproductive stage : 


The  phase  change  i.e.  vegetative  to  reproductive  stage    is  very  crucial  for  litchi  fruit  production,  which  require  induction  of  cool/low  temperature  in  conjunction  with the  conditions   of   low   moisture   in   the   rhizosphere   as   well   as   low   humidity   in   the  atmosphere,  hence  deficit  rain  with  no  supplemental  irrigation  creating  mild  stress  condition is  beneficial  for  better  transformation  into  reproductive  stage  in  litchi  cultivation. 
The mature shoots developed form the early appeared flushes only undergo in resting  phase and bring floriferous condition with created mild stress condition during winter  season.
Practices  of  withholding  irrigation  two  months  prior  to  the  expected  time  of  panicle  emergence,  no  intercultural  operation,  no  pruning  and  training  operation,  mulching  beneath the canopy spread area etc. is recommended and had proved beneficial during  this initiation (period) of reproductive stage. 

Terminal drought : 


Drought is a major abiotic factor, which excessively limits growth and vigour of the litchi  plants/trees in general and limits fruit production.
In  case  of  litchi  production  system  in  India  the  critical  period  for  irrigation  is  from  the  end of March to the onset of monsoon i.e.June as that is the time when fruit development  and  vegetative   growth  occur,  drought  condition  may  be   managed  through  proper  irrigation management through various improved systems of irrigation. 
One of the major consequences of drought condition is inhibition of metabolic functions,  reduced  rate  of  photosynthesis  and  reduced  root  activity in  rhizosphere.  Consequently,  nutrient use efficiency is decreased, resulting decline in quantum of fruit production and  quality of fruits. 
From March onwards, when temperature starts rising in the places and the atmospheric   humidity remains very low consequently, evapo - transpiration rises considerably during  this  period and  if  the  litchi  orchard  is  not  frequently  irrigated  during  this  period,  there  may  be  occurrence  of  many  physiological  disorders  (fruit  cracking,  sunburn  and  fruit  drop). 
As mentioned that litchi has low ability to transport water from root to leaves, he nce, to  overcome  the  drought  condition,  proper  watering  of  the  orchard  to  the  level  till  it  regains  capacity  to  effectively  run  the  metabolic  processes  with reduced  cell  turgor  (as  visible from leaflets vigour),  management practices (application of organi c manures, use  of  mulching),  proper  pruning  and  training  operation  to  keep  the  reduced  height  of  the  trees  and  spreading  canopy  along  with  supplementary  nutrition  and  irrigation  through  improved and efficient methods,  may reduce the ill effect of the situ ation created due to  drought.
