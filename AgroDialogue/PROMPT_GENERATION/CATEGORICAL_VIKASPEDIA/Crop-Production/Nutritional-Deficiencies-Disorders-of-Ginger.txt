Nutritional Deficiencies/Disorders of Ginger


Nitrogen

Pale or yellow green leaves (chlorosis) symptoms appear first in the older leaves. Reddish tints gradually appear at the leaf margins spread toward the midrib or central vein. Leaves small in size. Overall growth is markedly reduced. Deficiency results in reduction of rhizome yield.

Correction measure: Foliar spray of urea 1% or DAP 2% twice at weekly interval.

Potassium

Since potassium is very mobile within the plant, symptoms only develop on young leaves in the case of extreme deficiency. Reduced growth, shortened internodes, marginal burn or scorch (brown leaf edges), necrotic (dead) spots in the leaf, reduction of lateral breaks and tendency to wilt readily

Correction measure: Application of K @ 3.7 Kg/acre in four splits (basal, 60, 90 and 120 DAP) or foliar spray of K2SO4 @ 1% at fortnightly interval.

Iron

The deficiency of iron shows up first in the young leaves of plants, which develop interveinal chlorosis and it progresses rapidly over the entire leaf. In severe cases, the leaves turn completely white.
