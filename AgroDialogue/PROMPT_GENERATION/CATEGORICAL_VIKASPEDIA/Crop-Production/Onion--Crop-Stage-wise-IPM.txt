Onion: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity


Pre-sowing *


Nutrients
• Before sowing, soil testing   should be done to find out the soil fertility status. Nutrient should be   provided as per soil test recommendations. • Add well rotten FYM @ 10 t/acre or vermi compost @ 4 t/acre. Incorporate   FYM at the time of field preparation at 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting.   Vermicompost should be incorporated one week before transplanting.


Weeds
• Deep ploughing during   summer. • At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique or soil   solarization to minimize the weeds menace in field. • The boundary &amp; bunds of the field should be free from weeds. • Keep the nursery weeds free by manual weeding. 


Soil   borne pathogens, nematodes, and resting stages of insects
Cultural control: • Deep ploughing of fields during summer to control juveniles and adults of   nematodes, and control the overwintering stages. • Soil solarization: Cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45   mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarisation which will   help in reducing the soil borne pests.


Damping off
Cultural control: • Avoid excessive watering • Use raised beds: More than 15 cm height is better for water   drainage


Sowing / planting*


Nutrients
• Biofertilizers: Seed/seedling   treatment with Azotobacter and PSB cultures @ 240 g each/acre seed/   seedling. • Apply NPK fertilizers @ 40: 20: 40 Kg/acre. Apply 1/3 of N, entire P and   60 % K as basal dose at the time of planting. • Based on soil test for micronutrient, the deficient micronutrient should   be applied in soil at sowing / transplanting.


Weeds
• In high weed infested fields,   apply approved herbicides as mentioned below; • Spray oxyflourfen 23.5% EC @ 170-340 ml in 200-300 l of water/ acre on   soil as pre-plant application or quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC @ 300-400 ml 150-180   l of water/acre 20 days after planting of onion seedlings followed by one   hand weeding if required.


Vegetative stage


Nutrients
• Apply 1/3 of N at 21days and   remaining 1/3 at 45 days after transplanting. • Apply remaining 40 % potash as top dressing in standing crop at 21 days   after transplanting. • Micronutrient application may be made after soil test.


Weeds
• The crop should be maintained   weed free initially for 30-45 days by following timely intercultural and hand   weeding if required.


Onion thrips
Cultural control: • Use resistant/tolerant varieties. • Practice field sanitation. • Avoid successive planting of garlic or other preferred/alternate host   such as cabbage, cotton, tomato, cucumber, melons, pumpkins, strawberries   etc. • Plant the new crop in upwind direction of already planted crop which help   in escaping infestation from old planting to some extent in the initial   stages. • Adjust the transplanting dates • Use of reflective plastic silver colour and aluminium painted black   mulches repel the thrips (seed crop) • Use of sprinkler irrigation reduces thrips population considerably   compared to drip and surface irrigation • Plant two rows of maize or inner row of wheat and outer row of maize   surrounding the onion plots as barrier crop (National Horticultural Mission   2012) Biological control: • Conserve parasitoids such as Ceranisus menes (nymph) etc. • Conserve predators such as syrphid fl ies, minute pirate bug/ anthocorid   bug (Blaptosthethus sp, Buchananiella whitei, Orius tantilus), praying   mantis, predatory thrips (Aeolothrips fasciatum), damselbug, lacewings,   coccinellids (Cheilomenes sexmaculata), spiders etc. Chemical control: • Spray dimethoate 30% EC @ 264 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or oxydemeton   methyl 25% EC @ 480 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or quinalphos 25% EC @ 480   ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or lambda cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 120 ml in 120-160   l of water/acre. • Use high pressure and volume for good coverage of the crop and direct the   nozzle at base of leaves • Add a spreader or sticker (0.05-1.0%) for retention and spread of spray   fluid on erect leaves of onion. • In seed crop, thrips should be controlled well before flowers open.
