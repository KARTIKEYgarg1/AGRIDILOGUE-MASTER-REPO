Cucurbitaceous Vegetable Diseases


Downy mildew

Host range


Musk melon, Sponge gourd and Bitter gourd etc.

Symptoms: 


Yellow, angular spots restricted by veins resembling mosaic mottling appear on upper surface of leaves
The corresponding lower surface of these spots shows a purplish downy growth in moist weather
The spots turn necrotic with age
The diseased leaves become yellow and fall down
Diseased plants get stunted and die
Fruits produced may not mature and have a poor taste

Survival and spread: 


Primary: Oospores in soil and sporangia from perennial collateral weed hosts in the vicinity
Secondary: Wind borne and rain splashed conidia (sporangia) or autonomous zoospores

Favourable conditions: 


Relative humidity &gt; 90%
High soil moisture
Frequent rains 



Powdery mildew

Host range: 


Pumpkins, bottle gourd, coccinia, cucumber, ridge gourd, Bitter gourd is less affected.

Symptoms: 


Whitish or dirty grey, powdery growth on foliage, stems and young growing parts
The superficial growth ultimately covers the entire leaf area
The diseased areas turn brown and dry leading to premature defoliation and death
Fruits remain underdeveloped and are deformed

Survival and spread: 


Primary: Dormant mycelium or cleistothecia in infected plant debris or conidia from collateral hosts
Secondary: Wind borne conidia

Favourable conditions: 


Morning relative humidity &gt; 90%
Cool and dry weather



Cucumber mosaic

Wide host range: 


Cucumber, Pumpkin, gourds, Cowpea, tomato, chilli, etc. Cucumovirus with spherical particles having ssRNA

Symptoms: 


Symptoms appear on the youngest and still expanding leaves when infection occurs at 6 – 8 leaves stage
Typical mosaic pattern develops on young leaves
Leaves curl downwards and become mottled, distorted, wrinkled and reduced in size
Veins appear bunchy because of shortening of internodes
When infection occurs at midseason previous growth remains normal and produces normal fruit
Fruit set is very less if infection occurs early in crop growth
Fruits are often misshapen, mottled, warty and reduced in size

Survival and spread: 


Primary: Virus particles on collateral and other weeds, ornamentals or crops Hosts: Banana, clover, corn, passion fruit, safflower, spinach, sugarbeet, wild cucumber, Commelina communis, C. diffusa, C. nudiflora, Solanum elaegnifolium, Phytolacca sp., periwinkle, Gladiolus sp., Impatiens sp. and Phlox
Secondary: Virus particles transmitted by aphids (Aphis craccivora, Myzus persicae) and spotted and striped cucumber beetles



Cercospora leaf spot

Host range: 


Common on watermelon, muskmelon and cucumber

Symptoms: 


Minute water soaked spots or yellow specks develop initially on leaves
Spots enlarge rapidly and becomes circular to irregular with pale brown, tan or white centers and purple to almost black margins
Spots coalesce to form large blotches
The leaf may dry and die presenting the leaf a scorched appearance
Fruits are also occasionally attacked

Survival and spread: 


Primary: Dormant mycelium or conidia on infected plant debris or collateral hosts
Secondary: Wind borne conidia

Fusarium wilt

Damage symptoms: 


The first symptom of the disease is clearing of the veinlets and chlorosis of the leaves.
The younger leaves may die in succession and the entire may wilt and die in a course of few days.
Soon the petiole and the leaves droop and wilt.
In young trailing plant, symptom consists of clearing of veinlet and dropping of petioles. In field, yellowing of the lower leaves first and affected leaflets wilt and die.
The symptoms continue in subsequent leaves. At later stage, browning of vascular system occurs. Plants become stunted and die.

Survival and spread: 


Soil and implements

Favourable conditions: 


Relatively high soil moisture and soil temperature 

Diseases cycles

Downy mildew: Pseudoperonospora cubensis



Powdery mildew: Erysiphe cichoracearum DC, Sphaerotheca fuligena (Schltdl.) Pollacci



Cercospora leaf spot: Cercospora leaf spot C. citrullina, C. melonis, C. lagenarium



Fusarium wilt: Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht
