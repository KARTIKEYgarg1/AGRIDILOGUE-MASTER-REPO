Custard Apple: Crop stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre planting*




Common cultural practices: • Timely sowing should be done. • Field sanitation, rogueing • Destroy the alternate host plants • Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations


Nutrients
• Pits (50 x 50 x 50cm) are to   be dug during summer season and kept open for controlling soil borne   pests. • Pits should be filled with a mixture of top soil and farmyard manure in   1:1 ratio a fortnight before planting.


Weeds
• Cultivate the field before   planting to destroy existing weeds in the field. • Summer ploughing is helpful in destroying weeds seeds and rhizomes in the   soil. • Adopt stale seed bed technique


Resting   stages of diseases &amp;pests and nematodes
Cultural control: • Dig the planting pit during summer season and keep it open for at least   one month. • Soil solarization: Cover the pits with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45   mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will   help in reducing the soil borne pests. • Apply neem cake @ 2 kg/pit.



Planting*




Common cultural practices: • Use healthy, certified and weed free seeds.


Nutrient
• Planting is done in rainy   season at a distance of 4m x 4m. • Add Trichoderma and Mycorrhiza mixture @ 50 g per pit at the time of   planting. • Apply 300 g of fertilizers mixture of Urea, Single super phosphate and   muriate of potash in equal proportion are added in each pit.


Weed
• Remove existing weeds in and   around the pits at the time of planting. • Mulching with organic or biodegradable material.


Soil   borne diseases and nematodes
Cultural control: • Make a trench keeping the distance from the main stem as per the plant   canopy width and apply neem cake @ 2 kg/ plant/pit.



Vegetative   stages (1-5 years)




Common cultural practices: • Destroy crop debris • Avoid water logging • Avoid water stress • Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval   parasitoids are observed • Custard apple bears flowers on current season growth and very rarely on   older branches. The early completion of season is essential for the   initiation of new growth. Therefore manual defoliation during the mid-summer   is recommended. Common mechanical practices: • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such   as King crow, common mynah etc. Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies


Nutrient

Application of manures &amp;   fertilizers: (per plant) The bearing trees of Custard apple should be fertilized as follows

 


2nd   to 5th year


FYM
30 kg


N
400 g


P
250 g


K
800 g



 • Nitrogen should be applied in the form of FYM and oil cakes each at 25%   and the remaining 50% with chemical fertilizers. While P2O5 in the form of   super phosphate and K2O in the form of sulphate of potash. • Manures are applied in 2 to 3 equal doses i.e. first dose in   December-January, 2nd done in June-July, 3rd dose in September, Potash   application can be reduced if the soil is rich in this nutrient. • Nitrogen containing fertilizers should be applied in three equal splits   in January, July and November months; phosphorus containing fertilizers in   two splits in January and July months and Potassium containing fertilizers   may be applied as singly dose in January. • Adopt ring method of fertilizer application. • A mixture of zinc sulphate 0.5%, manganese sulphate 0.2%, boric acid   0.1%, urea 1% and lime 0.4% has to be sprayed two or three times in a year to   control chlorosis in leaves. • Intercrops: During pre bearing period short growing crops like groundnut,   ragi, bajra wheat, pulses and vegetables (except solanaceous crops) can be   profitably grown in the inter spaces. • In the bearing orchards green manure crops like sunhemp, green gram,   cowpea etc., are raised and incorporated into the soil during the monsoon   period.



Weeds
• Timely Interculture and hand   weeding should be done with hand tools for initial 5 years. • Mulching: After weeding and manuring, application of dry-leaf mulch or   paddy husk to a thickness of 8 cm in the basin keeps down the weed growth and   decreases the number of irrigations, and improves the fruit quality. • In the initial years of planting, intercrops like groundnut, minor   millets, linseed and gram should be grown.


Mealy   bug
Cultural control:  • Collect and destroy the mealy bug infested leaves, twigs and   fruits. • Flooding of orchard with water in the month of October kill the   eggs. • Ploughing of orchard in November.  • Avoid plant stresses - healthy plants are much less susceptible to attack    Biological control:  • Release Cryptolaemous montrouzieri beetles @ 10/tree or @ 30 larvae/plant   twice at 15 days interval. • The Coccinellid Menochilus (Chilomenes) sex maculatus (F) is a predator   of the nymphs and adults, and the Hymenopterous parasite Anaysis alcocki   (Ashm.) Anagyrus dactylopii and Aenasius advena are three parasitoids on   mealy bugs. • Release of coccinellid Scymnus coccivora @ 10 beetles /tree or @ 30 larvae/plant   is a good predator of both nymphs and adults.


Scale   insect
Cultural control: • Collect and destroy damaged leaves • Apply well rotten sheep manure @ 4 t/ acre in two splits or poultry   manure in 2 splits • Control ants and dust which can give the scale a competitive   advantage. Biological control: • Field release of ladybird beetle. • Spray dormant oil in late winter before spring. • Spray horticultural oil, if needed, year round.


Anthracnose
Cultural Control: • Prune dead twigs before flowering,   and remove infected fruit and dead leaves regularly. • Leaf and soil analysis should be   done to maintain adequate nutrient concentration in plants particularly   calcium and nitrogen • Avoid planting susceptible   varieties.


Leaf   spot(S)
Cultural control: • Collect and burn the infected plant parts to minimize the spread of the   disease. • Increase air circulation by proper training and pruning.

Note: The pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on   high volume sprayer. * Apply Trichoderma viride/harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens as   seed/seedling/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if   commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides   produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not   required).
