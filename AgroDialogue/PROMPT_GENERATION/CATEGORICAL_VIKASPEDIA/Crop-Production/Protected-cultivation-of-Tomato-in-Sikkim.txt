Protected cultivation of Tomato in Sikkim


Sikkim is gifted with suitable climates for round the year tomato  cultivation. It is cultivated in the open field during rabi season and  under protected condition during summer and rainy season.

Protected structures

The main purpose of protected cultivation is to create a favorable  environment for the sustained yield as to realize its maximum potential  even in adverse climatic conditions. The protected structures may be a  high cost or low cost polyhouse, net house, tunnels etc. a partially  ventilated low cost polyhouse with both polythene and agroshed net may  be suitable for farmers.

The site for protected cultivation should be accessible, sunny, with  no water-logging. To minimize the diseases, new area should be selected  for cultivation. The soil should be well-drained, loamy with adequate  organic matter (> 2.0%). Crops are successfully grown in the  moderately acidic soils (pH 6.0- 7.5). The pH can be maintained by  adding lime/dolomite @ 100g/m2

Climate

Tomato prefers moderate temperature and thrives well in the  temperature range of 25 – 30oC. The prevalence of low temperature and  high humidity causes severe infestation of diseases.

Nursery management

Seeds are sown in raised beds under protected structures. Seeds can  be sown about 20 – 25 days before planting. The average seed rate for  tomato is 350 – 400 g/ha. Seeds are sown with row spacing of 10 cm and  seed spacing of 0.5cm. Densely  populated seeds produce weak seedlings. The beds should be drenched  with Trichoderma+ Pseudomonas culture @ 2 % to manage damping off.

Varieties

Indeterminate tomato varieties are suitable for cultivation under  polyhouse. Avtar, Indam Hybrid, All Rounder, Arka Meghali, Arka Surabhi,  etc. are suitable varieties for tomato Indeterminate tomato varieties are  suitable for cultivation under polyhouse. Avtar, Indam Hybrid, All  Rounder, Arka Meghali, Arka Surabhi, etc. are suitable varieties for  tomato cultivation.

Planting

Tomato should be planted on the raised bed with the bed width of  1.5m. There should be a path of 0.6m between two beds. 20 – 25 day old  seedlings should be planted at the distance of 1.0 x 0.8m. Before  planting, the root of seedlings should be dipped for 15 minutes in  Trichoderma + Pseudomonas culture @ 10%. Planting should preferably be  done in small pits for better root development.

Nutrient Management

The nutrient requirement of tomato is moderately high ( N 100, P 60, K  80 kg/ ha) and shows good response with the addition of nutrients. FYM  should be applied @ 5.0 kg/ m2 along with neem cake @ 200g/ m2. At the  time of planting, seedling should be treated with Azospirillum + PSB  (20%) for 15 minutes. The addition of vermicompost @ 1 kg/ m2 further  improves the production.

Interculture and irrigation

Tomato is a shallow rooted crop and roots are restricted within 15 –  20 cm of soil. So, light earthing up should be done after 30 days and 45  days of planting. Good quality water should be applied at 10 days interval. The plants  should be provided with strong multiple stakes after one month of  planting.

Diseases and Pests

Late blight

Late blight of tomato is the most devastating disease caused by a  fungus Phytophthora infestans. It infects and destroys the leaves, stems  and fruits. Its infection is most rapid during conditions of high moisture and moderate temperatures (20-25oC).

Management


Nursery - Soil treatment with Trichoderma culture @ 2%
Soil drenching with Trichoderma culture @ 2% before planting
Seedling treatment with Trichoderma culture @ 10% for 15 minutes
Soil drenching with Bordeaux mixture (1:1:100) after 15 days of planting
Spray of Bordeaux mixture (1:1:100) at fortnightly interval after one month of planting.
In severe infection, application of Ridomil/Matko @ 2g/ l manages the diseases effectively.

Early blight

Early blight of tomato, caused by the fungus  Alternaria solani, is a common foliar disease of tomato. This disease causes direct losses by the infection of fruits and  indirect losses by reducing plant vigor. The disease can be managed by  spray of Bordeaux mixture (1:1:100).

Grey mould

Grey mold a fungal disease (Botrytis cinerea), is an important  disease of tomato and its infection occurs after flowering and fruit  set. In case of severe infection, flowers and pedicel starts dying and  in later stage fruits also start rotting. The infection starts from peduncle edn and infected fruits are not suitable for consumption.

Management

Application of Bordeaux mixture (1:1:100) after one month of  planting. In case of severe infestation, spray of Kavach (Clorothalonil)  @ 1.5 g/ l minimizes the infection.

Cercospora leaf spot

It is one of the important foliar disease caused by Cercospora sp.  Infected leaf has brown spots with curled leaf margin and late on, it  withers. As the disease progresses, the leaflets turn yellow and also  with curled margins. Spots on the leaf petioles, stems and flower parts  become elongated and have dark – brown color. In heavily infested plant,  defoliation may occur. The disease can be managed by the application of  Bordeaux mixture (1:1:100)

Fruit borer

Fruit borer (Helicoverpa armigera) is the most important pest of  tomato. It causes serious damage during the fruit development and  ripening. The larva feeds on the pulp by making hole. The infested fruit is not suitable for consumption.

Management

Application of NPV (Helicide) @ 0.5 ml/ l after 15 days of fruit set.

Yield

The average yield of tomato under protected condition may vary  between 6 -8 kg/ m2 if proper care is taken. The average yield per plant  may be 3 – 4 kg/ plant with the fruit number of 40 – 60 / plant and  fruit weight 80 – 90 g.

Profitability

The cultivation of tomato is highly profitable if fruits are  harvested between June -October. The cost of cultivation may vary from  Rs 20 – 25/ m2, while the earning may be between Rs. 100 – 130 / m2. The  cost benefit ratio in tomato is generally as high as 1:4.
