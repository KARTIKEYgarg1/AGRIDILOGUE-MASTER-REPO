Real-time Weather Forecast


Real time availability of weather information by IMD
 



Under the network of observatories related to agrometeorology, at present there are 263 Agromet observatories,  			42 Evapotranspiration Stations, 43 Soil Moisture Stations and 76 Dew gauge stations in the country.  			In collaboration with these observatories, the Agrometeorology division of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is exploring to develop a suitable National network of  			Agromet Observatories for effective use of real time agromet data in Agromet Advisory Services (AAS). Under this  			National network all the observatories will get access of agromet data of their own station in addition to other stations  			online. This data will be of much use for preparation of district as well as block level agromet advisories.

Real Time Weather Forecasting by C-DAC
Real Time Weather Forecasting is very important for weather scientists, operational meteorologists, and aviation/ transport industry as well as policy makers. The Computational Earth Science (CES) group of Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) has developed an automated workflow for real time weather simulations: “Anuman” using Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model     of National Centre of Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA. This tool provides high-resolution weather simulations and number of different weather forecast products useful as a decision support for various user communities.
Salient features of Anuman

 End-to-end forecasting system 
 Timely generation of important weather forecast products for many applications "On-Demand" 
 Local-area, short-term, model based weather forecasting customized by location, application and dissemination
Current forecasts available for several different states/village areas
Capability of creating forecast products up to 4 km resolution
The location specific real time weather forecasts are useful for the decision making in terms of weather conditions over a particular area.
The WRF outputs would be useful as an input for hydrology models
