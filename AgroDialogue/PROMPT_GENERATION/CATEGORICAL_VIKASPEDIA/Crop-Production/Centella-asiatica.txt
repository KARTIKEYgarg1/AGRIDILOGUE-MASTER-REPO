Agro-technique

Nursery Technique


Raising Propagules: The plants grow well under shade and can tolerate heavy shade. One-node stem cuttings can be planted. The root develops from the nodes.
Propagule Rate and Pretreatment: 300 kg rooted suckers are needed to plant one hectare land. No specific pretreatment is required.

Planting in the Field


Land Preparation and Fertilizer Application: The field should be prepared well by giving one ploughing and two harrowings, followed by planting. Manure (FYM) at the rate of 20 t/ha should be mixed thoroughly with the soil at the time of field preparation. NPK fertilizers @ 100:50:50 kg/ha in 4 split doses are given.
Transplanting and Optimum Spacing: The planting can be done in February-March at a spacing of 45X45 cm with irrigation. It is an irrigated crop.
Intercropping System: The plant can be grown as pure crop in orchards of Mango and other trees.
Interculture and Maintenance Practices: There is a profuse growth of weeds in the beds; hence it requires continuous hoeing and weeding. During monsoon months, it is essential to prevent water logging in the beds.
Irrigation Practices: During dry months fortnightly irrigation is needed and needs drainage during rainy season.
Disease and Pest Control: No disease, pests or any other physiological disorder was observed in the experimental plantation.

Harvest Management


Crop Maturity and Harvesting: The crop matures in 90 days period after planting. It is harvested through hand-cutting at fully grown leaf stage. The leaves are harvested in sunny weather to facilitate drying.
Post-harvest Management: Unwanted material is sorted out from the crop before the harvested material is dried in shade.
Chemical Constituents: Asiatic acid, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, brahmic acid, thankuniside, centellose. Total triterpinoids are in leaves and they are approximately 1.0% of leaves.
Yield and Cost of Cultivation: As a pure crop, 10-12 t/ha/years yield is obtained by 3 harvests in a year. After second year, the yield begins to decline, needing fresh planting. Rs. 40000/- is the cost of cultivation for one hectare.
