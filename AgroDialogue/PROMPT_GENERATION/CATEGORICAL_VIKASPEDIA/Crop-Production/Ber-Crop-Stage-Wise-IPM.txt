Ber Crop Stage Wise IPM






Management
 
Activity




Pre- planting




 


Common cultural practices: 

Deep ploughing of fields during summer. 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Use resistant/tolerant varieties. 
Grow the attractant, repellent plants around   the field bunds. 
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test   recommendations





Nutrients



Apply nutrients on the basis of soil test   report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
The pits of 60x60x60 cm size are dug during   summer are dug in summer a month before planting. 
Fill the pits with top soil mixed with 25 kg   FYM treated with Trichoderma .





Weeds



Ploughing, harrowing, leveling and removing   the weeds before planting.





Soil-borne pathogens, and resting stages of insects


Cultural control: 

Deep summer ploughing of fields to exposes   dormant stages (pupa and larva) and subsequently reduces their initial   population build up.





Planting




 


Common cultural practices: 

Plant resistant varieties. 
Practice field sanitation. 
Timely planting with recommended spacing.





Nutrients



·   Planting is done in pits already filled with top soil and farm yard manure. 
Apply 20 g each of Azospirullum and   mycorrhizae per plant at planting.





Weeds



Use weed free seedlings for planting.
Remove existing weeds in and around the pits   at the time of planting.





Diseases and insect pests


Cultural control: 

Grow resistant varieties viz., Safeda   selected, glory, Dhaka 1 and Dhaka – 2 resistant to powdery mildew, Banarsi   Pewandi, Ajmeri, Gola,Gurgaon and Jhajjar resistant to fruit borer and Umran,   Tikkady tolerant to fruit fly 
Follow ring method for irrigation to reduce   collar rot





Leaf spot


Cultural control: 

Avoid planting in low-lying areas and   flooding. 
Do not delay irrigation until the crop   exhibits moisture stress symptoms.





Die back**


Cultural control: 

Scion wood selected for propagation should be   free from infection 
Prevent introduction of disease in newly   planted orchards.

 Mechanical control: 

Any infected portion be pruned immediately,   followed by pasting with cow dung at the cut ends. 
Pruning should be done in such a way that some   healthy portion is also removed, to ensure complete eradication of pathogen   (3 “below the infection site).





Application of Trichoderma harzianum/ viride and Pseudomonas   fluorescens for treatment of seed/seedling/planting materials in the   nurseries and field application (if commercial products are used, check for   label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption   in their fields, registration is not required).




Vegetative stage




 


Common cultural practices: 

Deep ploughing (two/three times) between rows   to expose the hibernating pupae to sunlight and predatory birds. 
Keep the orchard clean and healthy 
Remove and destroy alternate wild hosts 

Common mechanical practices: 

Prune diseased leaves and malformed panicles   harbouring the pathogen to reduce primary inoculum load. 
Remove and destroy the diseased orchard. 
Remove plant debris 
The infected branches should be collected and   burnt 
Remove the infected leaves in the lower rows. 
Set up light trap@1trap/acre 
Collect and destroy egg mass and larvae. 
Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5/acre 

Common biological practices: 

Conserve natural enemies through ecological   engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies





Nutrients



Apply fertilizers according to the age of   plant as mentioned below;





Manures &amp; Fertilizers (per plant/year)

The manures and fertilizers should be applied   in 20-30 cm deep and 30 cm wide trench along the drip line of the tree.





Weeds



Intercultural operations like ploughing,   harrowing etc. should be done on regular basis especially around the plants. 
To suppress the weeds between rows, leguminous   crops like green gram, mothbean, clusterbean, chickpea, cow pea and   vegetables e.g. chillies can be grown as intercrops during initial 5 years. 
Use straw or black polyethylene ‘mulch’ to   avoid weed growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period. 
Use slashing and moving between the rows to   control the weeds.





Leaf spot



As mentioned above in the seedling stage





Powdery mildew


Cultural control: 

Spraying at full bloom needs to be avoided. 
Alkathene bands should be cleaned at regular   interval 

Chemical control: 

Spraying of carbendazim 50% WP @ 10 g diluted   in 10 l water per tree.





Blue butter fly


Cultural control: 

Remove the infested leaves from the plant. 





Green slug Caterpillar


Cultural control: 

Leaflets have to be observed for fresh   incidence by cutting 1-2 leaf fronds.





Grey hairy caterpillar


Cultural control: 

Irrigate once to avoid prolonged mid-season   drought to prevent pre-harvest infestation. 

Mechanical control: 

Dig the pit of 1 inch depth between the   orchids &amp; dust to kill the larvae in pits. 

Biological control: 

Follow common biological practices.





Bark eating caterpillar


Cultural control: 

Remove frassy galleries and paint the bark. 
Application of the solution, made up by mixing   1 lit of kerosene and 100 g soap in 9 lit of water to the holes effectively   controls the bark eating caterpillar.





Mite


Cultural control: 

Regular field monitoring &amp; use sweep net   in the morning hrs for monitoring of pest &amp; defender population, barrier   crops like mustard crop around the field. 
Grow attractant plants like French bean 
Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum or   millet to reduce pest population. 

Biological control: 

Follow common biological practices. 
Plant tall border crops such as maize, sorghum   etc. as barrier crops





 


Cultural control: 

Avoid excess use of nitrogen. 
Growing tomato or marigold as a trap crop. 

Mechanical control: 

See the common mechanical practices 

Biological control: 

Follow common biological practices.





Leaf eating caterpillar


Mechanical control: 

At early and smaller scale, pluck the leaves   with egg masses and young caterpillars and destroy.





Lac insect


Mechanical control: 

Remove and destroy the infested dry part and   scrap off the infested twig before treatment





Reproductive/ Fruiting stage




Nutrients



Spray 2% KNO3 thrice at monthly intervals in   January, February and March. 
Apply recommended micronutrients, if   deficiency symptoms are observed. 
For the correction of Zinc and Boron   deficiency, apply Zinc suphate @ 0.5% and Boric acid @ 0.1%, respectively as   foliar spray.





Weeds



Remove weeds around the plants. 
Continue to use straw or black polyethylene   mulch to avoid weed growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period.





Fruit fly


Cultural control: 

Clean cultivation/sanitation of orchards by   picking and destroying the infested fruits should be done. 
To escape egg laying on fruits, harvest at   green and firm stage and do not allow the fruit to ripe on the tree. 
Destroy the hibernating pupae by exposing them   to bright sunlight and birds 
Prior to harvest, collect and dispose off   infested and fallen fruits to prevent further, multiplication and carry-over   of population. 
If infestation is heavy, bait splash on the   trunk only, once or twice at weekly interval is recommended. To prepare bait   splash, mix 100 g of jaggery in one litre of water and add 1 ml of   deltamethrin by using an old broom. 

Mechanical control: 

Male annihilation technique: Set up fly trap   using methyl eugenol. Prepare methyl eugenol 1 ml/L of water + 1 ml of   malathion solution. Take 10 ml of this mixture per trap and keep them at 25   different places in one ha between 6 and 8 AM. 
Collect and destroy the adult flies.

Biological control: 

Follow common biological practices.
The extract of azadiractin 1% and Ocimum   sanctum 1% were effective up to 10 days after spraying. Application of neem   powder and tobacco leaf extracts would also significantly reduce C. vesuviana   damage and they could be the potential candidates for organic cultivation of   ber





Fruit borer


Cultural control: 

Removal of wild ber trees around the ber   orchard. Rack the soil under the tree or near the trees to destroy the   maggots and pupae present in the soil. 
Collection and proper destruction of infested   fallen fruits. Harvest of fruits at immediate after maturity (green stage).





Stone weevil**


Cultural control: 

The pest feeds only on the seed portion of   developing fruits and arrest further development of attacked fruit. 
The entry hole is healed up and closed while   the exit hole can be clearly seen. 
Collection and destruction of adult weevil   immediately after detection can also reduce the population. Infested dropped   fruits should be collected and burned to break the generation cycle.





Mite, Leaf eating caterpillar and Lac insect



As mentioned in the above vegetative stage





Fruit rot


Cultural control: 

Using disease-free transplants is the most   effective method for controlling. 
Use of drip irrigation, limits the dispersal   of the pathogen. 
Plants are also more sensitive to infection   under high fertility conditions. 
Reduced nitrogen rates or the use of nitrate   rather than ammonium nitrogen sources may also reduce





Powdery mildew



As mentioned in the above vegetative stage





Sooty mould


Cultural control:

Pruning of affected branches and their prompt   destruction prevents the spread of the disease





Birds


Mechanical control: 

Use bird scarers 

Biological control: 

Apply NSKE 5% on panicle to save the damage   from birds





Note: The pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on high volume spray.
