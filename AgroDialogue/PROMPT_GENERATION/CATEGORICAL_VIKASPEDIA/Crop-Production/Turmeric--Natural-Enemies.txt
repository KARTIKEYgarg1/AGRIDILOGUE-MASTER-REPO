Natural   enemies
Attractant/Repellent/Trap plants


Shoot borer:


•   Parasitoids: Bracon sp (larval), myosoma sp (larval), Apanteles sp (larval) ,   Xanthopimpla sp (larval and pupal) etc., • Predators: Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi, coccinellids, king crow, wasp,   dragonfly, spiders, robber fly, reduviid bug, praying mantids, fire ants   Entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) of the genus Rhabditis/ Oscheius and   Hexamermis sp.
• Attractant plants for natural   enemies: Carrot family, sunflower family, buckwheat, alfalfa, corn, shrubs   (minute pirate bug, lacewing and ladybird beetle). • Nectar rich plants with small flowers i.e. anise, caraway, dill, parsley,   mustard, sunflower, buckwheat and cowpea (braconid wasp) • Maintaining hedgerows around the turmeric plantation also helps to   maintain a population of ladybird beetle, spiders, etc. • Mulching with green leaves @ 4–4.5 t/acre at the time of planting. It is   repeated @ 2 t/acre at 40 and 90 days after planting. • Use of Lantana camara and Vitex negundo as mulch at the time of planting   may reduce the infection of shoot borer. • EPN, Rhabditis/Oscheius as biopesticides for management of the shoot   borer and other insect pests of turmeric.


Leaf roller:


•   Parasitoids: Apanteles sp, Sympiesis sp, Brachymeria oxodentata • Parasite: Ceromyia sp.
• Attractant plants for natural   enemies: Carrot family, sunflower family, buckwheat, cowpea, alfalfa, corn,   shrubs (Apanteles sp, Sympiesis sp, Brachymeria oxodentata &amp; Ceromyia   sp). • Nectar rich plants with small flowers i.e. anise, caraway, dill, parsley,   mustard, sunflower, buckwheat and cowpea (Apanteles sp, Sympiesis sp,   Brachymeria oxodentata)


Rhizome / soft rot:



• Incorporation of neem cake and   pine needle in the soil. • Different types of cropping systems cropping like maize, chili, brinjal,   papaya, cucumber, pumpkin, yam, tree tomato, tapioca and different types of   leguminous crops. • Application of oil cakes made from Azadirachta indica, Calophyllum   inophyllum, Pongamia glabra, Hibiscus sabdariffa and Brassica   campestris • Intercrop turmeric with maize and pineapple.


Root-knot nematode:



• Intercropping with marigold @   5:1 • Repellant plants for nematodes: Marigold, Gliricidia, Asparagus, Dahelia   etc. • Crop rotation: Marigold, Chrysanthemum, Sesbania, Crotalaria spp.,   Gaillardia, cluster bean and Desmodium spp., • Border crops: Strips of ryegrass, cover crops and mulch beds (rove   beetle) • Soil incorporation of Gliricidia compost, neem seed cake.
