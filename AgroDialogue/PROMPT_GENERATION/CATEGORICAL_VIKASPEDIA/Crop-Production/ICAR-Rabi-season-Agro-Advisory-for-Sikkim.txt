ICAR Rabi season Agro Advisory for Sikkim

General Advisory for Rabi Season


Sowing should be done within the optimum sowing time of the rabi crops.
Mulching should be done through locally available biomass to conserve soil moisture for rabi crops and suppress the weed growth.
Zero till cultivation of vegetable pea/toria/buckwheat can be taken up in rice fallow to utilize the residual soil moisture.
Nursery should be raised for cole crops (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli), onion, rayasaag etc. under protected condition.
Nursery bed should be protected from rain (Silpauline: 45GSM) to avoid losses during unexpected rain.
COVID protocol and measures to be followed while working in the field.
Application of lime @ 1 t/ha 15-20 days before sowing the seed may be done for increasing availability of nutrients to the plants.
For plant protection measures, spray neem-based formulation (1500 ppm) @ 0.3% as and when required to all the crops.

Apply FYM @ 5 t/ha and vermicompost @ 1t/ ha.

Horticultural crops


At fruiting stage such as orange, kiwifruit utmost precaution should be taken during filed operation to avoid root damage.
Ensure proper storage of harvested fruit crop to ensure better price realization like cold storage etc.
Precautions to be taken for direct marketing of harvested vegetables and fruits.
In orange, FYM @ 20 kg/plant should be applied in the month of April-May every year.

Vegetable pea/Field pea:


Zero till cultivation of vegetable/field pea should be practiced.
Sowing should be done with spacing of 30-4 0cm x 10 cm and seed rate @ 60-70 kg/ha
Apply lifesaving irrigation for better yield
Apply FYM @ 2 t/ha + vermicompost @ 1 t/ ha during the time of sowing.

Cole cops (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli) and tomato


Nursery should be raised in protected condition to avoid untimely rain and low temperature.
The nursery site should be dry and free from water stagnation as well as high moisture in the soil.
The nursery bed should be prepared by mixing well decomposed FYM or compost @ 4 kg/m2.
25-30 days old sapling should be transplanted with spacing of 40-50 cm row to row and plant to plant.
Transplant the seedling must be done in the evening and irrigate immediately.
Apply FYM @ 7-8 t/ha + vermicompost @ 1-2 t/ ha for getting higher yield.

Root crop (radish, carrot)


Soak the seed of carrot overnight in water before sowing for early germination.
Seed should be sown on the raised bed of 30-40 cm width.
Apply FYM @ 8-10 t/ha + vermicompost @ 1-2 t/ ha for getting higher yield.
Spacing for carrot- Row to row: 20-30 cm and plant to plant:5-10 cm and
radish - row to row: 30-40 cm and plant to plant: 5-10 cm should be maintained for good crop yield.
To maintain proper spacing thinning should be done after 10-15 DAS

Potato


Potato should be planted in the middle of October – middle of November for higher yield in rice-fallow to utilize the residual soil moisture.
Apply well rotten FYM @ 12-15 t/ha along with vermicompost @2-3 t/ha in the line during the time of planting.
Tuber size 40-50 g in weight should be planted with row-row spacing of 50-60 cm and plant-plant20 cm.
One irrigation is necessary for getting good yield.
Good moisture to be maintained in the field to avoid the red ants’ infestation.

Livestock specific advisory

Cattle and Goats


Strict hygiene and sanitation need to maintain at the farm premises to prevent the incidence of diseases.
Regular supplementation of mineral mixture @50-60g/day to adult cows and calcium to the lactating and pregnant cows @70-80ml/day/cow is very much essential for milking cows for getting optimum production and productivity and avoid disease occurrence.
Follow good management practices related to feeding, watering, housing (clean, dry, well ventilated) and general hygiene to keep animals healthy.
Calves should be de-wormed as early as 21 days with Piperazine against round worm @110-130mg/kg body weight. Adult cow should be de-wormed preferably with Fenbendazole @7mg/kg body weight.
Ensure de-worming of goats with Albendazole @ 7.5mg/kg body weight. In case of pregnant dose, pregnancy safe anthelmentics (Fenbendazole 25mg/kg body weight) should be administered 15 days prior to expected date of kidding. 
Feed materials should be store in dry place to avoid possible fungal growth (Aflatoxicosis).
Foot bath should be made at the entry point of the farm to reduce the contamination.
Balance and timely feeding (dry fodder, roughages, concentrate, vitamin, minerals,) should be practice for the optimum production and good health.
Avoid slippery floor especially in case of pregnant cattle.
Timely vaccination and deworming should be practice.

Poultry Birds


Litter materials should be dried and frequently changed in the poultry farm to prevent the incidence of coccidiosis.
Proper ventilation and spacing should be followed in poultry farm to prevent the incidence of diseases.
Provide artificial heating to poultry birds (day old to 25 days old) through lightning of electric bulb to protect them from low temperature during nighttime.
Keep the poultry house well ventilated during daytime.
Vaccinate against Ranikhet, IBD, Fowl pox, Marek disease in poultry birds.
Poultry birds should be de-wormed with piperazine @32mg/ kg in two consecutive feed or water against round worms and Albendazole against other worm @10mg/kg body weight with or without Praziquantel @5 mg/kg body weight and depending upon age of the bird.

Piggery


Pigs should be de-wormed with Albendazole @5 mg/kg body weight and Piperazine specifically against round worm @110- 200mg/kg body weight. 
Pig farmers are advised for regular supplementation of mineral mixture @50-60 gm/day for pregnant sow and calcium to the lactating sows @60-80 ml/day/sow.
Restrict the movement of visitors into the farms and follow strict bio-security measures. Use of good disinfectant in foot bath.
In pigs vaccinate against Swine fever. Vaccination for FMD, BQ and HS for bovines.
Creep box with heating source (bulb) should be used in piglets’ pens to reduce the mortality due to trampling by the snow and cold shock.
