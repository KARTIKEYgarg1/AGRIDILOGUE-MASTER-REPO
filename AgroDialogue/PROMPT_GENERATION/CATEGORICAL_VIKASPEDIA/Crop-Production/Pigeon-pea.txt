Pigeon pea


Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), commonly known as red gram or tur or Arhar, is a very  old  crop  of  this  country.  After  gram,  arhar  is  the  second  most  important pulse crop in the country. It is mainly eaten in the form  of split pulse as ‘dal’.  Seeds of arhar are also rich in iron, iodine,  essential amino acids like lycine, threonine, cystine and arginine etc.

More than 80% of tur production comes  from  6  states  of  Maharashtra,  MP,  Karnataka,  UP,  Gujarat  and  Jharkhand.

Climate

Pigeonpea is predominantly a crop of tropical areas mainly cultivated in  semi arid regions  of India. Pigeonpea can be grown with a  temperature ranging from 260C to 300C in the rainy  season (June to October) and 170C to 220C in the post rainy  (November to March) season.  Pigeonpea is very sensitive to low radiation at pod development, therefore flowering during  the monsoon and cloudy weather, leads to poor pod formation.

Soil type and Field Preparation

It is successfully grown in black cotton soils, well drained with a  p H  ranging from 7.0 - 8.5.  Pigeonpea responds well to properly tilled and we ll drained seedbed. A deep  ploughing with  soil  turning  plough  in  fallow/waste  lands,  zero  tillage  sowing  under  intensive  cropping  system and  Broad  Bed Furrow/Ridge - furrow planting in low lying as well as intercropping  areas  is  recommended.  Raised  Bed  method  of  planting  by  dibbling  at  2  inches  depth  with  Row to Row distance 4 to 5 feet also 15 feet gap (2 pairs of Tur on bed) under intercropping  of  soybean  under  transplanting  (Dharwad  method/SPI),  5 X 3  and  3  X  1.5  feet  spacing  is  recommended.

Sowing Time and Method

Early Maturing varieties - First fortnight of June;  Medium & Late Maturing Varieties - Second  fortnight  of  June.  Line  sowing  by  seed  drill  or  desi  plough  or  by  dibbling  on  the  ridge  and  beds, both are recommended as per the area.

Seed Rate and Spacing

The  seeding  rate  of  pigeon pea  depends  on  the  desired  plant  density  for  a  genotype  (early,  medium or late), cropping system (pure crop, mixed crop, or inter crop), germination rate of  seed and mass of seed.

Early Maturing Var. - 20 - 25 k g/ha (Row to Row - 45 - 60 cm & Plant to Plant - 10 - 15 cm)

Medium/Late Maturing Var. - 15 - 20  k g/ha  (Row to Row - 60 - 75 & Plant to Plant - 15 - 20 cm)



Fungicide: Thiram (2gm)  + Carbendazim (1gm) or Thiram @ 3 gm or Tricoderma virdie  5 - 7 g / k g of seed;

Culture: Rhizobium  and PSB  culture  7 - 10  g / k g seed.

Method of Sowing

Three systems of sowings are practiced for pigeon pea. The common is flat sowing, the other  methods  are  broadbed - furrow  (BBF)  for  extra - early  group  and  ridge-and-furrow  for  the  late  maturity group. Bund cultivation of pigeonpea in rice fallow areas have also been adopted in  Chattisgarh and MP  and  some  rice  fallow  areas.

The  latter  two  methods  are  useful  in  fields  with  poor  surface drainage and water logging. The raised beds or ridges also provide better aeration and  nodulation in comparison to the flat sown crop. At ICRISAT a broad bed and furrow system  is  used  for  sowing  extra-early  genotypes,  and  ridges-and-furrows  are  used  for  medium  and  late duration  genotypes.

Cropping system

The space between the rows could be profitably utilized by growing short  duration crops such as urd, moong, cowpea, etc.

Important cropping systems followed are:


Maize – Pigeonpea (Rabi)
Pigeonpea - Urd - Wheat
Pigeonpea - Sugarcane 
Mung + Pigeonpea - Wheat
Pigeonpea (early) - Potato - urdbean

Inter-cropping

Pigeonpea  is  commonly  intercropped  with  a  wide  range  of  crops. In  India,  it  was  estimated  that 80 - 90 % of the pigeonpea were intercropped :


With cereals  (sorghum, maize, pearl millet, finger millet  and rain-fed rice). 
With legumes (groundnut, cowpea, mung bean, black gram, soybean ).
With long-season annuals (caster,  cotton, sugarcane, and cassava). 

Fertilizer and Manure application

The doses of fertilizers should be determined based on the results of soil test.  All the fertilizers  are drilled in furrows at a depth of 5 cm. and at the side of 5 cm. from seed.  Apply 25 - 30 kg  N, 40 - 50  k g P 2 O 5 , 30 kg K 2 O per ha area as Basal dose at the time of sowing.

Secondary  and Micro  Nutrients 


Sulphur : In medium black soils and  sandy loam soils  apply 20 kg S ha-1 (equivalent to 154 kg  gypsum/phospho-gypsum or 22 kg bentonite sulphur) as basal to each crop. If S deficiency is  diagnosed red  sandy  loam  soils,  apply  40  kg  S  ha-1 (equivalent  to  300  kg  gypsum/phospho - gypsum/or 44 kg bentonite sulphur) per hectare.  This quantity is sufficient for one crop cycle. 
Zinc : In sandy soil, apply 3 kg Zn ha-1  (15 kg zinc sulphate hepta hydrate/ 9 kg zinc sulphate  mono hydrate) as basal. If Zinc deficiency  found in the standing crop can then spraying 5  kg  Zinc sulphate + Lime 2.5 k g dissolved in 800-1000 liter  water per  hectare. 
Iron : In  light  textured  soils,  foliar  application  of  0.5%  FeSO4 at  60,  90  and  120  DAS  is  recommended. 

Irrigation and Drainage

Being  a  deep  rooted  crop,  it  can  to lerate  drought.  But  in  case  of  prolonged  drought  there  is  need of three irrigation.


1st at  branching stage (30  DAS)
2nd one in flowering stage (70 DAS)  and 
3rd at the time of podding stage (110 DAS).

A pre-requisite for the success of pigeonpea is  proper drainage. Ridge planting is effective in areas where sub-surface drainage is poor.  Th is  provide enough aeration for the roots during the period of excess rainfall.

Weed control

The first  60 days is very critical and harmful for the arhar crop. Two mechanical weedings one  at  20 - 25  days and  another  at  45 - 50 days  after  sowing  but  before  flowering are required.

The  Pre-emergence application  of  Pendimetha lin  @ 0.75 - 1 Kg  a.i.  per  ha in  400-600  liter  of  water kills the germinating seedlings of weeds and keep the field weed free for the first 50 days. If  weed found  from long time use  Fluchloralin 50 % EC (Basaline) 1 kg of a.i per ha in 800-1000 liter  well incorporated in the soil before sowing  or  Alachlor 50 %  EC (Laso) 2 - 2.5  kg a.i. per ha in  400-500 liter  of water as pre-emergence.

 Measures

Disease 

The important diseases of Pigeon pea are  Wilt, Sterility mosaic disease, Phytophthora blight,  Alternaria  blight,  Powdery  mildew. Symptoms  of  these  disease  and  their  suitable  control  measures are given below:

1. Wilt 

Symptoms: Xylem gradually develops black streaks, dark purple bands appear  on the stem surface plants extending upwards from the base. Main  stem of such plants is split open, intensive blackening of the xylem  can  be  seen.  In  humid  weather,  a  pinkish  mycelial  growth  is  commonly observed the basal portions of the wilted plants. It may  be seen in seedling, flowering & vegetative stage.

Control Measures 


Seed  Treatment  with  Trichoderma  viride @  10 g/kg  of  seed  or  Thirum   (2   gm) + Carbendazim   (1gm) / kg   of   seed;
Soil  application - T. viride – 2 .5 kg/ ha + 50 kg of well decomposed  FYM  or sand at 30 days after sowing.
Mixed cropping with sorghum;
Uproot wilted plants;
Avoid over or under  watering plants;
Amendment of soil with oil cakes, appliances of  trace elements such as boron, zinc and manganese and heavy dose of green leaf manure crops
Grow  resistant  varieties  like  Amar,  Azad,  Asha  (IPCL - 87119),  Maruthi,  C-11,  BDN-1,  BDN - 2, NP - 5, JKM - 189, C - 11, JKM - 7, BSMR - 853 &amp; BSMR - 736 etc. 

2. Sterility mosaic disease 

Symptoms : It is caused by mosaic virus & spread from plant to plant  under  field  conditions  through  Eriophyid  mite.  Leaves  become  small  and  cluster  near  branch  tips &  reduced  in  size. Plants  are  pale  green  and bushy in appearance, without of flowers and pods. Diseas ed plants  are  usually  in  groups.  It  may  be  seen in  Vegetative  growth &  Pre - flowers stage

Control Measures


Spray Fenazaquin  10 EC (Magister) @ 1 ml/lit er of  water  on  45  and  60  DAS; 
Rogue  out  the  infected  plants in  the  early  stages  of  growth;

Grow  resistant  varieties like Pusa - 885, Asha, Sharad (DA11), Narendra Arhar1, Bahar ,  BSMR - 853, BSMR  736, Rajeev Lochan, BDN - 708.

3. Phytophthora blight 

Symptoms:  Foliage  blight  symptoms  are  circular  or  irregular  water  soaked   lesions   on   leaves. The   lesions   on   stems   and   branches  increases rapidly, girdles, cracks and dries the stem. Infected stem and  branches break easily in the wind.

Control Measures


Seed  treated  with  Metalaxyl  35  WS @ 3  g/ kg  of  seed
Good  drainage  in  the  fields  and  the  plants  should  be protected  from  stem  injury
Crop  rotation  should  be  followed

4. Alternaria blight 

Symptoms: Symptoms  appear  on  all  aerial  part  of  plants  are  small,  circular,   necrotic   spots   that   develop   quickly,   forming   typical  concentric  rings.  The  spots  are  initially  light  brown  and  later  turn  dark  brown.  In  severe  infection,  defoliation  and  drying  of  infected leaves, branches and flower buds.

Control Measures


Spray  the   crop   with  Mancozeb 75   WP  @  2   g/liter   or  Carbendazim 50 WP @ 1g/liter of water; 
Cultivation of pigeonpea  on  ridges  with  proper  drainage  system  and  avoiding  the  sowing  in  heavy  soil  helpful  in  disease management; 
Grow resistant varieties like DA - 2, MA 128 - 1, MA 128 - 2 

Insect-Pests

 1. Pod borers 

Nature of Damage : It  is  widely  distributed  and  is  the  most  injurious  pest  of  early  and  medium  maturing  varieties.  The  larvae,  after  hatching,  feed  on  tender leaves and twigs but a pod formation they puncture pods and  feed  on  developing  grains.  It  may  be  seen  in  vegetative  & podding  stage.

Control Measures 


Use  H. armigera pheromone trap @ 12/ha
Spray the  crop with Emamectin benzoate  5%  SG  @ 220  g/ha.  or  Indoxacarb  15.8%  SC  @ 333  ml/ha
The  caterpillar  should  be  picked by hand after shaking the plants and destroyed  in the early stages of attack. 

2. Tur Pod fly 

Nature of damage : Stripes can be seen on the surface of the  affected grains, while the attacked pods are somewhat twisted or  deformed. In case of severe damage, as many as 80 percent pods  and 60 per cent grains may be damaged.

Control Measures


Spraying Neem seed kernel  extract (NSKE) 5 per cent at 50%  flowering stage to manage the insect’s populations;
Pest can be  controlled by spraying the crop with Monocrotophos (Nuvacron)  36 SL 1 liter  in 800 - 1000 litres of water per  hectare. 

3. Plume Moth 

Nature of damage:  The larvae damaged seeds as well cause  flowers, buds and pods to drop. The caterpillar is greenish - brown in  color and fringed with short hairs and spines. It also enters into the  pod and feeds  on developing grains.

Control Measures


 Apply the Neem oil 2%
Spray the crop with Azadirachtin  0.03 % WSP 2500 - 5000 g/ha or  Emamectin benzoate 5% SG @  220 g/ha  or Indoxacarb 15.8% SC @ 333 ml/ha . 

4. Pod-sucking bugs 

Nature of damage: Damaged seeds become shriveled, and develop  dark patches. Shedding of green  pods.

Control Measures


Soil application of carbofuran 3G @ 15 kg/ha at sowing;
Spray  the   crop   with   Ha NPV   3   x1012   POB/ha   in   0.1%   teepol;
Immature   bugs   can   be   handpicked   and   destroyed;
The  main natural  enemies of  bugs  are  egg  parasitoids,  ants and  birds  reported  reduce  feeding  by  green  shield  bugs;
Spraying  with  aromatic plants (e.g. gums, lantana, Neem-based pesticides). 

Harvesting & Threshing

With two third to three fourth pods at maturity judged by changing their colour to brown is  the best harvesting time. The plants are usually cut with a sickle within 75 cm above the  ground.  Harvested plants should be left in the field for sun drying  for 3-6 days depending on season.

Threshing is done either by beating the pods with stick or using Pullman thresher. The  proportion of seed to pods is generally 50 - 60%. The clean seeds should be sun dried for 3-4 days to bring their moisture content at 9-10% to  safely store in appropriate bins.

To avoid further development of bruchids and other storage  pests, it is recommended to fumigate the storage material before onset of monsoon and again  after the monsoon with ALP @ 1 - 2 tablets per tonne. The small quantity of the produce can  also be protected by mixing inert material (soft stone, lime, ash, etc) or by smearing  edible/non-edible vegetable oils or by mixing plant products like neem leaf powder at the rate  of 1- 2% w/w basis.

Yield

With use of improved technology of agronomic practices  pigeon pea may yield about 25-30  q/ha  from irrigated condition  and  15-20 q/ha   from un-irrigated condition. (depending upon  maturity group of variety and climate) and 50 - 60 q/ha of sticks for fuel, as well.

Recommendation to  achieve  higher production


Deep summer ploughing once in 3 years.
Application of fertilizer should be based on soil test value.
Seed treatment should be done before sowing. 
Use wilt and  Sterility Mosaic disease (SMD) resistant /tolerant  varieties BSMR 736, 853,  846, ICPL 96053, BDN 2010, ICPL 43, 44, IPA 203, 204, 234 and IPH 09 - 5 as per  suitability of region. ( IIPR  AICRP Pigeonpea ).
