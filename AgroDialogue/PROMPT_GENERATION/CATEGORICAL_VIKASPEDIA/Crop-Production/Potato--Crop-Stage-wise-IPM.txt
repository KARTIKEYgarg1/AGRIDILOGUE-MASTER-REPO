Potato: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre sowing*




Common cultural practices: • Summer deep ploughing • Soil solarization during summer. • Field sanitation, rogueing. • Avoid water logged conditions in the field. • Follow crop rotation. • Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations • Start to grow ecological engineering plants. • Sow/plant 4 rows of maize, sorghum, bajra (pearl millet) around the   potato crop field as a guard/barrier crop.


Nutrient
• Apply FYM @ 8 t/acre or   vermicompost @ 4-6 t/acre • Apply 2 Kg each of Azospirillum and Phosphobacterium with 10 Kg FYM /acre   as soil application before planting


Weed
• Stale seed bed technique   before sowing. • Destroy all the germinated weeds by shallow ploughing before sowing.


Soil   borne pathogens, nematodes and resting stages of insect pests
Cultural control: • Give light irrigation and cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge   (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing. • Raise African marigold in the nursery 15 days prior to sowing against   cyst nematode. • Use raised seed beds of more than 35cm height (for better water   drainage). Biological control: • Apply neem cake@ 80 Kg/acre.



Sowing*





Common cultural practices: • Use resistant/tolerant varieties. • Use healthy, certified and weed seed free tubers.


Nutrients
• Apply 48 Kg nitrogen (N), 16 Kg   phosphorus (P2O5) and 48 Kg potassium (K2O)/acre. • Apply N and K in two splits; half as basal and half as top dressing at 30   days after sowing.


Plant growth regulator (PGR)
• Dipp cut pieces of tuber   (seed) for 10 minutes in chlormequat chloride 50% SL @ 100 ppm solution.


Weeds
• Adopt recommended agronomic   practices like field preparation, time of sowing, row and plant spacing, gap   filling etc. to obtain the healthy plant stand to reduce the weed   menace. • If weed flora of the field is known based on previous season experience   the preemergence recommended herbicide oxyflourfen 23.5% EC @170-340 ml in   200-300 l water/ acre be applied within 3-4 days after sowing. • When 5-10 % tubers are germinated, application of paraquat dichloride 24   % SL @ 200 gram a.i./acre can be used to control broadleaf, sedges and grassy   weeds.


Resting stage of the   diseases, black heart/ scurf
Cultural control: • Tubers stored in oxygen deficient structures should not be used. Chemical control: • Treat tuber with M.E.M.C. 6% FS @ 0.415 g/ Kg tubers in 100 ml water for   3-5 minute or soaking potato seed tubers in streptocycline 40 to 100 ppm   solution for half an hour prior to planting or with carbendazim 25%+ mancozeb   50% WS @ (1.5 + 3.0) to (1.75 + 3.5) for 10 Kg seed (tuber) or with carboxin   37.5% + thiram 37.5% DS@ (1.5 + 3.0) to (1.75 + 3.5) for 10 Kg seed (tuber).



Vegetative/   seed/tuber stage




Common cultural practices: • Collect and destroy crop debris • Judicious use of fertilizers • Provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • Avoid water logging • Avoid any stress to the crop as much as possible • Enhance biocontrol activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 natural   enemies are observed. Common mechanical practices: • Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant   parts • Collect and destroy eggs and early stage larvae • Handpick the older larvae during early stages of crop • Use yellow and blue sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre • Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity   (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • Erect bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as King   crow, common mynah etc. • Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm Common biological practices: • Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • Augmentative release of natural enemies

Plant   growth regulators
• Apply mepiquat chloride 5% AS   @ 1.25-1.5 l (mix 200 -300 ml of products in 10 l of water) at 45 days after sowing to restrict the excessive vegetative growth   of potato and increasits yield • Apply gibberellic acid 0.001% L @ 180 ml in 450-500 l of water twice at   45 days after sowing and 65 days after sowing or Apply triacontanol 0.05% EC @ 0.50 l in   500-600 l of water twice at 30 and 45 days after sowing to enhance the yield

Potato virus Y, S, X
• Same as in aphid/thrips   control


Bacterial soft rot
• Follow common cultural,   mechanical and biological practices Cultural control: • Physical damage must be avoided as it encourages post harvest rots.



Harvesting



Weeds
• Prior to harvesting/ after   harvesting left over weeds should be removed before shedding of their seeds to reduce the spread of weeds.


Potato tuber moth
Cultural control: • After harvesting, potatoes should be kept in heaps in cool places for   another 10-15 days for drying and further curing of skin. Heaps 3-4 meter long, wide at   the base and about 1 meter wide at the top are the best. In hills the harvested potatoes   are spread in well-ventilated rooms for drying. • Fresh market potatoes should be stored between 5 to 6 °C. Potatoes that   are used for making chips should be stored between 7 and 10 °C. • Collection of left over tubers in the field after harvesting • Storage of healthy tubers in moth proof structures


Bacterial soft rot
Cultural control: • Physical damage must be avoided as it encourages post-harvest rots. • Before storage curing is effective and non-chemical control method can be   done by exposing tubers for 5 days at 15 – 20 °C and 90 - 95% RH.


Black heart
Cultural control: • Maintain cold storage at 4 °C or slightly higher. • Maintain proper aeration in the storage.


Note: Pesticides dosages and spray fluid volume are based on high volume   sprayer. *Apply Trichoderma viride/harzianum and Pseudomonas fluorescens for   treatment of seed tubers and soil application (if commercial products are   used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own   consumption in their fields, registration is not required). ** Pests of regional significance
