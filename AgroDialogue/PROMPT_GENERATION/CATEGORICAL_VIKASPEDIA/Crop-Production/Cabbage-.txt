Cabbage 


Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var capitata) is a small, leafy biennial producing a compact globular mass of smooth or crincled leaves wrapped over each other known as head. The outer leaves are generally larger than the inner. The stem is short and stout. Plants flower generally after winter.

Leaves are low in calories (27 per cent), fat (0.1 per cent)  and carbohydrates  (4.6 per cent).  It is good sources of  protein (1.3  per cent) which contains all essential amino acids, particularly   sulphur containing amino acids. Cabbage is an excellent source of minerals such as calcium (39 mg), iron   (0.8 mg), magnesium (10 mg), sodium (14.1 mg), potassium (114 mg) and   phosphorus (44 mg).  It has substantial  amounts of β carotene  provitamin A), ascorbic acid, riboflavin, niacin and  thiamine.   Ascorbic acid content varies  from 30-65 mg per 100 g fresh weight.

Flavour in  cabbage leaves is due to the glycoside sinigrin.  Cabbage  contains goitrogens which cause  enlargement of thyroid glands.

The major cabbage producing states are , Odisha, Bihar, Assam, , Maharashtra  and Karnataka.

Climate and soil

Cultivation of cabbage is done mainly on sandy to heavy soils rich in organic matter. Early crops prefer  light soil while late crops thrive better on heavier soils due to retention of moisture. On heavy soils,  plants grow more slowly and the keeping quality is improved. A pH range of 6.0-6.5 is considered as  optimum for growing cabbage. Plants growing in saline soils are prone to diseases.

In India, cabbage is grown in large areas having a cool and moist climate. A temperature range of 15o-21o C is considered as optimum for growth and head formation of the crop. The intensity of flowering  depends upon the age of the plants and the period for which they are exposed to low temperatures.

Varieties

Golden acre,  Pusa Drum Head, Pride of India, Copenhagen Market, Pusa Mukta, Pusa Synthetic, Midseason Market, September Early, Early Drum Head, Late Large Drum Head, K-1 are some of the varieties.

Propagation

Nursery Bed Preparation 

The seeds are generally sown in a seed bed and 4-6 week old seedlings are transplanting to the field. Cabbage seeds are sown on nursery beds to raise seedlings for transplanting in the field. Raised beds  of size 3 x 0.6 m and 10-15 cm in height are prepared. About 70cm distance is kept between two beds  to carry out intercultural operations such as watering, weeding, etc. The surface of beds should be  2 smooth and well levelled. Well-decomposed FYM @ 2-3 kg/m   is added at the time of bed preparation.  Raised beds are necessary to avoid problem of water logging in heavy soils.  To avoid mortality of  seedlings  due  to  damping  off,  drenching  of  the  beds  with  Bavistin  (15-20g/10  litres  of  water)  is   effective.

Season of Planting

Sowing  time  depends  upon  the  variety  and  the  agro-climatic  conditions  prevailing  in  a  particular   region.  Early  cabbage  is  sown  during  July-November  in  plains  and  April-August  in  hills,  as  these   require a longer period for their head formation.

Raising of Seedlings 

About 300-500g of seed are sufficient for raising nursery required to plant one hectare. Prior to sowing  seeds are treated with fungal culture of  Trichoderma viride  (4 g/ kg of seed) or Thiram (3g/ kg of seed)  to avoid damage from damping-off disease. Sowing should be done thinly in lines spaced at 5-7 cm  distance. Seeds are sown at a depth of 1-2 cm and covered with a fine layer of soil followed by light  watering by water can. The beds should then be covered with dry straw or grass or sugarcane leaves to  maintain required temperature and moisture. The watering should be done by water can as per the  need  till  germination  is  completed.  The  cover  of  dry  straw  or  grass  is  removed  immediately  after   emergence of seed sprout. If there is over crowding of seedling due to thick sowing, the extra seedlings  should be thinned out.

The seedlings should be transplanted within 4-6 weeks of sowing. Older seedlings when transplanted  result in poor growth and yield.

Planting

Land Preparation

The field is ploughed to fine tilth by giving four to five ploughing with a sufficient interval between two  ploughing. Planking should be done for proper levelling.  The transplanting is done on the flat land, ridges or in furrows depending on climate and soil conditions.  For early planting, ridge method is suitable especially in areas where the rains occur at the time of  planting. In saline soils, planting in furrows and in dry areas transplanting on flat beds is recommended.

Spacing

The planting distance may vary according to variety, planting season and soil conditions. The following  distances are generally recommended on the basis of maturity of varieties:


Early maturity varieties : 45 x 45 or 60 x 30 cm
Mid : 60 x 45 cm
Late : 60 x 60 cm or 75 x 60 cm 

Method of  Planting 

Transplanting should be done preferably in the morning or late evening. Before transplanting, the roots  of  the  seedlings  are  dipped  in  a  solution  of  Bavistin  (2g/litre  of  water).  Irrigation  should  be  given   immediately  after  transplanting.  In  some  parts  of  the  country,  beds  are  first  irrigated  and  then  the   seedlings are transplanted.

Manures and fertilizers

The fertilizer dose depends upon the fertility of soil and amount of organic manure applied to the crop.  For a good yield, 15-20 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM is incorporated into the soil about 4 weeks  before  transplanting.  Generally,  application  of  80-120  kg  N,  60-100kg  P2O5 and  60-120  kg  K2O  is recommended for optimum yield. Half the dose of N and entire amount of P and K is given at the time of  transplanting. The balance N is given six weeks after transplanting or at the time of earthing up.

Irrigation

First irrigation is given just after transplanting of seedlings and subsequent irritations are given at  an interval of 10-15 days depending upon the season and soil conditions. Care should be taken to  avoid water stress from the time of head formation to the head maturity period. At the time of crop  maturity, irrigation should be avoided as excess irrigation at this stage causes splitting of heads.

Intercultural Operations

Normally,  the  crop  is  kept  free  of  weeds  by  2-3  hand  weedings  and  1-2  hoeings.  Pre-emergence   application of Fluchloralin (1-2 litres a.i. in 600-700 litres of water) or Nitrofen (2kg a.i./ha) followed by a  hand  weeding  60  days  after  transplanting  effectively  checks  the  weed  population.  If  necessary,   earthing up is done 30 days after transplanting. At the time of earthing up the plants are supported with  soil to avoid toppling of the plant during head formation.

Harvesting and Yield

Cabbage is ready for harvest at 90-120 days after planting. Cabbage should be harvested  promptly when the heads are firm and mature. Delaying harvest, even a few days beyond maturity  can result in split heads and increased incidence of field disease.

Harvesting immature heads, however, reduces yield, and the heads are too soft to resist handling  damage. Immature heads also have a shorter shelf life than mature heads.

The head is harvested by bending it to one side and cutting it with a knife. The stalk should be cut  flat and as close to the head as possible, yet long enough to retain two to four wrapper leaves.  Extra leaves act as cushions during handling and may be desired in certain markets. The head  should not be removed by snapping or twisting it since this practice damages the head and results  in inconsistent stalk length. Broken stalks are also more susceptible to decay. As the heads are not  ready for harvest at the same time, therefore they are harvested in stages based on the maturity of  the heads.

Harvested produce should always be stored in shade before packing.

Yield

Yield of the cabbage varies greatly depending upon variety, maturity group and season of cultivation. Average yield obtained from early varieties is 25-30 t/ha and that of late type is 40-60 t/ha.
