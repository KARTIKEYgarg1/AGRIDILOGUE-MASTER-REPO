Chill Crop stage wise IPM






Management


Activity




Nutrients



Add well rotten farm yard manure (FYM) @ 25   t/acre or vermicompost @ 4 t/acre. Incorporate at the time of field   preparation 1 week (vermicompost) or 2 to 3 weeks (FYM) before transplanting





Weeds



At the time of field preparation, adopt stale   seed bed technique to minimize the weeds menace in field 
Keep the nursery weed free by hand weeding





Soil borne fungus, nematodes, and resting stages of insects


Cultural control:

Deep summer ploughing of fields to control   nematodes, Helicoverpa, and Spodoptera. 
Soil solarization: Cover the beds with   polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing   for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil borne pests 

Biological control:

Apply neem cake @ 100 kg/acre at the time of   transplanting for reducing nematodes and borer damage. 

Chemical control:

In nematode severe area apply carbofuran 3% CG   granules @ 26,640 g/acre





Damping off


Cultural control: 

Excessive watering and poorly drained areas of   field should be avoided 
Use raised beds: more than 15 cm height is   better for water drainage. 
Raise seedlings in pro-trays/plug trays. 

Chemical control: 

Seed treatment with captan 75 WS @ 25- 30 g/kg   seed 
Soil drenching with captan 75% WP @ 1000 g in   400 l of water/acre or





Seed Sowing/ Transplanting stage




Nutrients



Before sowing, soil testing should be done to   find out the soil fertility status. Nutrient should be provided as per soil   test recommendations. Generally, for rainfed chilli: 60: 30: 50: Kg N: P:   Kg/ha should be applied as basal dose. For irrigated chilli: 60: 60: 30 Kg N:   P: K/ha should be applied as a basal dose.
Based on soil test for micronutrient, the   deficient micronutrient should be applied in soil at sowing / transplanting.   In Zn deficient areas, zinc sulphate @ 25 kg/acre should be applied at last   ploughing.
Biofertilizers: For seed treatment with   Azotobacter and phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (PSB) cultures @ 8-10 g/kg   seed 
For seedling root dip treatment with   Azotobacter and phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (PSB) cultures @ 250 g/acre   seedlings





Weeds



Keep the nursery weed free by hand weeding





Vegetative stage




Nutrients



In rainfed chilli, apply 25 kg N/acre as top   dressing with rains. 
In irrigated chilli, first top dressing of 20   kg N + 10 kg K/acre should be done at 45 days after planting. 
Second top dressing of 20 kg N + 10 kg K/acre   should be done at 60 days after planting. 
Third top dressing of 20 kg N + 10 kg K/acre   should be done at 75 days after planting. 
Micronutrient deficiency should be corrected   by foliar spray of particular micronutrient. 
Apply NAA @ 50 ppm (1 ml in 4.5 lit of water )   2-3 times at 15 days interval to minimize flower drop





Weeds



Field should be weed free up to 30 days to   enable the crop to cover up. 
After transplanting 2 hand weedings are required.
