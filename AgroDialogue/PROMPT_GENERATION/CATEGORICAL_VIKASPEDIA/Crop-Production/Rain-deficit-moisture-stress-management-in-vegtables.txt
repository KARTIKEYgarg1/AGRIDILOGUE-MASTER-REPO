Production  strategies 


Use of organic mulch such as paddy straw, dry grass, etc @ 7 - 10 tones/ha 
Use  of  organic  manures  (FYM  15  tones/ha  or  vermicompost  10  tones/ha)  to  enhance  water holding capacity of soil 
Ensure life saving irrigation at least during critical growth stages such as active growth,  flowering  and  fruit  enlargement.  If  there  is  water  shortage,  alternate  furrow  irrigation  should be practice 
Do not allow weeds to grow during plant’s early growth stage 
Perform tillage operations only in upper 5cm soil layer . Plant protection strategies Sucking insect pest viz. jassids, whitefly, Aphids, thrips, mites, etc may be a major problem.  In  drought  condition,  chance  of  occurrence  of  diseases  in  vegetables  is  less  (except  viral  diseases). 

For management of sucking  pests,  the following strategies may be followed:


Seed treatment with imidacloprid or Thiomethoxam @ 3 - 5gm/kg seed 
Foliar  spray  of  imidacloprid  17.852  @  0.55  ml/L,  Thiomethoxam  25  wG  @    0.35g/L  or  Thiocloprid 21.7 SC @ 0.65ml/L. 
For mites  - Abametin @ 0.5 ml/L,Spiromesifer @1 ml/L, Chlorofenpyr @1ml/L, Poersite  2 - 3 ml/L or Fenzaquin @2 ml/L 
Botanical insecticides - Neem based insecticide @ 5 ml/L 
Bio - agents - Verticellium lecani - 5 g/L. 
For Mealy bugs - Chlorpyriphos 20EC @ 2 ml/L or Imidacloprid @ 05 ml/L.
For   sporadic   incidence   of   Lepidopteran   pest   (Caterpillar) - Indoxacorb   0.5   ml/L,  Emamectin benzoate @ 0.35 gm/L or Flubendamide @ 0.5 ml/L 

Under erratic/ unpredictable/inconsistent/ irregular rainfall

Production strategies


Grow crop on ridge - furrow (25 - 30 cm high) or furrow irrigated raised bed (90 cm wide  and 20 cm high) planting system to avoid water logging situation
Grow  vegetable  crops  and  varieties  that  can  sustained  both  under  scanty  and  heavy  rainfall condition as suggested in table above 
Train cucurbit vegetables over bower system
Ensure life saving irrigation at least during critical growth stages such as active growth,  flowering and fruit enlargement.
Do not allow weeds to grow during plant’s early growth stage. 

Onion

In onion only  kharif  crop (20 % area) is rain-fed.  Rabi onion, which is the main crop (60%  area) and late  kharif (20% area) are grown as irrigated crops. Thus, drought/rainfall deficit  has  relevance  mainly  to  kharif crop.  Kharif  crop  of  onion  is  grown  mainly  in Maharashtra,  Karnataka, Gujarat and some parts of Rajasthan.

If monsoon delayed by 15 days : 

This may not have much effect on the  kharif onion as this  crop can be transplanted from July to August. The nursery raising will be rather easier, as  onion  seedlings  are  difficult   to  be   raised  under  rains.    The   following  strategies  are  suggested in this situation.


Varieties  having  wider  adaptability  (suitable  for  kharf as  well  as  late  kharif )  namely  Bhima Super, Bhima Raj, Bhima Red, Bhima Shubra, Agrifound Dark Red, Arka Kalyan,  Arka Pragati, Baswant 780 and Phule Samarth may be grown. 
Nursery  may  be  raised  during  second  week  of  June  in  such  a  way  that  seedling  of  about 35 - 50 days could be transplanted. 
Raise seedlings on a raised bed with drip or micro sprinkler irrigation syst em to use  available  irrigation  water  judiciously.  In  case,  drip  irrigation  facility  is  not  available,  apply irrigation water through water sprinkler cans. 
Minimum three to four irrigations need to be given in nursery. 
Seedlings should be protected by prov iding partial shade nets. 
Apply stubble mulch (paddy straw) until seed germination to avoid evaporation. 
Apply well decomposed organic manures @ 0.5t / 1000 sq m.  8. In case of poor seedling growth, foliar application of water soluble NPK fertilizer (for  exa mple 5g/liter 19:19:19 NPK) may be given for quick recovery. 

If monsoon delayed by 30 days


The strategies as listed above should be followed. 
The other alternative can be to go for direct seeding of onion (Seed rate 8 - 9 kg/ha) on  raised  bed  with  drip  or  sprinkler  irrigation  system  as  this  crop  matures  1  month  earlier than the seedling transplanted crop. 
Use  sets  if  available  for  raising  kharif crop  as  this  crop  matures  45  days  earlier  than  the seedling transplanted crop. 

Rain deficit at vegetative phase 

Three  to  four  irrigations  are  essential  during  active  vegetative  growth  stage  depending  upon soil type i. e. at establishment stage (10 - 20 DAT), active vegetative growth stage (30 - 40  DAT)  and  bulb  initiation  stage  (40 - 50  DAT).  To  cope  up  with  rain  deficit  at  this  stage  the following advisory may work.


Raise crop on raised beds with drip irrigation. 
Harvest rain water by  making storage ponds  which will  help to provide two to three  life  saving  irrigations  during  drought.  Irrigation  water  should  be  applied  as  per  soil  moisture level and crop requirement only. 
Spray anti - transparent Kaolinite @ 5% to reduce water loss through transpiration as  per requirement. 
Cover soil surface with organic mulch such as paddy/wheat straw, or fodder to reduce  evaporation. 
In  case  of  poor  crop  growth,  foliar  application  of  water  soluble  NPK  fertilizer  (for  example 5g/liter 19:19:19 NPK) may be given for quick recovery. 
Foliar  application  of  sulphur  85%  WP  @  1.5 - 2.0  g/liter  for  quick  recovery  during  active vegetative growth stage. 
Foliar application of micronutrient mixture containing Zn, Mn, Fe, Cu, B at 30, 45 and  60 DAT for better crop stand (5 ml/liter). 
Well  decomposed organic  manures  equivalent  to  20  t FYM/ha  may be  applied 15 - 30  days before transplanting. 
During dry spell, thrips population may increase above economic threshold level (30  thrips/plant), in that case spray Profenophos 1ml/L or Carbosulfan 2ml/L or Fipronil  @ 1.5ml/l for ef fective management. 

Rain Deficit at reproductive stage  - Reproductive phase in onion does n ot occur  during  kharif season.

Terminal drought - One irrigation is sufficient at 85 days after transplanting. That may  be provided by drip irrigation using harvested rain water.

Note:  The  above  strategies  can  also  be  followed  for  late  kharif and  rabi  crops  in  case  of  deficiency of irrigation water.
