Apple: Crop Stage-wise IPM



  


Management
Activity



Pre planting*



Nutrients
•   Pits of 1 meter cube are dug in square system during summer season and kept   open for controlling soil born pests. • Soils of different horizons should be analysed to know the inherent   fertility and soil condition of the field. • The fertilizer dose should be based upon soil fertility, type of soil,   kind and age of trees, cultural practices, climate and crop load. • Application of manures and fertilizers start right from planting of an   orchard at the time of filling of pits. • In an orchard of optimal fertility, N, P and K may be applied in the   ratio 70: 30: 70 g/year/tree.


Weeds
· Deep ploughing followed by cross harrowing the field before   planting to destroy existing weeds in the field.



Planting*



Nutrients
•   Pits should be filled with a mixture of pond silt, red soil and farmyard   manure. • Two-three kilos of bone meal or super phosphate per pit should be   applied.


Weeds
·  Adopt intercropping and recommended agronomic practices.


Pests, nematode, soil borne pathogens and other diseases
•   Grow resistant/tolerant varieties viz.,: Emra, Red Free, Ambstraking,   Ambroyal, Ambrich and Ambred in the endemic areas for controlling scab and   Maharaji Chunth and Golden Chinese (apple cultivars),Yantarka Altaskya,   Dolgoe (crab apple cultivars) for controlling powdery mildew disease


Scab and   powdery mildew
•   Use healthy infestation-free plants. • Aphids usually spread through infested stocks, avoid planting infested   stocks.


Woolly apple   aphid
•   Use resistant root-stocks belonging to Malling Merton series. • Ecological engineering with buckwheat attracts parasitoid, Aphelinus   mali



Vegetative stage 1st   year onwards



Nutrients
•   The dose should be stabilized (700: 350: 700 g N: P: K/tree) after 10 years   of age. These applications may be supplemented with FYM @10 Kg per tree in   the first year and increase as the age of the tree with a maximum of 100   Kg. • In off years, the fertilizer dose of NPK may be reduced to 500 g, 250 g   and 400 g, respectively. In bearing trees, FYM along with P and K should be   applied during December-January. Nitrogen is applied during February-March, 2   to 3 weeks before bud break. The Nitrogen can be applied in two split doses,   first dose 2-3 weeks before bud break and the second one, one month after   flowering. • The fertilizers should be broadcasted in the tree basins 30 cm away from   the tree trunk up to the canopy drip line and mixed well in the soil.


Weeds
Cultural   control: • Regular weeding should be done in the tree basin. • Regular mowing of weeds between tree rows should be done to check the   weeds. • Ploughing between tree rows. Chemical control: • Apply paraquat dichloride 24% SL @ 1300 ml in 280-400 l of water/acre as   post-emergence and direct between rows at 2-3 leaf stage of weeds to control   grasses and broad-leaved weeds in the orchards.


White   rot/root rot**
Chemical   control: • For root rot, make 5-10 trunk injections @ 2 g/tree



Reproductive



Nutrients
•   In case of any nutritional deficiency observed at flowering and fruiting, it   should be corrected immediately by foliar application of that particular   nutrient.


Weeds
• Keep the orchard   weed free by adopting cultural practices as stated in vegetative stage.

Scab
Cultural   control: • Clean cultivation, collection and destruction of fallen leaves and pruned   materials in winter to prevent the sexual cycle. • Collect and burn the infected plant debris • Follow proper trimming and pruning of twigs and branches followed by   burning. • Apply urea (2 Kg/acre at pre-leaf fall stage spring and dolomitic lime   (2.5 ton/acre) in autumn over fallen leaves to accelerate   decomposition.

Note: The pesticide dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on high volume spray.

* Apply Trichoderma spp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens as root stock/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).
