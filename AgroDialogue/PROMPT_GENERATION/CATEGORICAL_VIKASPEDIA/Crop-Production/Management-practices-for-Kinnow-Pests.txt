Management practices for Kinnow Pests


General management tips


As precautionary measure first spray may be given as soon as the new flush is emerged.
Destroy the ant colonies in the orchards as they are the carriers of certain pests to their feeding sites and also protect them from other harmful agencies.
Close spacing and water logging conditions should be avoided in the orchards which help in creating micro niche favouring the pest population.
Avoid pruning during active growth periods as it induces irregular and frequent flushes which lead to the perpetuation of pest. If necessary, prune only the infested dry shoots after fruit harvest.
Apply nitrogenous fertilizers as per need only as excessive and frequent applications promote new flushes which provide favourable conditions for insect pests' infestation.
Modify canopy structure in such a way that light interception is maximum below the canopy.
Preparations of spray solution, spraying operations, insecticide residue and compatibility in mixtures are important aspects to keep in mind before undertaking the sprays.
The time of insecticide application should be decided after monitoring the pest incidence meticulously viz., only young and vulnerable life stages of the pest should be sprayed upon.
The spray should be targeted on the lower surface of the leaves and the new flush. Canopy should be covered till the run off stage.
Avoid the repeat application of a particular pesticide and do not use expired pesticide.
Prepare spray solution first in small quantity and then increase the volume to desired level by adding water. In case of wettable power take required quantity of pesticide, add a little quantity of water, mix it thoroughly to prepare the paste and then add remaining quantity of water to this paste with constant stirring.
Avoid spraying during strong winds, cloudy days and drizzling.

Seasonal management practices




February - March

Citrus psylla occurrence starts after fruit harvesting at bud swelling stage in the end of February of begining of March. Look for the pest on the border trees, If found, infested initiate spraying of Lecanicillium lecanii (1*10 conidia/ml) of dimethoate 30 EC @ 25 ml/ 10 lit. of water. It gives good management of early (1st and 2nd) instar nymphs of citrus psylla.
In the month of March, If the occurrence of the pest is still observed, spray imidacloprid 17.8 SL (4 ml/10lit.water), 8 days after dimethoate for the management of citrus psylla, leaf miner and aphids, if need be. If required, spray thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 3 g/ 10 lit. water, 10 days after application of imidacloprid.

April (After fruit set)

Erect yellow sticky traps @ 10 per ha. If the incidence of whitefly is observed (under surface of leaves) and its population is more than 5-10/ trap/week and also 5 per cent of the trees are found infested, initiate spray of triazophos 40 EC @ 25ml/10 lit. water, 8-10 days after triazophos application if there is still attack of whitefly. Spray mixture of Aureofungin/Bavistin + 2,4-D @ 0.4g/10 g +0.1 g/ 10 lit. water for the management of fruit drop. Use GA3 instead of 2,4-D when cotton or other broad leaved crop is cultivated in or aroung thye orchard.
If infestation of Phytophthora is observed, spray Aliette 80 WP @ 25g/10 lit. water.

May - June

If the incidence of whitefly still persists, spray triazophos 40 EC @ 25ml/10 lit water.
Bavistin 50 WP @ 10 ml/ 10 lit. for the management of fruit drop, if needed.

Whitefly, mite, Fruit drop


July - August
During this period, the population of psylla or leaf miner or white fly starts reinfesting the trees. To manage these pests, spray thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 3 g/ 10 lit of water and triazophos 40 EC @ 25ml/ 10 lit or water Spray mixture of 2, 4-D + Tilt 25 EC @ 0.1 + 10 gm/ 10 lit. water for the management of fruit drop. Spray Bavistin 50 WP @ 10g/ 10 Iit. water, 2 weeks after application of 2,4-D

September

If the whitefly damage still persists and sooty mould is observed, spray mixture of triazophos 40 EC + ziram 80 WP @ 25 ml +25 ml/ 10 lit. water Clear the infested branches of the fross and faeces and inject 5-10 ml of dichlorvos (1%) in to the tunnel and cover it with cotton wad reduces the bark eating caterpillar infestation
If the incidence of Phytophthora is observed, spray Aliette 80 WP @ 25g/ 10 lit. water. Spray Roko 70 WP @ 10 g/ 10 lit. water for the management of fruit drop in end September

October

If the spraying of Triazophos was given in September, citrus psylla will not reapper but if observed, spray thaimethoxam 25 WG @ 3 g/ 10 lit. water. Destroy the fallen fruits by burrying in the ground, generation of smoke in the late evening hours and fliar application of neem oil (1%) or malathion 50EC @ 2ml/l reduces the fruit sucking moth incidence.
For the management of Canker/ Scab, spray mixture of Streptocycline + Copper oxychloride/hydroxide @ 1 gm + 25 g/ 10 lit. water.
