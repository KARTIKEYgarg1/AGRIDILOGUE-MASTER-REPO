Animal Pandemic Preparedness Initiative

Animal Pandemic Preparedness Initiative was launched during April 2023 to enhance India's preparedness and response to potential animal pandemics, as part of the National One Health Mission. 

National One Health Mission

One Health is an integrating idea that brings different sectors together to solve the health, productivity, and conservation challenges and has major implications for India. India with its diverse wildlife, one of the largest livestock populations and high density of human population, carries heightened risks for inter-compartmental spread of diseases

The Mission aims to coordinate across achieving overall pandemic preparedness and integrated disease control against priority diseases of both human and animal sectors, with early warning systems built on integrated surveillance system and response readiness for endemic as well as emerging epidemic or pandemic threat.  

The mission will also address critical pillars of preparedness in the form of targeted R&D to develop important tools such as vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics, readiness in terms of clinical care, streamline data and information linkages and access across sectors as well as close community participation to keep our readiness to respond.  



Aim of APPI

The initiative aims to enhance India's preparedness and response to animal pandemics, with a focus on zoonotic diseases that pose a threat to both animal and human health. This initiative will help to improve veterinary services and infrastructure, disease surveillance capabilities, early detection and response, build the capacity of animal health professionals, and awareness among farmers through community outreach.

Components of APPI

Animal Pandemic Preparedness Initiative covers all aspects of disease prevention, control and pandemic preparedness comprehensively. The key elements include Integrated disease surveillance & monitoring, early warning & response, Vaccine/ diagnostics, R&D and production, and ecosystem coordination with funding and regulatory framework enablers.
