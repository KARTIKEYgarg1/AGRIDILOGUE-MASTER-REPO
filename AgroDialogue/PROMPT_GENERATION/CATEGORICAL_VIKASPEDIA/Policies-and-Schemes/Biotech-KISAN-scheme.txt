Biotech-KISAN scheme


Biotech-Krishi Innovation Science Application Network (Biotech-KISAN) is a Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology initiative that empowers farmers, especially women farmers. It aims to understand the problems of water, soil, seed and market faced by the farmers and provide simple solutions to them.

The Scheme is for farmers, developed by and with farmers, it empowers women, impacts locally, connects globally, is Pan-India, has a hub-and spoke model and stimulates entrepreneurship and innovation in farmers.

Objectives and Scope of coverage

Biotech-Krishi    Innovation    Science    Application    Network    (Biotech-KISAN) is being implemented in 15 agro-climatic zones of India in phased manner with the following objectives:


Linking available science and technology  to the farm by first understanding the problem of  the local farmer and provide solutions to  those problems.
The  working  together,  in  close  conjunction,  of  scientists  and  farmers  is  the  only  way  to  improve the working conditions of small and marginal farmers. 
This  programme  aims  to  work  with  small  and  marginal  farmers  especially  the  woman  farmer  for  better  agriculture  productivity through  scientific  intervention and evolving best  farming practices in the Indian context 

Salient features


For Farmers: The Biotech-KISAN is a Farmer centric scheme launched by of the Department of Biotechnology, where scientists will work in sync with farmers to understand problems and find solutions. 
By Farmers: Developed in consultation with the farmers.  Soil, Water, Seed and Market are some key points that concern small and marginal farmers. Biotech-KISAN aims to link farmers, scientists and science institutions across the country in a network that identifies and helps solve their problems in a cooperative manner. 
Empower women. The woman farmer is often neglected. It is important to empower the women farmer, help her meet her concerns for better seed, storage of seed and protection of the crops from disease and pest. The women farmer is also the prime caretaker of livestock and she is eager to combine traditional wisdom in handling the livestock and with current best practices, especially in the context of emerging livestock disease. The scheme includes the Mahila Biotech- KISAN fellowships, for training and education in farm practices, for women farmers.  The Scheme also aims to support the women farmers/ entrepreneur in their small enterprises, making her a grass root innovator.
Connects Globally. Biotech-KISAN will connect farmers to best global practices; training workshops will be held in India and other countries. Farmers and Scientists will partner across the globe.
Impacts Locally. The scheme is targeted towards the least educated marginalised farmer; Scientists will spend time on farms and link communication tools to soil, water seed and market. The aim is to understand individual problems of the smallholding farmers and provide ready solutions. 
Across India. Biotech KISAN will connect farmers with science in the 15 agro-climatic zones of the country in a manner, which constantly links problems with available solutions. 
Hubs and Spoke. In each of these 15 regions, a Farmer organisation will be the hub connected to different science labs, Krishi Vigyan Kendra and State Agriculture Universities co-located in the region. The hub will reach out to the farmers in the region and connect them to scientists and institutions. 
Farmers as Innovators. The hub will have tinkering lab, communication cell and will run year-long training, awareness, workshops and which will act as education demonstration units to encourage grass root innovation in the young as well as women farmers. 
Communicating Best Practices There will be a communication set-up to make radio and TV programmes for local stations, as well as daily connectivity through social media.

Components of the programme

The  Programme will provide support  for following three components:


The  Hub :  Establishment of  Biotech - KISAN  Hub  in  each  of  15  agro-climatic  zones  of  the  country  under  the  leadership  of  a  champion,  who  will  act  as  a  Facilitator.  Each  Hub  will  create  a  network  by  developing  strong  linkages  with  top  quality  scientific  institutions  /  State  Agri cultural   Universities   (SAUs)   /   Krishi   Vigyan   Kendras   (KVKs)   /   existing   state  agriculture extension services / system and other Farmers’ organizations in the region as  well  as  linkages  with  leading  international  institutions  /  organizations.  Biotech-KISAN  Hub  will have a tinkering laboratory. The Hub  will  get  financial  assistance  for  initially  2  years  of  Rs  60  lakhs  per  year  and  on  the basis of a review for additional 3 years
Partnering Institutes: The activities of the partnering institute will include:

Conduct training  programmes  for  farmers  in  laboratories  of  scientific  research institutions.
Training programmes for scientists in agricultural farms
Budget  for  each  collaborating  institution  /  KVKs  etc. is Rs 5.00 lakhs per year for each specific activity as defined in the application.


Research projects: If  scientists  during  the  course  of  these  programmes  identify  a  problem,  which would  require  larger  funding; it  would  be  possible  for  them  to  submit  the  research  project proposal to  the  Programme for  additional  funding.  The  proposal  will  be  considered  by  the  relevant  Expert  Committee  /  Task  Force  of  the  Programme and based on the genesis of the project and the solution hypothesised, additional funds  may be provided.
International Training: Short - term  Training (STT) Programmes will be developed by DBT in partnership with  international  organisations / universities,  where  Farmers  will  be  exposed  to  best  global farm management and practices. Depending  on  the  activities  carried  out  by  scientists/farmers  in  India;  selected  groups  will  be  sponsored  by  DBT  for  international  STT.  The  current  collaborating  universities  are Cambridge  University, UK; Wageningen University, Netherlands  and  others are likely to be added.
