National Programme for Bovine Breeding and Dairy Development


The NPBBDD has been formulated by merging four ongoing schemes of the  Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries in the dairy  sector. These are the National Project for Cattle and Buffalo Breeding  (NPCBB), Intensive Dairy Development Programme (IDDP), Strengthening  Infrastructure for Quality and Clean Milk Production (SIQ and CMP) and  assistance to cooperatives. This has been done to integrate milk  production and dairying activities in a scientific and holistic manner  for attaining higher levels of milk production and productivity, to meet  the increasing demand for milk in the country.

Components of the scheme

National Programme for Bovine Breeding and Dairy Development (NPBBDD) has the following three components.


National Programme for Bovine Breeding (NPBB)
National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) and 
Rashtriya Gokul Mission.

Component-wise objectives of the scheme

National Programme for Bovine Breeding


To arrange quality Artificial Insemination services at farmers' doorstep
To bring all breedable females under organized breeding through Artificial Insemination or natural service using germplasm of high genetic merits
To conserve, develop and proliferate selected indigenous bovine breeds of high socio-economic importance
To provide quality breeding inputs in breeding tracts of important indigenous breeds so as to prevent the breeds from deterioration and extinction

National Programme for Dairy Development


To create and strengthen infrastructure for production of quality milk including cold chain infrastructure linking the farmer to the consumer
To create and strengthen infrastructure for procurement, processing and marketing of milk and milk products
To create training infrastructure for training of dairy farmers
To strengthen dairy cooperative societies/Producers Companies at village level
To increase milk production by providing technical input services like cattle-feed, and mineral mixture etc

Rashtriya Gokul Mission


To undertake breed improvement programme for indigenous cattle breeds so as to improve the genetic makeup and increase the stock.
To enhance milk production and productivity of indigenous bovines.
To upgrade nondescript cattle using elite indigenous breeds like Gir, Sahiwal, Rathi, Deoni, Tharparkar, Red Sindhi. 
To distribute disease free high genetic merit bulls of indigenous breeds for natural service.
