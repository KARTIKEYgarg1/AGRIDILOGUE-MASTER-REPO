National Certification System for Tissue Culture Raised Plants


National Certification System for Tissue Culture Raised Plants (NCS-TCP) is a unique quality management system established by Department of  Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of India, under the "Seeds Act, 1966" of the  Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare for ensuring production and distribution of  quality tissue culture planting materials. It is being implemented by Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of  India since year 2006, as per the Gazette of India Notification under  the Seeds Act. 1966.

Tissue culture production  facilities get recognition under this quality management system based on  compliance with technical capabilities, infrastructure, package of  practices and documentation/ record keeping. Once the tissue culture  production facility is recognized they become eligible to get their  tissue culture raised planting material certified from Accredited Test Laboratories (ATLs). The  certified batches of tissue culture raised plants are provided with  certification labels enabled with barcode. This barcode provide end  users to trace back history of plants from where the tissue culture  raised planting material are derived.
