Jute Raw Material Bank Scheme


Background

National  Jute  Board (NJB), Ministry  of  Textiles,  Govt.  of  India  has  developed  large  numbers  of  clusters  of  Women  Self  Help  Groups  (WSHGs),  artisans  and  entrepreneurs throughout the  country  engaged  in  manufacturing of  various types  of  Jute  Diversified  Products  (JDPs )  ranging  from  ordinary  shopping/fancy  bags,  braided  handicrafts,  handloom  products,  jute  footwear,  jute  wall  hangings,  floor  coverings  etc.  through  trainings,  design  development  &  disseminations and supplying machines. Now, there is an urgent need of establishing jute raw  material supply chains for ensuring uninterrupted supply of jute raw materials for making jute  products  by  these  beneficiaries. With  a  view  to  this, the setting  up  of  Jute  Raw  Materials  Bank  near those clusters and production units has become inevitable.

Objectives



The following objectives are envisaged for the JRMB Schemes


To assist more and more number of production units in the small, medium and micro  sector  for  use  of  jute as  raw  material  in  order  to  expand  the  production  base  for  the  diversified jute products. 
To  assist  by  providing  jute  raw  materials  at  their  locations  to  the  number  of  existing  skilled workforce as well as the new artisans/entrepreneurs/WSHGs for production of  jute diversified products in the decentralized sector.
To  help  create  employment  for  the  rural  masses  in  the  newly  established  JDP  production units. 
To  increase  demand  for  consumption  of  raw  jute  for  producing  JDPs,  thereby  ensuring continuous market for the produce of jute farmers.
To build up supply  chains for certain and smooth supply of jute raw materials to the  production units in the small, medium and micro sector at an economic price at which  the materials are available at the source of supply.

Area of Operation of the Scheme

The Scheme will be implemented in the whole of India for Indian citizens wherever the scope  of  undertaking  JDPs  activities  is  existing / potential  as  per  the  available  records / survey  reports or the surveys to be conducted in future.

Activities of a JRMB


The  JRMBs  shall  be  established  near  the  clusters  and  the  production  units  so  that  jute  raw  material  is  supplied  to  them  regularly  at  economic  rates  i.e.  mill  gate  price  plus  actual  transportation  cost,  to  help  them  manufacture  high  value  products,  both for domestic  and  international  markets.  This  will  be  a  sustainable  process  to  increase  the  production  base  for  JDPs  and  to  increase  the  employments  in  rural  masses  particularly  the  women  for  which  competent  organizations /agencies having  well  established backward  and  forward  linkages  will  be  required  to  be  collaborated  with. 
Different  agencies, referred  to  as  Operating  Agencies  (OA) will be engaged by inviting applications to run each of the JRMB. 
To  survey and identify the existing  as well as the potential  clusters, where JDPs activities  can be undertaken for production of JDPs through WSHGs/Artisan s/Entrepreneurs etc. on  sustainable basis;
To  create  awareness  among  the  targeted  beneficiaries  about  the  JDPs,  their  applications  and utilities; 
To  assess  the requirements  of  jute  materials  by  the  WSHGs/Artisans/Entrepreneurs  etc.   for manufacturing JDPs as per the market trend demand; 
To  undertake  regular updating  of  jute  production  units  such  as  WSHGs,  artisans,  entrepreneurs in their respective areas and maintain a data base for the same; 
To  tie  up  and  pursue  with  Operating Agencies  of  NJB  i.e.  JIDCs  for  the  present  and  JSCs/CDAs of the past to get detailed data of the JDPs production units assisted by them;
To  encourage  and  support  WSHGs /artisans/entrepreneurs  etc. for  bulk  production  of  quality JDPs through regular supply  of required quality and quantity of jute raw materials  at economic rates as per the mechanism to be devised in consultation with NJB;
