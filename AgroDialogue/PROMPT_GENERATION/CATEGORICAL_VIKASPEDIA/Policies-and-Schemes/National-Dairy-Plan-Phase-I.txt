National Dairy Plan Phase I


National  Dairy Plan Phase I (NDP I) is a Central Sector Scheme being implemented by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB)through End Implementing Agencies (EIA)for a period of  2011-12 to 2018-19.

Objectives

​NDP I is a scientifically planned multi-state initiative with the following Project Development Objectives :


To help increase productivity of milch animals and thereby increase milk production to meet the rapidly growing demand for milk.
To help provide rural milk producers with greater access to the organised milk-processing sector.

Components and sub components

A. Productivity Enhancement  ​

This component aims at increasing bovine productivity through a scientific approach to animal breeding and nutrition.  The main expected results from the interventions proposed under Component A are increased milk production through increased productivity per milk animal, increase in in-milk animals, improved AI conception rates, improved animal nutrition, reduction in feeding costs per Kg of milk produced and reduction in methane release per Kg of milk produced by animals covered under Ration Balancing Program (RBP). The various sub-components under this component are:

a)  Production of high genetic merit (HGM) cattle and buffalo bulls and import of Jersey/ HF Bulls for semen production


Progeny testing
Pedigree Selection 
Import of bulls (equivalent embryos)

b)  Strengthening existing semen stations / starting new stations for producing high quality disease free semen doses


Strengthening existing semen stations - (A &amp; B grade semen stations only)
New Semen stations 

c)  Setting up a pilot model for viable doorstep AI delivery services (based on Standard Operating Procedures [SOPs]) through a professional service provider including animal tagging and performance record

d)    Improving nutrition of milch animals to produce milk commensurate with their genetic potential and for reducing methane emission


Ration Balancing Program- Extension advice would be provided to dairy farmers through trained Local Resource Persons (LRP) on balanced feeding with local feed resources &amp; area specific mineral mixture
Fodder Development- Extension initiatives/interventions for fodder development, including support for improved fodder seed production, fodder production on contract, demonstrations for silage making, and reducing wastage of dry fodder through enrichment &amp; densification

B. Village based milk procurement systems for weighing, testing quality of milk received and making payment to milk producers 

Efforts to increase milk production through increase in productivity would need to be supported by expanding the setting up of village based milk procurement systems to collect milk in a fair and transparent manner and ensure timely payments.      Investments in village level infrastructure for milk collection and bulking such as milk cans, bulk milk coolers for a cluster of villages, associated weighing and testing equipment and related IT equipment would be made.      The main expected results from the interventions proposed under this initiative are an increase in the number of additional villages covered and more milk producers organised into Dairy Cooperative Societies and Milk Producer Institutions. The various sub-components under this component are:

a)  Milk weighing, testing and collection

b)  Milk cooling

c)  Support for creating institutional structure

d)  Training

C. Project Management and Learning 

The main expected results under Component C are effective coordination of project activities among various EIAs, timely preparation and implementation of annual plans, regular review and reporting of project progress and results, a comprehensive and functional project management information system (MIS) and learning that will support improvement and innovation.  Importantly, it will also facilitate the development of the skills and knowledge of personnel involved in the implementation of the project and develops capabilities for enhanced capacity building which would extend beyond the life of the project. The various subcomponents under this component are:

a) ICT Based MIS- Support for the operations and management of computerised information systems for collection of data and dissemination of information related to breeding, nutrition and village based milk procurement systems.  The project envisages providing funding support to EIAs for acquiring the relevant hardware and software for each component/ sub-component.  In addition, the project would also support funding EIAs for specific application software that will enable transmission of aggregate data/ information required by the Project Management Unit located in NDDB (PMU) for overall monitoring and reporting.

b) Learning & Evaluation- Support to PMU for appropriate computer hardware and application software to create a centralised database that will store and analyse aggregate data/ information transmitted by EIAs to the PMU on breeding, nutrition, and village based milk procurement systems.  The PMU will engage the services of external agencies for carrying out baseline, mid-term and project completion surveys and other special surveys/studies as may be needed during project implementation.  Some pilots studies to experiment with potential innovations based on emerging needs may also be required.

Project Area

NDP-I is being implemented in the 18 major milk producing States of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana (after bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh), Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Kerala constituting 90% of the milk production, having 87 per cent of breedable cattle and buffalo population and 98 per cent of the fodder resources.

Coverage of NDP I  will however be across the country in terms of benefits accruing from  the scheme.

End Implementation Agencies (EIAs)

​The  project is being implemented directly through EIAs that meet the  eligibility criteria in states that have either already undertaken the  key policy/ regulatory measures to create a more enabling state level  policy environment for activities to be supported under NDP I or have  conveyed that they will do so within a stipulated time line.

The EIAs  would be State Cooperative Dairy Federations; District Cooperative Milk  Producers Unions; Cooperative form of enterprises such as Producer  Companies; State Livestock Development Boards; Central Cattle Breeding  Farms (CCBF), Central Frozen Semen Production and Training Institute  (CFSP&TI), Regional Stations for Forage Production and Demonstration  (RSFP&D); Registered Societies/ Trusts (NGOs); Section 25  Companies, subsidiaries of statutory bodies, ICAR Institutes and  Veterinary/ Dairy Institutes/Universities that meet the eligibility  criteria for each activity as may be decided by the National Steering  Committee (NSC).

Category of EIAs eligible for various activities under NDP I are listed in the table below:
