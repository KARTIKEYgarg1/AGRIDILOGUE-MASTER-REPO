Scheme for Promotion of oil palm in India


Scope for  Oil Palm cultivation

Oil palm crop is one of the highest oil (palm oil) yielding crops among the all perennial  crops.  Oil  palm  tree  produces  edible  palm-oil  as  well  as  palm  kernel-oil.  This  oil  palm  is  considered as golden palm due to its high yielding capacity. Oil palm produces  4 to 5 tonnes per  ha of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and 0.40 to 0.50 tonne per ha of Palm Kernel Oil (PKO) from 4th to  30th year  of  its  productive  life  spam.

Oil  palm  crop  provides  the  excellent  substitute  of  importing the oil. In India, oil palm is being cultivated in 13 states by covering about 3,15,000  hectares  by 2017-18  under irrigated conditions. Potential states are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat,Â  Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Bihar.

Efforts of Government


In view of the importance and significance of oil palm cultivation, Department of Agriculture,  Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&amp;FW) had taken  up  Technology  Mission  on  Oilseeds  &amp;  Pulses  (TMOP)  in  1991 - 92  in  the  potential  states. 
A  comprehensive Centrally Sponsored Scheme Oil Palm Development Programme (OPDP ) was  taken up during Eighth &amp; Ninth Plan. 
During the Tenth and Eleventh Plan, Government of India  had provided support for oil palm cultivation under Centrally Sponsored Integrated Scheme of  Oilseeds, Pulses, Oil Palm and Maize (ISOPOM). 
To boost oil palm cultivation, Government of  India had implemented a Special Programme on Oil Palm Area Expansion (OPAE) under RKVY  from the year  2011-12 to  2014-15. 
During  the  12th Five  Year  Plan,  a  new  National  Mission  on  Oilseeds  and  Oil  Palm  (NMOOP) was  launched  under  which  Mini  Mission - II  (MM - II) was  dedicated  to  oil  palm  area expansion and productivity increases. MM - II of NMOOP was implemented in 12 States  viz; Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat, Karnataka, Odisha,  Mizoram,  Nagaland, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh w.e.f. 01.04.2014.

Interventions


Area  expansion  inputs  component covering assistance for planting material, maintenance/cultivation cost, inputs to inter-cropping in oil palm fields  during gestation  period  of  4  years. 
Production  inputs component  covering  drip-irrigation,  bore-well/water  harvesting structure,  diesel-pump  set,  vermi-compost  unit, establishment of new  seed  garden,  machinery  &amp;  tools,  special  component  for NE/hilly    states/LW   Areas   for    construction   of    roads    and establishment of new oil palm processing unit. 
Transfer of technologies   component   covering   assistance   for   training   of  9farmers/officers  demonstrations  on  oil  palm  at  farmer's  field, need   based   R&amp;D   projects   on   oil   palm   including   import   of germplasm  and  training  infrastructure  support  to  ICAR/SAUs, local  initiatives  /publicity  /contingency  including  monitoring  &amp; evaluation  and  operational  costs  including  Consultant  services etc.,  exposure  visits  of  farmers  /  officers  to  oil  palm  fields  / seminar /conference etc.

Objectives

Bring additional 1.05 lakh hectare area under oil palm cultivation through area expansion approach  in the  country during next two years ie. 2017-18  and 2019-20. The total area in the country  will be 4.20 lakh ha by the end of March 2020.

Implementing agency

Oilseeds Division, Department of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers Welfare will implement  the scheme at national level. Joint Secretary (Oilseeds) will  act as  Mission Director of NMOOP. The Principal Secretary  (Agriculture/Horticulture) of the respective state  will be in charge of the scheme at state level.

Area of  operation and funding pattern

Twelve states of  Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Assam, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil  Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh  will be covered under  this scheme.

The funds would be released to the states as per norms  of  NMOOP. The expenditure will be shared between Central and State Government in the ratio  of 90:10 for Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram and 60:40 for remaining States.

However,  100%  support  is  being  provided  to  Indian  Institute  of  Oil  Palm  Research  (IIOPR),  Pedavegi,  Andhra  Pradesh  for  supply  of  planting  materials,  need  based  R&D  and  extension  activities.

Interventions and Assistance

Under  the  MM-II of NMOOP, financial assistance are being provided to the farmers @  85% cost of the planting material  (Rs. 12000/ - per ha)  and @ 50% cost of the other components  like maintenance cost of new plantations for four years  (Rs. 20000/ - per ha),   inputs  for inter-cropping in oil palm during gestation period (Rs. 20000/ - per ha) , installation of drip - irrigation  systems,   diesel/electric   pump-sets,   bore-well (Rs.   50000/ - per   unit),  water   harvesting  structures/ponds, construction of vermi-compost units and purchasing of machinery & tools etc.
