Fish balls

There are several varieties of fish which do not command a ready market as fresh fish, but are comparable to many table fish in nutritive value and other attributes. One of the ways of ensuring effective utilisation of such fish is to process ready-to-serve or ready-to-cook value added `convenience' products, for which there already exists great demand from within the country as also from abroad. Fish ball is one such product prepared using fish mince and starch that can be processed as a coated product or as a heat-processed product in a suitable fluid medium.

Method of preparation

Mix mince prepared from fish using a mechanical meat bone separator after heading, gutting and washing thoroughly with 1 % salt and 5% corn starch (if required, spices like garlic, ginger etc. Can be added). 
Prepare balls, 2-3 cm in diameter, from the resultant mass and cook in boiling 1% brine for 5-10 minutes. 
 cool the cooked balls after which they are battered and breaded. 
Pack the balls preferably in thermoformed trays as such or after flash frying in hot vegetable oil. 
Preserve by freezing and store at -18°c. 

Fish balls before and after frying

Though mince from different species of fish can be used for processing fish balls, threadfin bream (nemipterus japonicus), pallikora (otolithus argenteusj and barracuda (sphyraena spp.) are found to yield satisfactory products. Mince from freshwater fishes such as rohu (labeo rohita) and catla (catla catla) also can be used. However, in such cases, the mince needs to be refined by passing through a mechanical strainer to get rid of the interstitial spines.
