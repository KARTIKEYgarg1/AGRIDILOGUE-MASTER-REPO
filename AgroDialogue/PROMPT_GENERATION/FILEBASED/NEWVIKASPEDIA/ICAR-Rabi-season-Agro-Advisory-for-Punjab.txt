Wheat

Improved varieties

Timely sown irrigated conditions: unnat pbw 343, unnat pbw 550, pbw 1 zn, pbw 725, pbw 677, hd 3086, wh 1105, hd 2967, pbw 621, whd 943 and pdw 291
Late sown irrigated conditions: pbw 752 and pbw 658
Time of sowing: first fortnight of november is the optimum sowing time of wheat crop. However, sowing of long duration varieties can be commenced from the fourth week of october.
Seed rate: 45 kg per acre for unnat pbw 550 and 40 kg for all other varieties.

For termite: in termite infested soil, treat the seed with 1 g cruiser 70 ws (thiamethoxam) or 2 ml neonix 20 fs (imidacloprid+hexaconazole) or 4 ml dursban/ruban/durmet 20 ec (chlorpyriphos) per kg seed and dry it in shade. Seed treated with neonix also control smuts of wheat.
For loose smut: treat 40 kg seed with 13 ml raxil easy/orius 6 fs (tebuconazole) by dissolving in 400 ml water or 120 g vitavax power 75 ws (carboxin+tetramethyl thiurum disulphide)
Seed inoculation: inoculate recommended quantity of seed for one acre with 500 g consortium or 250 g each of azotobacter and streptomyces (azo-s) biofertilizer and one litre of water on pucca floor.

Sowing method and spacing

Conventional sowing: sow wheat with a seed-cum-fertilizer drill at a depth of 4-6 cm. A spacing of 15-20 cm between the rows gives good yield.
Bi-directional sowing: in this method use half the recommended quantities of seed and fertilizer for sowing in one direction and the remaining half in the other direction (across the first direction).
Raised bed sowing: with the help of bed planter, using 30 kg seed per acre, two rows of wheat can be sown 20 cm apart on 37.5 cm wide bed with a 30 cm wide furrow between two beds.
Zero tillage sowing: wheat can be sown without any preparatory tillage. In weed infested fields, spray 500 ml gramoxone 24 sl (paraquat) in 200 litres of water per acre before sowing to control weeds.

Fertilizer application

Apply 90 kg urea and 55 kg dap per acre in medium fertility soils. Apply potassium to deficient soils only.

Weed control

To control of phalaris minor

Pre-emergence: stomp/dost/penda/markpendi/pendin/ bunker/zakiyama 30 ec (pendimethalin) @ 1.5 litre as, platform 385 se (pendimethalin + metribuzin) @ 1.0 litre per acre
Post-emergence: leader/sf-10/safal/ marksulfo 75 wg (sulfosulfuron)@ 13 g per acre
Post-emergence: isoproturon 75 wp@ 500g per acre

Control of broadleaf weeds only

2, 4-d sodium salt 80 wp@ 250 g, algrip/algrip royal/markgrip/makoto 20 wp (metsulfuron)@ 10 g per acre.

Irrigation

The first irrigation should be relatively light and given after three weeks to october sown crop and after four weeks to the crop sown later.
Army worm attack usually wheat during march-april, however it is also observed in the month of december in fields having large loads of paddy straw. It damages leaves and ear heads. Spray 400 ml ekalux (quinalphos) in 80-100 litres of water per acre with handoperated knapsack sprayer or in 30 litres of water with motorized sprayer. For better effectiveness of the insecticide, spraying should be done in the evening when armyworm larvae are more active. This insecticide will also control aphids.

Wheat sowing with happy seeder

The last irrigation to paddy crop should be planned in such a way that there is proper moisture in soil at the time of sowing of wheat with happy seeder/super seeder.
Depth of sowing should be between 1.5 to 2.0 inches.
Use 5-10 kg more seed per acre of wheat more than recommended in case of sowing with happy seeder.
Drill 65 kg dap/acre at sowing. Apply 40 kg urea/acre before first irrigation and broadcast another dose of 40 kg urea/acre before 2nd irrigation. It is cautioned that in heavy textured soils to avoid delay in urea application due to delay in second irrigation, broadcast 33kg urea/acre before sowing of wheat and the remaining before first irrigation.
Care should be taken that there is no clogging of seed and fertilizer tubes of happy seeder/super seeder. Tap the tubes with a stick to remove clogging, if required.
If pink stem borer/rice ear cutting caterpillar damage is observed in previous paddy crop, avoid sowing wheat in the month of october.
In case of wheat sown with happy seeder, first irrigation should be light and applied at 25-30 days in case of light textured soils and at 30-35 days after sowing in medium to heavy textured soils. In case of wheat sown with super seeder, apply irrigation as recommended for wheat cultivated with conventional methods. Apply irrigation after considering rainfall forecast.
Prefer to irrigate the fields during daytime to maximize predation of insects by birds.
Regularly monitor wheat crop sown in straw managed fields in the month of november- december to identify the problems related to insect pest, disease, or rodent. Use recommended practices for the management of insect pests, diseases, and rodents.
Use recommended pre- and post-emergence herbicides for control of weeds in case of crop sown with super seeder and only post emergence herbicides for crop sown with happy seeder.
Incorporation of paddy straw or its retention through happy seeder for more than three years helps in increasing the wheat productivity and improves soil health. From fourth year onwards, 20 kg urea can be saved per acre.

Seed rate and method of sowing

When sown as sole crop, 1.5 kg seed per acre is sufficient for rapeseed-mustard. Seed mixed with soil increases the bulk and thus ensures uniform distribution in the field. The depth of sowing should be 4-5 cm. Toria, raya, african sarson and taramira are sown in 30 cm and gobhi sarson in 45 cm apart rows. For sowing of canola gobhi sarson gsc 6 and hyola pac 401 during november, reduce row to row spacing to 30 cm.

Transplanting of gobhi sarson and african sarson

A successful crop of gobhi sarson or african sarson can be raised by transplanting. For higher yield, transplanting should be done in november.
Nursery raising: sowing of nursery should be undertaken about 60 days for gobhi sarson (gsl 1) and 30 days for canola gobhi sarson and african sarson ahead of the transplanting period. About eight marlas (200 sq. Metre) of nursery is sufficient for transplanting one acre. Broadcast uniformly 400 g seed of gobhi sarson or 600 g seed of african sarson.
Method of transplanting: after applying pre-sowing irrigation, prepare the field well. Draw furrows 45 cm apart for gobhi sarson and 30 cm apart for african sarson. Place one seedling at 10-15 cm distance. Close the furrows and irrigate the field immediately.
Bed planting: transplanting of gobhi sarson can also be done on raised beds for higher yield (10-15%) and saving (20-25%) of irrigation water.
Fertilizer application: apply 90 kg urea and 75 kg ssp per acre for raya, gobhi sarson and african sarson while 55 kg urea and 50 kg ssp per acre for toria.
Weed control: one hoeing to toria three weeks after sowing and one or two hoeing preferably with improved wheel hand hoe to raya, gobhi sarson, african sarson and taramira are adequate.
Harvesting and threshing: harvest the crop when siliquae turn yellow.

Sugarcane

Improved varieties

Early maturing varieties: copb 92, co 118, coj 85 and coj 64
Mid-late maturing varieties: copb 93, copb 94, co 238, copb 91 and coj 88

Time of planting

Mid-february to the end of march is the optimum time for planting sugarcane in the punjab. Do not plant early maturing varieties after march. Avoid late planting.

Seed selection

The seed should be free from red-rot, wilt, smut, ratoon-stunting and grassy shoot diseases. Use only the top two-third portion of the selected canes for planting.

Seed rate

Use 20 thousand three-budded setts or 15 thousand four-budded sets or 12 thousand five-budded setts per acre. In other words, 30- 35 quintal of seed is required for sowing one acre. Due to thick canes, seed rate of co 118 and coj 85 should be kept about 10% higher (on weight basis).

Seed treatment

To improve germination, soak the setts in ethrel solution overnight by dissolving 25 ml of ethrel 39 sl in 100 liters of water. Alternatively, soak the setts in water for 24 hours before planting.

Spacing and planting techniques

Trench planting: plant crop in rows 75 cm apart and 20-25 cm deep trenches. After placing the setts in trenches, cover the setts with 5 cm soil.
Paired row trench planting: plant two rows of sugarcane 30 cm apart in 20-25 cm deep trenches.
Furrow irrigated raised bed planting (firb): sugarcane can also be planted in standing wheat crop sown by furrow irrigated raised bed (firb) planter.
Sugarcane cutter planter: use two-row tractor operated whole cane cutter planter. The complete sugarcane which is fed by the labour sitting on the machine is cut automatically into pieces before dropping into the furrows.
Intercropping: intercrop one row of the recommended varieties of summer moong or summer mash in between two rows of sugarcane to get an additional grain yield of 1.5 to 2 q/acre of summer moong/summer mash. Mentha and okra can also be grown as an intercrop.
Fertilizer application: apply 130 kg urea per acre for plant crop and 195 kg urea per acre for ratoon.
Iron deficiency: spray the crop 2 or 3 times with 1% solution of ferrous sulphate (1 kg ferrous sulphate in 100 litres of water) at weekly intervals soon after the symptoms appear. 

Chemical weed control

Pre-emergence application of 800 g per acre atrataf/solaro/masstaf/ markazine 50 wp (atrazine) or sencor 70 wp (metribuzin) or karmex/klass 80 wp (diuron) in 200 litres of water within 2-3 days of planting effectively controls the broadleaf weeds and annual grasses. For control of hardy weed like bans patta, use only sencor 70 wp or karmex/klass 80 wp.
Irrigation: hot and dry period during april to june is the most critical period for the growth of sugarcane. During this period, irrigate the crop at 7 to 12 days interval.

Berseem

Improved varieties: bl 43, bl 42 and bl 10
Time of sowing: the last week of september to first week of october is the best time of sowing.
Inoculation: the inoculation of berseem with specific rhizobium culture will increase the forage yield.
Seed rate and method of sowing: 8-10 kg seed should be broadcasted in standing water when the weather is calm. For obtaining a high yield of good-quality fodder, mix 750g of mustard seed with the full seed-rate of berseem. Alternatively mix berseem with oats, using 12 kg seed of oats.
Manganese deficiency: spray the crop twice or thrice with 0.5% manganese sulphate solution (1 kg manganese sulphate in 200 litres of water per acre) at weekly intervals on sunny days. Spray the crop after two weeks of cutting.
Weed control: under situations where itsit (trianthema portulacastrum) is a problem, sow berseem mixed with raya which is fast growing crop and exerts tremendous smothering effect on this weed.
Irrigation: the first irrigation may be given within 3-5 days in light soils and 6-8 days in heavy soils after sowing. Afterwards it may be applied within 8-10 days during summer and 10-15 days during winter.
Harvesting: first cutting is ready in about 50 days after sowing and subsequent cuttings at 40 days intervals during winter and 30 days intervals in spring, thus giving 4-6 cuttings in all.
