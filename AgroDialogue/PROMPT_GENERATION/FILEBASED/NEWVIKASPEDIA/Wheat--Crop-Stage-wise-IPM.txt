Wheat: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre-sowing*

Common cultural practices: • deep ploughing of fields during summer to control nematodes population, to expose pupae and popagules of soil borne pathogens. • soil solarization • timely sowing should be done. • field sanitation, rogueing. • destroy the alternate host plants • growing pea or marigold as a trap crop for the management of leaf miner. • plant tall border crops like mustard for the management of aphids. • crop rotation with non-cereals. • adopt ecological engineering by growing the attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the field bunds.

Nutrients
• at the time of field preparation, apply fym @ 4.0 t/ acre 2-3 week before sowing or vermicompost @ 2.0 t/acre at one week before sowing. • grow suitable green manure crop to improve soil health.

Weeds
Cultural control: • at the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to minimize the weeds menace in field. • zero till practice is also minimize the weed seed germination.

Soil and seed borne pathogens, nematodes, termites, resting stage of insects
Cultural control: • apply well rotten farm yard manure only to discourage termite infestation. • avoid late sowing of crops. • for nematode: non host crops of gram mustard cumin carrots, onion are suggested for 3 years. • for others follow common cultural practices. Chemical control: for nematode: • carbofuran 3% cg @ 26640 g/acre , for termite: • thiamethoxam 30% fs @ 1.32 kg per 40 kg seeds or chlorpyrifos 20% ec @ 3 – 4 ml/kg seed and 0.8-1.2 l/acre as soil application

Sowing/seedling*

Wheat is a rabi crop that is grown in the winter season. Sowing of wheat takes place in october to december and harvesting is done during the months of february and may. The wheat crop needs cool winters and hot summers, which is why the fertile plains of the indo-gangetic region are the most conducive for growing it. Though well-drained loams and clayey loams are considered the ideal soil for wheat, good crops of wheat have also been raised on sandy loams and black soils of the peninsula region. India is broadly divided into 5 wheat zones based on agro-climatic conditions

1. The north-western plains zone: this is the most important zone and comprises the plains of the states of punjab, haryana, jammu, rajasthan and western uttar pradesh. The wheat here is planted in late october - november and the harvesting usually begins by middle of april.

2. The north eastern plains zone: this zone consists of eastern uttar pradesh, bihar, west bengal, assam, odisha, manipur, tripura, meghalaya, nagaland, mizoram, arunachal pradesh and sikkim. Since rice is harvested later in this area, wheat can be sown only in late november or early december. Harvesting is done by march - april.

3. The central zone: this zone consists of madhya pradesh, gujarat, southeastern rajasthan and the bundelkhand area of uttar pradesh. Almost 75 per cent of the wheat cultivated here depends on rain for irrigation. The best quality durum wheat is produced in this zone.

4. The peninsular zone: the peninsular zone consists of the southern states of maharashtra, andhra pradesh, karnataka, and tamil nadu. Sowing is usually completed by early november and harvesting begins in the second half of february. Wheat is produced the earliest in this zone.

5. The northern hill zone: this zone includes the hilly areas of kashmir, himachal pradesh, uttar pradesh, west bengal, assam and sikkim. Wheat is sown in october and harvested in may-june. The crop remains dormant in the cold months of november to march and starts growing as the temperature rises in april.

For good and uniform germination, the wheat crop requires a well pulverised but compact seedbed. The wheat seeds should be healthy and have a good germination capacity. Make sure the seeds for sowing don't contain any seeds of weeds. Experts suggest the use of certified seeds obtained from a reliable seed agency. Seeds need to be planted on time to conserve moisture for a good crop.

Nutrients
• seed treatment should be done with azotobactor culture @ 200 g/acre. • fertilizers should be applied on soil test basis. Generally, 60 kg n, 25 kg p2o5 and 20 kg k2o per acre is recommended for wheat. • apply 1/3 of n and full dose of p &amp; k at the time of sowing.

Weeds
• hand weeding

Soil and seed borne pathogens, nematodes, resting stage of insects
Cultural control: • for loose smut: the seed is soaked in cold water during hot summer months in the morning hours and kept in hot sun from 8 am -12 noons and then dried in the afternoon. This kills the fungus inside the seed and provides a good disease measure without use of fungicides. However, precautions to be taken so that there is no damage to the viability of seeds. • use resistant/tolarent varieties. • for seed gal nematode use certified seed resistance varieties only clean seed by sieving or by using 2% salt water floatation to remove galls and prevent ear cockle diseases. • use the tolerant varieties such as c-306 for brown mite. • dry cleaning: galls can be separated by coarse sieve from the healthy seeds. • winnowing or fanning • brine floatation: 2% salt solution in place of plain water removes almost 100 % galls. Biological control: • pseudomonas fluorescens 1.75% wp (in house isolated strain accession no. Mtcc 5176) @ 5 g/kg seed (seed treatment) • pseudomonas fluorescens 1.75% wp (in house isolated strain accession no. Mtcc 5176)@ 5 g/l (foliar spray) • apply neem cake@ 80 kg/acre. Chemical control: for nematode: carbofuran 3% cg @ 26640 g/acre , for loose smut: benomyl 50 % wp @ 2g/kg seeds or carbendazim 50% wp @ 2 g/ kg seeds or carboxin 75% wp @ 2 -2.5 g/kg seeds or tebuconazole 2% ds @ 0.2 kg/10 kg seed or carboxin 37.5% + thiram 37.5% ds @ 3.0 g/kg for flag smut: carboxin 75% wp@2 -2.5 g/ kg seed or tebuconazole 2% ds@0.2 kg/10 kg seed for bunt: carboxin 75% wp@ 2 -2.5 g/ kg seed for termite: thiamethoxam 30% fs @ 1.32 kg per 40 kg seeds or chlorpyrifos 20% ec @ 3 – 4 ml/kg seed and 0.8-1.2 l/acre as soil application

Mechanical control: • dismantle termitaria (termite mounds) around field and kill the termite queen. Biological control: • apply neem cake@ 80 kg/acre. Chemical control: • same as pre sowing stage

Vegetative

Common cultural practices: • provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop • avoid water stress and water stagnation conditions. • enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval parasitoids are observed common mechanical practices: • collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae • collect and destroy diseased and insect infected plant parts • use yellow sticky traps for aphids and blue sticky traps for thrips @ 4-5 traps/acre. • use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm • install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) • erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc. • set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm common biological practices: • conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering • augmentative release of natural enemies.

Cultural control: • for loose smut: in the standing crop, the plants showing yellowing owing of the boot leaf tip normally are the ones which will give smutted ear heads on emergence. Uproot such plants before ear emergence to reduce the infestation of healthy seeds at later stage. • use disease free seeds in the healthy field. For seed production, disease free field/areas to be identified for having crop without considerable inoculum load. Chemical control: for flag smut: • carboxin 75% wp@2 -2.5 gm/ kg seed or tebuconazole 2% ds@0.2 kg/10 kg seed or thiram 75% ws @ 10-12 g in 400 ml of water/acre for bunt: • carboxin 75% wp@ 2 -2.5 gm/ kg seed. • triadimefon 25% wp @ 200 g in 300 l of water/acre for loose smut: • same as pre-sowing stage

Note: the chemical dosages and spray fluid volumes are based on high volume sprayer. *apply trichoderma viride/harzianum and pseudomonas fluorescens as seed treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required). **pests of regional significance
