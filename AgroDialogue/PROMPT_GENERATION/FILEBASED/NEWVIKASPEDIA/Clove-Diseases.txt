Clove diseases

Seedling wilt

Disease symptom:

Seedling wilt is observed mainly in nurseries and causes 5 to 40% death of seedlings. 
Leaves of affected seedlings loose natural luster, tend to droop and ultimately die. 
The root system and collar region of the seedling show varying degrees of discolouration and decay. 

Survival and spread:

The fungus is soil-borne and remains in the soil as saprophyte for 2-3 years. 
The secondary spread is aided by wind, rain and irrigation water.

Favourable conditions:

High day temperature (30-35Ëšc). 
Low humidity (50-60%). 
Low soil moisture and alkaline soils

Leaf rot:

Disease symptom:

It is noticed in the nurseries as well as in the main field both at young and mature stages. 
Infection starts as dark spots at the leaf margin and spreads sometimes with no definite pattern.
Rotting may be in the whole leaf or at the tip resulting in defoliation.

Favourable conditions:

The fungus survives on diseased twigs and mummified fruits, either on the tree or on the ground. 
The fungul spores are air-borne and are also spread by rain splash and insects. Moderate temperatures and moist weather during bloom favour the disease

Disease symptom:

Necrotic spots of variable size and shapes are noticed on the leaves. 
Severely affected leaves wither, droop and dry up. 
Twigs are infected as the symptoms extend from the leaves through petioles.
The affected branches stand without leaves or only with young leaves at tips. 
Flower buds are attacked by spreading infection from the twigs. 
Shedding of flower buds occurs during periods of heavy and continuous rainfall.

Favourable conditions:

The fungus survives on diseased twigs and mummified fruits, either on the tree or on the ground. 
The fungus spores are air-borne and also spread by rain splash. 
Moderate temperatures and moist weather during bloom favour twig blight.
