Description of innovation
Shri ramsharan verma is able to determine banana crop needs by simply observing symptoms and status. In 1990, he started banana cultivation on 2.40 ha personal land and today plantation is spread across 36.0 ha on leased land of the fellow farmers. Tissue culture banana plantation at 1,100 plants per acre with a distance of 6’x6’ has been perfected by him. Per plant expenditure comes around rs 60-70 and gross income is of rs 300. One of the technique perfected in managing banana plants is cutting of plants at neck height after first harvest and reducing fertilizer application to half against recommended doses. This practice hastened crop harvest by two-and-half months. Secondly, the standing tree provided food to suckers at much higher rate as could be synthesized by suckers for growth and development. The observations indicated about 10 kg per plant higher fruiting than the plots from where the trunks were removed from the base of the harvest. Thereby additional gain of about rs 1.00 lakh per ha was attained. The farmers earned rs 4.40 lakh/ha from banana cultivation.
