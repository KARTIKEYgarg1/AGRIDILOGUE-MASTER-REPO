Mint crop stage wise ipm

Management

Activity

Pre-sowing

 

Common cultural practices:

Timely planting should be done. 
Field sanitation, rogueing

Nutrients

Nutrients should be applied on the basis of soil test report and recommendation for particular agro climatic zone. 
For production of stolons, select fertile soil with high organic matter content.
Apply farmyard manure @ 4 to 5 tons per acre in the last ploughing and incorporate in the soil 2 to 3 weeks before sowing.

Weeds

Summer ploughing should be done before planting. 
The rotation of mint crop with other crops should be followed. The best rotations are; 
Mint: rice, mint: potatoes and mint: vegetables : peas etc. Depending upon cropping system followed in the region.

Soil-borne pathogens, and resting stages of insects

Deep summer ploughing is helpful for minimizing soil borne pathogen and resting stages of insect pests by exposing them to unfavorable environmental conditions and predation by predators. 
Avoid water logging conditions.

Sowing / planting

 

Common cultural practices:

Use resistant varieties/disease free propagation material. 
Practice field sanitation. 
Timely sowing/planting

Nutrients

Apply fertilizers as per soil test recommendations

Weeds

Adopt stale seed bed in which field is irrigated and allow the weed seeds to germinate. The field is ploughed immediately before sowing to destroy the germinated weeds.

Vegetative stage

 

Common cultural practices:

Keep the field clean and healthy 
Remove and destroy alternate wild hosts and weeds 
Removal of weeds and infected young leaves for the control of powdery mildew. 

Common mechanical practices:

Remove the affected plant parts. 
Set up light trap@1trap/acre. 
Collect and destroy egg mass and larvae. 
Use yellow sticky traps @ 8-10/acre

Nutrients

Apply 20 kg of nitrogen per acre as top dressing twice after each harvest at 30 and 60 days after planting. 
Based on soil test report, micro nutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of particular nutrient.

Weeds

The crop requires intensive weeding during initial stage of the crop. 
Weeding with hand or mechanical hoes within the first six weeks of planting is required to control weeds at an interval of two to three weeks, after the first weeding. 
Adopt integrated weed management approach.

Cutworm/tobacco caterpillar

Mechanical control:

Installation of light traps. 

Biological control:

Conservation and augmentation of natural predators like coccinellids, chrysoperla, spiders, dragonflies should be followed. 
Augmentation of biocontrol agents like trichogramma brasiliensis, t. Chilonis and t. Pretiosum should be carried out.

Aphids

Cultural control:

Sowing of border crops like maize, sorghum or millet to reduce pest population and encourage natural enemies

Biological control:

Conservation and augmentation of predators such as syrphid fly, lacewing, ladybird beetle, praying mantis, minute pirate bug, damselfly, predatory thrips, and parasitoids, braconid wasp, aphidius spp

Mealy bug

Cultural control: 

Remove and destroy all the infested plant parts to prevent further spread of pests. 
Deep summer ploughing to expose soil inhabiting or resting stage of insect pests.

Biological control:

Conservation and augmentation of predators such as ladybird beetle, cryptolaemus montrouzieri, chrysopids, different species of parasitic wasps and predatory mites should be adopted.

Flea beetle

Cultural control:

Remove the weeds 
Follow crop rotation

Red pumpkin beetle

Cultural control: 

Deep summer ploughing. 
Follow crop rotation with non-host crops. 
Destroy the weeds growing in the field. 

Biological control: 

Conservation and augmentation of predators such as assassin bug (rhynocoris fuscipes) and parasitoids like gregarina crenata should be followed.

Hairy caterpillar

Mechanical control 

Collection and destruction of egg masses, skeletonized leaves along with first and second instar gregarious larvae. 

Biological control:

Conserve parasitoid such as meteorus arctiicida

Two spotted mite

Cultural control:

Observe the plants weekly for signs of mite damage, which first appears as flecks and stipples on the leaves. Collect leaf samples and examine the lower surface for all stages of mites. 

Biological control 

Conserve predatory mites like amblyseius, metaseiulus, and phytoseiulus; the minute pirate bugs, orius, leptothrips; chrysopa, cheilomenes sexmaculatus, and stethorus.

Mint rust

Mechanical control: 

In an infected bed, try to locate any uninfected stems and carefully dig these out and move to another location in an attempt to start a new, healthy nursery.

Verticillium wilt

Cultural control:

Applying optimal rates of nitrogen and enhanced dose of potash reduces the severity of verticillium wilt. 
Limiting the amount of water applied to the field can reduce severity of the disease 
Follow crop rotation.

Biological control:

Use bioagents like trichoderma sp. As per cibrc recommendations

Powdery mildew

Cultural control: 

Maintain proper row spacing 
Use resistant or tolerant varieties. 
Improve air circulation by thinningto reduce the disease severity.

Black stem rot

Cultural control: 

Use certified planting material to reduce the introduction and spread of black stem rot. 
Avoid transportation of contaminated planting materials

Stem and stolon canker

Follow the common cultural, mechanical and biological practices

Septoria leaf spot

Cultural control:

Use clean and certified planting materials

Ramularia leaf spot

Follow the common cultural, mechanical and biological practices

Leaf blight

Follow the common cultural, mechanical and biological practices

Anthracnose

Cultural control: Â· use resistant plants or healthy plant materials.
