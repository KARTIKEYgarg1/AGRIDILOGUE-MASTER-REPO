Agro-technique

Nursery technique

Raising propagules: the plants grow well under shade and can tolerate heavy shade. One-node stem cuttings can be planted. The root develops from the nodes.
Propagule rate and pretreatment: 300 kg rooted suckers are needed to plant one hectare land. No specific pretreatment is required.

Planting in the field

Land preparation and fertilizer application: the field should be prepared well by giving one ploughing and two harrowings, followed by planting. Manure (fym) at the rate of 20 t/ha should be mixed thoroughly with the soil at the time of field preparation. Npk fertilizers @ 100:50:50 kg/ha in 4 split doses are given.
Transplanting and optimum spacing: the planting can be done in february-march at a spacing of 45x45 cm with irrigation. It is an irrigated crop.
Intercropping system: the plant can be grown as pure crop in orchards of mango and other trees.
Interculture and maintenance practices: there is a profuse growth of weeds in the beds; hence it requires continuous hoeing and weeding. During monsoon months, it is essential to prevent water logging in the beds.
Irrigation practices: during dry months fortnightly irrigation is needed and needs drainage during rainy season.
Disease and pest control: no disease, pests or any other physiological disorder was observed in the experimental plantation.

Harvest management

Crop maturity and harvesting: the crop matures in 90 days period after planting. It is harvested through hand-cutting at fully grown leaf stage. The leaves are harvested in sunny weather to facilitate drying.
Post-harvest management: unwanted material is sorted out from the crop before the harvested material is dried in shade.
Chemical constituents: asiatic acid, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, brahmic acid, thankuniside, centellose. Total triterpinoids are in leaves and they are approximately 1.0% of leaves.
Yield and cost of cultivation: as a pure crop, 10-12 t/ha/years yield is obtained by 3 harvests in a year. After second year, the yield begins to decline, needing fresh planting. Rs. 40000/- is the cost of cultivation for one hectare.
