Livestock and fisheries

:

Animal vaccinations pre-winter needs to be done. Vaccination against foot and mouth disease in cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and pigs is to be repeated since it is given pre-monsoon and prewinter, twice in a year. Sheep and goats to be vaccinated against enterotoxaemia, goat pox and ppr disease during early months of rabi season say early sept. To oct. For poultry, vaccination schedule is to be followed as per age of the birds regardless of season.
 needs to be continued. For this, farmers should check their animals for signs of heat, especially during winter when the symptoms of heat are sometimes obscure. It is always advised to contact veterinary officer or para veterinary worker and get the animal inseminated at home instead of taking them to veterinary hospital, this becomes more relevant due to the current covid pandemic situation.
To maintain productivity and improve immune status of animals, farmers are suggested for regular supplementation of mineral minute - 60g/ day in adult dairy animals and 20-30g in small ruminants.
Try to deworm animals using broad spectrum dewormer as per advice of veterinary doctor &amp; remove ecto-parasites using safe insecticide sprays, one to two weeks prior to vaccination. When applying insecticide spray it is important to dilute them in water as per recommendation of the manufacturer and proper mask needs to be worn by the person using the spray.
The frequency of washing and bathing animals should be reduced during peak winter months. Animal housing needs to be strengthened so that cold exposure to animals may be minimized. This is especially important for northern parts of the state.
Demand for meat and meat products increases during winter season and farmers need to plan their production cycle so that they can sell their meat animals during this season. Poultry and goat farmers need to increase the fat and carbohydrate portion of the diet of animals so as to increase their body weight faster and fetch more market price.
Farmers should practice physical distancing, regular washing of hands and wearing mask whenever they go to market for sale and purchase of farm produce. Give preference to online marketing channels and prefer selling direct to customer to fetch more price and this also reduces going to crowded marketplaces. 

Fodder cultivation and preservation

Sowing of fodder crops like maize, jowar, oat etc. And leguminous fodder crops like barseem, lucerne and cowpea etc. Should be initiated with the onset of rabi season. Procurement of seed, land preparation and inputs required for cultivation of fodder crops should be started as early as possible.
During the late part of rabi season, when harvesting of crops are done, it is highly advised to preserve fodder for summer season when there is imminent scarcity of fodder for livestock. For central and southern parts of chhattisgarh making ‘hay’ is advised while in northern cooler parts of the state, making ‘silage’, along with ‘hay’ is advised.
For making hay crops like oat, napier, lucerne, berseem, peas, cowpea, chick pea, field bean, are suitable and for silage making crops like maize, jowar, para grass and napier are most suitable for the state.
Paddy straw needs to be stored as dry fodder in quantities sufficient to cover entire winter and summer till monsoon. Enrichment of paddy straw by urea treatment should be undertaken. Neem coated urea can also be used for this purpose.
Feed requirement for animals and human being is generally more during winter. Increase the animal ration by 5-10% during winter season to maintain production of animals.
Take special care so that agricultural pesticides and disinfectants do not get mixed with animal feed and fodder even in little quantities.

Cattle and buffalo

In chhattisgarh as per the breeding policy artificial insemination is preferred in rural areas using indian cattle milch breeds - gir, red sindhi and sahiwal and dual breed – tharparker, ongole, kankrej and hariana while in semiurban area cross breeding with half bred jersey and hf is advised. In urban areas and large dairy farms depending on the rearing condition and market demand ai services is advised.
Purchase of animals for dairy farming is advised during early months of rabi season because of suitability of climate, high availability of green fodder and possibility of getting kisan credit card linked loans from financial institutions is more soon after kharif season is over, and msp are released.
Animals need protection from cold winds especially during night. Open sheds need to be partially covered using gunny bags and adequate bedding materials. However, proper ventilation is important in cattle shed in winter especially in northern and southern parts of the state which tends to get suffocative.
Provide green succulent forage together with leguminous hay or straw to the extent of animal can consume, so that all its maintenance requirements are met with through forage only. Extra concentrate at the rate of 1 kg for every 2 to 2.5 litres of milk should be provided. Salt and mineral supplements should be given to maintain the lactation.
High milking breeds require calcium supplementation in order to prevent metabolic diseases like milk fever and ketosis.
Water requirement decreases a little during winter. However, in very cold periods warm water must be provided. Watch individual animal for symptoms of mucous secretion from muzzle, sneezing, cough or difficulty in breathing, in the event of which immediate veterinary aid should be sought.
Provide at least 60 - 90 days dry period between calving. If the dry period is not sufficient, the milk yield is subsequent lactation will be reduced. Extra concentrate mix of 1.25 to 1.75 kg should be provided for pregnant animal as pregnancy allowance.
Wallowing of buffaloes in water is best avoided in winter months.
Feed laxative about 3 - 5 days before and after calving (wheat bran 3 kg + 0.5 gm of groundnut cake + 100 gm of mineral mixture of salt).
Cattle and buffaloes are not seasonal breeders, hence care and management of pregnant animals, during parturition, after parturition and care and handling of newborn calf is as recommended throughout the year. However, since research indicates more incidence of dystokia in winter, farmers are advised to be more vigilant and keep veterinary officer informed beforehand regarding the scheduled date of parturition. 

Small ruminants (goats)

Farmers are advised to start preparing for breeding of sheep and goats in rabi season by increasing ration for breedable male and female goats and keeping close observation for signs of heat. Being seasonal breeders, they tend to breed from september to november but may continue to february. This is more prominent in northern chhattisgarh while in rest of the state, being truly tropical they breed throughout the year.
Goat farmers of central and north chhattisgarh may choose among breeds like jamunapari, beetal and sirohi while southern regions may prefer black bengal instead of sirohi. Farmers need to upgrade their desi nondescript goat stocks with male of these breeds.
The males should be replaced or exchanged once in two years to avoid inbreeding. Hence, all replacements should be done before the onset of rabi so that the new animal inducted may have sufficient time for acclimatization.
In order to synchronize them improved hormonal technology may be used, or buck may be in a partitioned corral of woven-wire net so that the does and the buck may have full view of each other. This may be done a week or two before or during the breeding season.
Efforts should always be made to avoid kidding during the peak winter season of january month which can be practically achieved by a planned breeding avoiding summer season within a specified period between 15th may to 15th june. This will save the kids from cold susceptibility and resultant pneumonic death during winter.
Goats are particularly sensitive to cold and winter rains triggers many diseases. Farmers of northern regions of the state should provide covered night shelters during peak winter but should not use fireplace or sigri to warm the closed shelter because this may lead to quick accumulation of noxious gasses and can be life threatening.
Small and weak animals should be covered with a body cover made from jute gunny bags or cotton cloth. Such animals should be given warm water with added jiggery.
The beddings of animals need to be replaced more frequently during rabi. This will protect them from cold as well as diseases especially parasitic diseases.
In this season due to close contact of herding animals like sheep and goats’ infectious diseases spreads faster. Farmers need to be vigilant for off-feed animals and symptoms like running nose, sneezing, and coughing.
During this season, to escape from severe winter, large flocks of migratory sheep and goats arrive from parts of hp, up, gujrat and rajasthan into the central parts of chhattisgarh through mp and maharashtra. All such flocks, if not previously, need to be vaccinated against hs, fmd, ppr and enterotoxaemia and quarantined for 15 days at border areas. Local sheep and goat farmers should make every attempt not to allow their own flocks to mix with these migratory herds.

Commercial and backyard poultry

Commercial large poultry farms have little seasonal variation in their rearing practice. However, due to increased market demand they should plan their production cycle so that their output increases by a significant margin to gain more profits, loess stocking and cater to consumer requirement.
Commercial poultry farmers should adhere strictly to their vaccination schedule which is dependent on age of birds rather than seasonality. However, rural backyard poultry farmers need to vaccinate their birds against ranikhet disease and fowl pox.
Due to proximity of birds in winter communicable disease spreads very fast. Hence strict daily vigil must be done for a sample of birds in large farm or each and individual bird in the flocks reared under backyard condition. If disease symptoms like drooping, ruffled feathers, coryza, discoloration or pock marks erupting in comb and wattles, diarrhea with white or reddish discoloration are observed the birds need to be quarantined immediately for 5-7 days or till full recovery is attained as per advice of registered veterinary practitioner or para-veterinary personnel under supervision.
Deworming of backyard poultry with any broad spectrum dewormer is advised before onset of rabi as per veterinary advice and prevalence of parasitic diseases in the area.
Disinfect the premises of poultry houses with 1% sodium hypochlorite and restrict the entry of any outsider to the poultry houses and premises.
The moisture and quality of the litter materials in poultry shed need to be maintained to prevent coccidiosis infestation.
Migratory birds arrive in parts of eastern central chhattisgarh from parts of odisha and northern chhattisgarh from parts of north india. Hence, poultry farmers must be vigilant not to allow their poultry in direct or indirect contact with the migratory birds. In case of any unusual death of migratory, poultry or any other birds in the area farmers should immediately inform nearest veterinary officer.

Fisheries

Farmers are advised to stock larger size advanced fingerlings in the perennial stocking ponds, community ponds and reservoirs.
Every month in rabi fish farmers need to apply lime at the rate of 10 kg per acre in perennial water bodies.
Organic and inorganic fertilizers should be applied for production of natural feeds. Doses should be decided as per organic carbon content in the soil.
Fishes should be fed supplementary feed at the rate of 10% body weight along with natural feed.
Supplementation of vitamin and mineral mixture at the rate of 1% of feed weight (1 kg per 100 kg feed) should be continued.
Netting should be done monthly to release the noxious gasses from the pond bottom for observing fishes for disease symptoms and recording growth of fishes for calculating feed required.
Since in rabi rain and other water sources from catchment area generally decreases hence alternative ground water source should be made ready.
To have regular annual income fish farmers are advised to adopt integrated fish farming model. Under this initiative, due to decreasing water level in water bodies, especially during later part of rabi, combining fisheries with poultry, duck farming and goatery is advised.
During winter months feed requirement for fish decreases, hence farmers are advised to decrease the feeding quantity as winter temperature decreases.
During mid rabi there is increased demand for fish and fish products. Hence, farmers should plan their production cycle so that they harvest maximum during that period to gain more economically.
