A single oral dose of 10 g piperazine adepate is recommended for the calves preferably in the first week of life to control neonatal ascariasis especially in buffalo calves.
Deworming should be done every month for first 6 months, thereafter once in three months.
The deworming drugs and dose should be consulted with qualified veterinary doctor.
Over dose and under dose of deworming drugs should be prevented to check the side effects.
