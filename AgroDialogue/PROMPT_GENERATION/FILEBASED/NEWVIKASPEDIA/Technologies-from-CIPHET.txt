Technologies from ciphet

Central institute of post harvest engineering and technology (ciphet), ludhiana, punjab has developed and commercialised many technologies under the all india coordinated research project on post harvest technology. The all india coordinated research project on post harvest technology was launched by the icar in september 1972 at ten locations. During the v, vi and ix plans, eleven more centres were inducted. In x plan efc, eight new centres were started and four existing centres were assigned enlarged mandate on dairy, fisheries, horticulture, and meat products. Besides, five ongoing centres of aicrp on jaggery and khandsari were merged with aicrp on pht w. E. F. April 2004. During xi plan, four new centres (cau gangtok, bau ranchi, mafsu mumbai and kva&fsu mangalore) have been approved by the planning commission.

Technologies developed and commercialised under aicrp on pht are detailed below.

Pkv mini dal mill

Specifications and salient technical features
Dimensions: 1.5 m (l) × 1.3 (b) × 1.8 (h) weight – 320 kg it consists of dehulling unit, sieve unit, screw conveyor, blower, cyclone separator and splitter. It operates using 3 hp single phase electric motor. One semiskilled and another unskilled labour are required to operate the mill. The space requirement is 250 m2 (50 m2 room and 200 m2 drying yard).the whole grain, dal, broken, husk and powder are separated mechanically. Pulses are transported to commercial dal mills in urban areas and finished product goes back for consumption to villages which impose burden of transportation on producer as well as consumer. However, a sizable portion of pulses were milled by burr mills, where the recovery seldom exceeds 55%. In order to have solution to these problems the pkv mini dal mill was developed with cleaning and grading of grains as well as polishing of split dal in a single unit and commercialized.

Performance results (efficiency, capacity of operation, losses etc.)
The processing capacity of dal mill is 100 -125 kg/h for pigeon pea and 125 – 150 kg/h for green gram and black gram. The respective dal recoveries are 72 – 75 % and 80 – 82 %.

Cost (initial investment and operating cost in rs/h and rs/unit output)
Cost of unit – 55000/- (excluding tax) initial investment – rs. 60,000/- operating cost - rs. 175/q of raw material () and rs. 220/h

How the new technology will impact the income of the farmers?
Increased dal recovery of about 17 % can be achieved by using pkv mini dal mill over conventional system besides decrease in losses. Maximum unit operations are mechanized which results in significant reduction in labour and time of operation. Dusty atmosphere is avoided.

Pkv chilli seed extractor

Specifications and salient technical features
Dimensions: 2.44 m(l) ×1.42 m(b) × 1.78 m (h)weight – 4.13 kgpresently the chilli seed is extracted by filling in bags and beating with wooden sticks. This is a tedious method. Inhalations of fine particles result in continuous sneezing and irritation of labour’s body. Due to this, it is difficult to get the labour for this operation. The problem becomes more severe on large scale i.e. In seed processing plants, seed companies, etc. This method has low output and efficiency. To avoid this, a chilli seed extractor was developed with 100-125 kg/h capacity operated by 2.0 hp single phase electric motor. It consists of drum with flat pegs enclosed inside the casing and the pegs are arranged in such a way that when rotated each peg of drum passes between two pegs on the stationary belts on casing. This arrangement enables to break all the chilli fruits entering the casing by impact. The screen was provided below the drum to separate the seed from chilli husk. The recovery of seed from chilli fruits is about 94 – 98 % at 9 – 10 % m.c. (wb) with no deterioration on seed germination. It being closed system minimized the sneezing and body irritation.

Performance results (efficiency, capacity of operation, losses etc.)
Capacity – 100-125 kg/h dry red chilli fruits.seed recovery – 94 - 98 %

Cost (initial investment and operating cost in rs/h and rs/unit output
Unit cost – rs. 62,125/- (excluding tax)initial investment rs. 1,12,500/-operating cost rs. 75/h and rs. 75/q

How the new technology will impact the income of the farmers?
Besides minimizing sneezing and body irritation, the capacity of seed extraction is 2-3 times more than the conventional system with no deterioration in seed germination and good seed recovery (94-98%).

How the new technology will impact the income of the farmers?
Conventional threshing efficiency of madua is upto 30 per cent where as that of madira is up to 50 percent only. Similarly threshing capacity of madua is 15-20 kg/hr and that of madira is 30-35 kg/hr. Due to this low capacity as well as low efficiency in the conventional threshing, the cost of labor increases, quality reduces thereby reducing the net profit. Labour cost reduction is rs 50/q (for pearling) and reduction in post harvest losses is 5-6 percent. Therefore, using vivek madua/madira thresher cum pearler net profit increased.

Safe storage of pulses using sand layer

Specifications and salient technical features
The technology provides total control of bruchid infestation in stored pulse grains without use of chemicals. It is particularly suitable for small and marginal farmers for safe storage of their pulses.the technology involves two steps – i) extended sun-drying of pulse grains on a concrete threshing yard / black tarpaulin / black polyethylene sheet for 25 hours (spread over 3-5 days) in a single grain layer and, ii) storage of the dried pulse grain in a plastic or metal bin with one inch thick layer of dry sand spread uniformly on the top of the grain surface. The storage bin is then covered with a tight lid without disturbing the sand layer till the end of storage period.

Performance results (efficiency, capacity of operation, losses etc.)

The technology has undergone extensive farm trials in farmers’ house-holds and has been included in the package of practices of the university of agricultural sciences, bangalore

Shell fired copra dryer

Specifications and salient technical features
A shell fired copra dryer was developed to dry coconut in 24 h which works on indirect heating and natural convection principles using coconut shell as fuel. The capacity of the dryer developed is 1000 nuts per batch. The drying air temperature in the drying chamber maintain 80 0c. The unique burner was designed; generate heat for 5 hours without tending and the heat is retained for one more hour. No electrical energy is used in this dryer making it farmer friendly. Once the fuel is charged it produces heat for 6 hours thereby allowing the farmer to do other useful work as compared to other dryers where in fuel is loaded once in 15-20 minutes. Smoke does not come into contact with the copra; hence the copra produced is of good quality. About 100 grams of shell charcoal is also produced during the final phase of heating.
