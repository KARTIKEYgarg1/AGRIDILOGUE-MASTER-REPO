Seed treatment

Advantages of seed treatment
Protects germinating seeds and seedlings against soil and seed borne pathogens/insects. 
Seed germination enhancement.
Early and uniform establishment and growth
Enhances nodulation in legume crop.
Better than soil and foliar application.
Uniform crop stand, even in adverse conditions (less/high moisture)

Procedure for seed treatment
Seed treatment is a term that describes both products and processes. Seed treatment can be done in one of the following types.
Seed dressing: this is the most common method of seed treatment. The seed is dressed with either a dry formulation or wet treated with a slurry or liquid formulation. Dressings can be applied at both farm and industries. Low cost earthen pots can be used for mixing pesticides with seed or seed can be spread on a polythene sheet and required quantity of chemical can be sprinkled on seed lot and mixed mechanically by the farmers.

Seed coating: a special binder is used with a formulation to enhance adherence to the seed. Coating requires advanced treatment technology, by the industry.

Seed pelleting: the most sophisticated seed treatment technology, resulting in changing physical shape of a seed to enhance palatability and handling. Pelleting requires specialized application machinery and techniques and is the most expensive application.
