Hybrids and varieties of grain sorghum for kharif

Introduction

Sorghum is one of the main staple food for the poor people across the semi arid tropics. It is mainly consumed by poor farmers. India contributes about 16% of the worldâ€™s sorghum production. It is the fourth most important cereal crop in the country and also contributing green fodder, feed and biofuel.

This crop was one of the major cereal during the 1950s contributing to more than 10% of the food basket. At present, it is reduced to less than 4.0%. Sorghum cultivation is taken up in 5.97 m ha with a production of 5.01 million tonnes (ref : agricultural statistics at a glance 2018 of department of agriculture, cooperation and farmers welfare). There has been rapid improvement in productivity - 466 kg/ ha in 1971 as against 998 kg/ ha in 2017-18. This has been possible through use of productive hybrids and varieties and adoption of improved production technologies. In the last three decades productivity has gone upto 84% in case of kharif sorghum and 70% in rabi sorghum.
