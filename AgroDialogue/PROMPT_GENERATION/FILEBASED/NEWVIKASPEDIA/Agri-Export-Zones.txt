Agri export zones

The concept of agri export zone (aez) was introduced in 2001, through exim policy 1997-2001, to take a comprehensive look at a particular produce/product located in a contiguous area for the purpose of developing and sourcing the raw materials, their processing/packaging, leading to final exports.

The concept hinged primarily on convergence of existing central and state government schemes to take care of financial interventions required at various stages of value chain; partnership among various stakeholders viz. Central government, state government, farmer, processor, exporter etc.; and focus on targeted products and areas to identify required policy interventions.
