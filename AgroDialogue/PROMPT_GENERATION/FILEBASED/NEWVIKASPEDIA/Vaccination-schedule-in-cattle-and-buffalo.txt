Points to be noted

Animals should be in good health at the time of vaccination. Do not vaccinate animals which are already in stress (like bad weather, scarcity of fodder &amp; water, disease outbreaks, after transportation etc.) 
Try to deworm animals &amp; remove ecto-parasites one to two weeks prior to vaccination.
 strictly follow vaccination schedule after consultation with veterinary experts. 
Keep records of vaccination for name of vaccine manufacturing company, batch number, expiry date, dose &amp; route of vaccine.
 maintain cold chain for vaccines which may have to keep for 2-8 degree celsius temperature. 
Create stress free environment for animals after vaccination.
