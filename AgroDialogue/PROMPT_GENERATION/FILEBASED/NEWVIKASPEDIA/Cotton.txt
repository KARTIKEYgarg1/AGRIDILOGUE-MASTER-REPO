Cotton

Cotton plays a key role in the national economy in terms of direct and indirect employment and income generation in the agricultural and industrial sectors. Textiles and related exports of which cotton constitutes nearly 65%, account for nearly 33% of the total foreign exchange earnings of our country which at present is around 12 billion dollars with a potential for a significant increase in the coming year. India is the only country to grow all the four species of cultivated cotton. Gossypium arboreum and g.herbaceum (asian cotton), g.barbadense (egyptian cotton) and g.hirsutum (american upland cotton) besides hybrid cotton. Gossypium hirsutum represents 90% of the hybrid cotton in india and all the current bt cotton hybrids are g.hirsutum. Cotton is cultivated in three distinct agro-ecological regions (north, central and south) of the country.
