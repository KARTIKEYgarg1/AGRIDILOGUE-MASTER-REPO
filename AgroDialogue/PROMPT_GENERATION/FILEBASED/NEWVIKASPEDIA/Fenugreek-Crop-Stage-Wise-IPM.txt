Fenugreek crop stage-wise ipm

Management
 
Activity

Pre-sowing

 

Common cultural practices: 

Deep ploughing of fields during summer to control soil borne pathogens and weeds. 
Soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 75 gauge thickness for six weeks during summer months . It will help in reducing the soil-borne pathogens, insect pests and weeds. 
Timely and line sowing should be done. 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Destroy the alternate host plants 
Soil test based application of manures and fertilizers. 
Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum for the management of mites and thrips. 
Follow crop rotation of non-host crops like cereal crops for 3 years. 
Adopt ecological engineering by growing the attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the field bunds.

Nutrients

Get the soil sample tested and apply nutrients based on soil test report. Soil is brought to fine tilth by 2-3 ploughing with harrow or plough. 
Incorporate 4 to 5 tonnes of farm yard manure per acre in soil 2-3 weeks before sowing.

Weeds

Solarisation of soil during summer reduces weed infestation

Sowing

Nutrients

Apply 8 kg n, 20 kg phosphorus and 20 kg potash per acre at the time of sowing as basal dose.

Soil borne fungus, resting stages of insects and weeds

Cultural control: 

Soil solarization should be followed. 

Biological control: 

Apply neem cake @ 80 kg/acre at the time of sowing for reducing borer damage as well as to reduce the soil borne diseases while preparing the nurseries.

Root rot and collar rot

Cultural control:

Avoid excessive watering 
Use raised beds: more than 15 cm height is better for water drainage

Damping off

Cultural control:

Avoid excessive watering 
Follow crop rotation 

Biological control: 

Apply neem cake @ 80 kg/acre at the time of sowing for reducing the disease 
Soil application: apply trichoderma viride @ 2kg/100kg of fym/acre.

Weeds

Sowing should be done in lines to facilitate hoeing and weeding operations during vegetative stage.

Diseases and insect pests

Select resistant varieties.

Vegetative stage

 

Common cultural practices: 

Avoid water stress and water stagnation conditions. 
Collect and destroy diseased and insect infected plant parts. 
Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 

Common mechanical practices: 

Collection and destruction of eggs of pests and early stage larvae
Use yellow/blue pan water/ sticky traps for aphids @ 4-5 trap/acre.

Common biological practices: 

Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies.

Nutrients

Apply second half of n as top dressing in two splits i.e. 4 kg per acre at 25-30 days after sowing and remaining 4 kg at 40-45 days after sowing.

Weeds

The crop should be kept free from weeds for proper growth and development of plants. Generally, 2-3 hand weeding are required to keep the weeds under control. 
In drilled crop light intercultural operation is beneficial. 1st weeding and hoeing should be done at 25-30 days after sowing and 2nd weeding at one month after 1st weeding.

Aphids

See common cultural and biological practices. 

Cultural control: 

If aphid population is limited to just a few shoots then the infested plant can be pulled out 

Biological control 

Conserve and augment lady bird beetles and lacewings. 
Spraying with tobacco decoction (1 kg tobacco boiled in 10 l of water for 30 minutes and making up to 30 l + 100 g soap). 
Insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or nske 5% are usually the best method of control

Leaf miner

Cultural control: 

Avoid excess use of nitrogen. 

Biological control: 

Conservation of natural enemies. 
Spray nske 5%.

Stem fly

Cultural control: 

Follow crop rotation biological control 
Apply neem cake @ 80 kg/acre at the time of sowing for reducing damage

Lucerne weevil

Cultural control: 

Follow crop rotation biological control 
Apply neem cake @ 80 kg/acre at the time of sowing for reducing damage 
Spray nske 5% or neem oil 0.5 to 1% (max. 2%).

Mites

Cultural control: 

Keep the field free of weeds 
Remove and destroy infested crop residues

Biological control: 

Spray nske (5%)

Thrips

Cultural control: 

Use blue sticky traps/water pan traps 5/acre.

Cercospora leaf spot

Cultural control: 

Follow field sanitation.

Charcoal rot

Cultural control: 

Organic soil amendments such as the addition of manure or neemcake can be used to reduce levels of inoculum in the soil 
Follow crop rotation

Powdery mildew

Cultural control: 

Use adequate spacing when planting to avoid overcrowding

Mosaic

Cultural control: 

Manage the vector by adopting common practices for the aphid.

Mechanical control: 

The infected plants should be removed in the early stage of plant growth. 
Remove weed host 
Install yellow sticky traps 4-5 per acre.

Rust

Cultural control: 

Balanced use of manures and fertilizers. 
Uproot the alternate host.

Downy mildew

Cultural control: 

Use adequate spacing when planting to avoid overcrowding

Fusarium wilt

Cultural control: 

Avoid excessive watering 
Follow crop rotation 

Biological control: 

Apply neem cake @ 80 kg/acre at the time of sowing for reducing the disease 
Soil application: apply trichoderma viride 2kg/100kg of fym/acre.

Reproductive/fruiting stage

Weeds

Remove weeds to prevent weed seed spread in field.

Pests and disease

Same as vegetative stage.

Spotted pod borer

Cultural control: 

The avoidance of broad-spectrum pesticides prior to flowering may help conserve natural enemies; however, beneficial insects are unlikely to control populations above about 10 per square metre. 
Follow common mechanical and biological practices
