Trend analysis of marine fisheries of india

Introduction

The fisheries sector plays an important role in indian economy contributing about 1% to the gross domestic product (gdp). The marine fish production in the country gradually increased from mere 5.8 lakh t in 1950 to 3.32 million t in 2010, registering a six-fold increase. The development of fisheries sector in india can be classified into three phases. During the first phase (1950 – 66), landings were mainly by non-mechanized indigenous crafts and gears and remained below one million t. The second phase spanning from 1967- 86 featured increased mechanization, improved gear materials, an introduction to motorized country crafts, expansion in export trade, etc. The last phase during 1987 – 2010 witnessed an intensification of mechanization as well as motorization of country crafts, modification of gears, multi-day voyage fishing and expansion of fishing grounds. Export earnings from marine sector increased from rs 3.92 crores in 1961-62 to rs 12,901.47 crores in 2010-11 registering 11.8% growth during 2009-10.

The gross revenue from the marine fish landings during 2009-10 regarding landing centre price was estimated as rs 19,753 crores. The total fisherfolk population of the country is 3.52 million having 0.72 million active fishermen. There are about 2,39,000 fishing crafts engaged in marine capture fisheries, of which 59,000 are mechanized crafts, 76,000 motorized and the rest non-mechanized. In the mechanized sector, there are about 29,000 trawlers. Though fishing is concentrated mainly in the depth zone up to 100 m, deep sea trawlers operate up to 400 m depth zone.

Overview of indian marine fisheries

A tremendous growth is witnessed in indian marine fisheries in the past six decades; it raised from 0.66 million t during 1950-60 to 3.06 million t in 2006-10. An average landing has increased significantly with maximum growth percentage observed during 1971-80, which could be attributed to the introduction of motorized country crafts. This is mainly due to the increased landings of oil sardine, the major contributor of this group, by extending its areas of an intensive harvest to the entire south region both on east and west coasts. Apart from this, the introduction of new gears like purse seines and ring seines augmented the exploitation of pelagic shoals like sardines and anchovies. In case of mackerel landings, fluctuations were high during the first four decades with maximum growth rate during 1991-2000 and showed negative growth during the last decade. The seer fish landings showed positive growth throughout the period with the greatest growth during 1991-2000 and minimum during the last decade. Steady growth was observed in the landings of tuna from 1975 onwards, and the growth rate gradually reduced over decades. Bombay duck landings registered positive growth throughout the period, though the growth rate was slow in the later periods. The landings of silver bellies have shown upward growth from 1965 to 1990 and remained steady after that. Similarly, arrivals of barracudas have shown steady growth from 1981 onwards. Except for the period 1991-2000, the landings of pomfrets showed positive growth trend. Catfish landings fluctuated in an oscillatory manner and had shown high growth rate in the last decade. Landings of flatfishes remained low until 1980, showed increasing trend during the subsequent 20 years and the catch slightly reduced during the last 10 years. Elasmobranch landings were recorded fast growth initially, declined later and exhibited negative growth in the last decade. In the later half of the last decade, there was a slight increase in elasmobranch landings, though statistically not significant. The landings of mullets have shown increase up to 2000 and slightly declined in the last decade. Unicorn cod landings decreased over the decades, and the landings were less during the last 10 years. An increasing trend was observed in the crustacean landings from 1970. This could be attributed to the extension of fishing ground beyond 100 m depth zone to exploit deep sea crustacean resources. A consistent growth was observed in molluscs landings from 1975 onwards mainly because of the targeted fishing and the maximum growth was observed during 1971-80. The growth was comparatively low during 2001-10.
Species wise trend

Clupeids are one of the most important group of pelagic fishes, which comprises of oil sardine (sardinella longiceps), lesser sardines (sardinella albella, sardinella gibbosa, sardinella fimbriata and sardinella sirm), white baits (stolephorus spp., enchrasicholina spp.) and anchovies (thryssa spp., setipinna spp. And coilia spp.). Clupeids has accounted greater than 20% of the total marine fish landings in india and a maximum of 38% accounted during 1961 – 70. And, the decadal average has improved from 173,299 t (1950-60) to 739,135 t (2001-10), it increases except the 1960s and 1970s. The cv was high in the early decades but has reduced to about 16% in the last three decades indicating comparatively less variability in the landings as compared to prior years. The maximum landings of clupeids (929,404 t) were recorded in 2010.

The decadal average of mackerel landings increased from 74,405 t during 1950-60 to 1,70,468 t during 1991-2000 and then reduced to 1,50,063 t during 2001-10. Though the average landings over decades increased, the percentage contribution of mackerel towards total landings decreased from 11.33% during 1950-60 to 5.41% during 2001-10. During the past 10 years, average mackerel landings significantly increased from 113,274 t in the first half to 186,853 t in the second half. The cv in landings of mackerel was high in the initial decades, and during the last 20 years it has reduced, showing less fluctuation in landings.
