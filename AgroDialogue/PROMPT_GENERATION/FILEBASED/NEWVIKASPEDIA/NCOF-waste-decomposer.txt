Ncof waste decomposer

National centre of organic farming(ncof) has developed a waste decomposer culture which is used for quick composting from organic waste, soil health improvement and as plant protection agent. It is a consortium of micro organism extracted from desi cow dung. 

The waste decomposer is sold in a bottle of 30 gms costing rs. 20/- per bottle directly through ncof and regional organic farming centres (rcof) to farmers. The waste decomposer is also validated by icar. A single bottle decomposes bio-waste of more than 10000 metric tons just in 30 days.

How to prepare waste decomposer solution from the started culture?
Take 2 kg jaggery and mixed it in a plastic drum containing 200 liters water. 
Now take 1 bottle of waste decomposer and pour all its contents in a plastic drum containing jaggery solution. Avoid direct contact of contents with hands.
Mix it properly with a wooden stick for uniform distribution of waste decomposer in a drum. 
Cover the drum with a paper or cardboard and stir it every day once or twice. 
After 5 days the solution of drum turns creamy.

Farmers could prepare the waste decomposer solution again and again from the above formed solution. For this, 20 liter of waste decomposer solution is added to a drum with 2 kg of jaggery and 20 liter water is added. Farmers can prepare continuously this solution from this waste decomposer for lifetime.

How to use?
Composting
Spread 1 ton of compost as layer on a plastic sheet placed under shade 
Sprinkle 20 liter of the above prepared solution over the compost layer 
Spread one more layer of compost above the existing layer 
Sprinkle 20 liter of the solution over the compost layer
 use the solution for 10 compost layers 
Maintain 60% moisture during entire period of composting 
Turn over the compost at 7 day interval the compost is ready to use after 30 days 

Foliar spray
Spray the preparation on the standing crop for 4 times at 10 days interval

Drip irrigation
Mix the preparation in water required for 1 acre and use it for drip irrigation.

In-situ composting of crop residue
Spray the preparation on the post-harvest stalks of crop plants of 1 acre land and leave it for decomposition.

Seed treatment
Wear gloves
Content of 1 bottle is thoroughly mixed with 30g jaggery and used to treat 20 kg seeds

After 30 min. The seeds are ready for sowing.

For regular disease control, spray the preparation on standing crop once in a month.
