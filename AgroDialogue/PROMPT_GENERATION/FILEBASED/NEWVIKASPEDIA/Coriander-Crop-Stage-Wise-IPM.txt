Coriander crop stage-wise ipm

 stage wise management activity

Pre-sowing

Common cultural practices: 

 deep ploughing of fields during summer to control nematodes population, to expose pupae, propagules of soil borne pathogens and weeds. 
 soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil-borne pests including weeds.
 timely and line sowing should be done. 
 field sanitation, rogueing 
 destroy the alternate host plants 
 soil test based application of manures and fertilizers.
 growing castor or marigold as a trap crop for the management of spodoptera.
 plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum for the management of mites and thrips.
 follow crop rotation of non-host crops like cereal crops for 3 years.
 adopt ecological engineering by growing the attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the field bunds.

Nutrients

 nutrients should be applied on the basis of soil test report and recommendation for particular agro climatic zone.
 apply 4-5 tons of farmyard manure or vermicompost @1.5- 2.0 t/acre at the time of last cultivation and incorporate in the soil 2 to 3 weeks before sowing.
 incubate trichoderma @ 500 g in 100 kg fym for 15 days prior to its application in one acre field

Weeds

 summer ploughing should be done in hottest month of the year (may â€“june) and soil solarization should be done with transparent polyethylene sheet or adopt stale seed bed in irrigated fields and allow the weed seeds to germinate. Then field is cultivated immediately before sowing of crop to destroy the germinating weed seeds.

Soil and seed borne pathogens, nematodes

Cultural control: 

 plant resistant varieties if nematodes are known to be present in the soil; check roots of plants mid-season or sooner if symptoms indicate nematodes.

Sowing

Nutrients

 seed inoculation with azotobacter (107 cfu per g) @ 5 g /kg seed and psb @ 8-10g/kg seed. 
 apply 12 kg of n, 16 kg p2o5 and 8 kg k2o per acre as a single basal dose in the black cotton soils.
 in light soils under irrigated conditions, apply 18kg of n, 12 kg of p2o5 and 12 kg of k2o as basal dose at the time of sowing.

Weeds

 always use certified and weed free seeds. 
 line sowing should be done to facilitate inter-culture operations.
 plant population should be maintained to its optimum right from its beginning to minimize the crop- weed competition. 
 or adopt soil .

Wilt, blight, root rot, nematodes and insects

Cultural control: 

 select healthy and disease free seeds. 
 use resistant /tolerant varieties. 
 over irrigation should be avoided to minimize the wilt.

Application of trichoderma harzianum/ viride and pseudomonas fluorescens for treatment of seed/seedling/planting materials in the nurseries and field application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).

Vegetative stage

Common cultural practices:

 provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop 
 avoid water stress and water stagnation conditions.
 enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when larval parasitoids are observed 

Common mechanical practices:

 collection and destruction of eggs, and larvae
 collect and destroy diseased and insect infected plant parts.
 use yellow sticky traps for whitefly and aphids and blue sticky trap for thrips @ 4-5 traps/acre.
 use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm 
 install pheromone traps @ 4-5 traps/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2- 3 weeks) 
 erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc.
 set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm 25 

Common biological practices: 

 conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
 augmentative release of natural enemies.

Nutrients 

 apply 12 kg of n/acre as top dressing at 30 days after sowing.
Micro nutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of particular nutrient, if required.

Weeds

 during early stages of growth, coriander plants grow very slow, hence weeding during this period is very essential to save the plants from weed competition.
 two hand hoeing should be done at 25 and 50 days after sowing to keep the field weed free before flowering.
 in rain fed crop, first weeding should be done at about 25-30 days after sowing and in irrigated crop about 30-35 days after sowing and second weeding at 50-60 days after sowing.
 thinning of plants should be done before first irrigation to maintain a spacing of 5 to 10 cm between plants.

Aphids

 see common cultural and biological practices.
 insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil or nske 5% are usually the best method of control
 always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.

Whitefly

 see common cultural and biological practices.

Indigo caterpillar

See common cultural and biological practices.

Mite

 see common cultural and biological practices.
 see management practices of aphids

Cutworm 

 see common cultural and mechanical practices.

 biological control:

 release of trichogramma sp. @ 20,000/acre.

Wilt, stem gall, stem rot

Cultural control:

 maintain the optimum moisture to minimize the stem gall. 
 see common cultural and biological practices.

Flowering/maturity stage

Nutrients

 micronutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of particular micronutrient.

Weeds

 left over weeds should be removed from the field to avoid further spread of weed seeds.

Thrips, seed chalcid fly

 see common cultural and biological practices.

White fly, aphids, caterpillar, other pests

 same as vegetative stage.

Stem gall, stem rot, wilt

 same as vegetative stage.

Grain mould, powdery mildews

Cultural control 

 harvesting of the mature crop should not be delayed to avoid powdery mildew attack.
Chemical control:

 sulphur 85% dp @ 6-8 kg/acre

Storage

Pest (khapra beetle) &amp; diseases

 store in gunny bags with moisture proof lining.
