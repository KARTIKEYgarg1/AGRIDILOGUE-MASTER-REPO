Nutrient deficiency symptoms in peach

Nitrogen

Stunted growth of plants with pale green to light yellow color (chlorosis) appearing first on older leaves. Depending on the severity of deficiency, the chlorosis results in the drying and dropping of the older leaves.

Correction measure: foliar spray of urea @ 1-2 % at fortnightly intervals.
