After transplanting mulching with locally available resources like paddy straw to prevent moisture loss and suppress weed growth.
Spraying with bio insecticides like neem oil; beauveria bassiana; metarhizium anisoplea, verticillium lecani should be done on need based basis depending upon the severity of infestation by insects. So also, the same with organic fungicides like blitox-50; bordeaux mixture 1% etc against diseases like leaf blight; leaf spot; downy mildew.
Making own biopesticides by using locally available neem leaves, garlic, tobacco etc.
Install yellow sticky traps @ 12/acre to monitor cabbage aphids.
Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring diamond back moth.
Mulching with paddy straw or any dry leaves can be done to increase soil temperature, conserve soil moisture especially during the dry periods.
For farmers that lacks source of irrigation, they can go for vegetables cultivation in fallow paddy fields with the raised and sunken bed system.
Harvested maize stalk should be used for mulching purpose in between the two rows of the french bean.

Fishery

Composite fish culture

Supplementary feed which comprises of rice bran and moc should be given in the ratio of 1:1. Feed may be given at 3-5% of the total weight of the stocked fish.
If seed is available partial harvesting can be done in the month of october depending on the growth of the fishes to marketable size.
Number of fishes harvested may be replenished by equal number of fingerlings.
Final harvesting is done by repeated netting and then by application of moc @2500kg/ha in case of perennial pond.

Common carp breeding

Collection and maintenance of brooders are started in the month of december.
Breeding in happa is conducted in the month of february to march clean the pond embankment and remove all weeds. If algal bloom develops in the pond, feeding and manuring should be temporarily stopped.
During cold weather (severe winter), feeding and manuring in the fishpond should be restricted.
Liming @ 65 kg/ha should be given once a month.
Partial harvesting about 25 % of the total stock can be done to avoid overcrowded.
Three to four months before the breeding season, the common carp brood fish are detached and stocked in segregated ponds (for male and female) to avoid the unwanted spawning.

Oyster mushroom

Growing of different species of oyster mushroom like pleurotus ostreatus; p. Djamor; p. Sajorcaju; p. Flabellatus etc is advocated from september onwards as the weather condition is highly congenial for mushroom production.
Moreover, consumption of mushroom boosts immunity in humans against biotic stress particularly viral infection including covid 19.
It also ensures income, employment, and livelihood security.

Self help group (shg)

Women members in shgs, should establish nutrition garden in each household to get fresh vegetables which are rich in vitamins and minerals to enhance immunity to combat covid19.
The vegetables like brinjal, capsicum, chilli, cucurbitaceous vegetable etc can be grown in kitchen garden/nutrition garden.
The members of shgs can also make mask, hand gloves, cotton clothes for family members and neighbouring community for safety from covid19 as well as additional income.
