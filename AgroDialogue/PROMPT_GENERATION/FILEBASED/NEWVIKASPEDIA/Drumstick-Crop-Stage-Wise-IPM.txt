Drumstick crop stage-wise ipm

 management activity

Pre-sowing

Common cultural practices: 

 deep summer ploughing 
 destroy the alternate host plants 
 avoid planting overlapping crops in adjacent area.

Nutrients

 apply fym or compost @ 7-8 kg per pit.
 in addition, basal dose of n: p: k in 350: 100: 200 g/pit should also be incorporated at the time of planting.

Weeds

 remove or incorporate previous crop residues before planting. 
 plan to grow suitable intercrops like legumes, ginger, tapioca etc

Soil borne fungus, resting stages of pests

 soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil borne pests.

Damping off
 cultural control:

 raise nursery in light soil with proper drainage
 burning farm trash on the surface of the beds. 
 sowing seed on raised beds of 6-8‚Äù high (15 cm). Use low seed rate of 650 g/40 sq mt.

Apply trichoderma viride/harzianum and pseudomonas fluorescens as seed/seedling/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).

Vegetative stage

Common cultural practices:

 collect and destroy crop debris
 collect and destroy disease infected and insect damaged plant parts 
 provide irrigation at critical stages of the crop
 avoid water logging 
 avoid water stress during flowering stage 
 judicious use of fertilizers 
 enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed 
 field sanitation

Common mechanical practices:

 collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae 
 handpick the older larvae during early stages (do not handpick hairy caterpillars with urticating hairs) 
 the infested shoots and seed capsules may be collected and destroyed 
 handpick the gregarious caterpillars (do not handpick hairy caterpillars with urticating hairs) and the cocoons which are found on stem and destroy them in kerosene mixed water.
 use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm
 erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc.
Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm

Common biological practices:

 conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
 augmentative release of natural enemies

Nutrient

 under low fertile soils top dressing of n @ 100 g/pit by soil incorporation should be done. 
 micronutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of particular nutrient. 

Weeds

 crop should be weed free up to 3 months by interculture and hand weeding.

Hairy caterpillar

Follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 

Mechanical control: 

 the larvae in groups on tree trunks killed by a burning torch/flame thrower

Budworm bark caterpillar

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices

Reproductive stage

Nutrients

 micronutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of particular nutrient.

Weeds

 remove all the weeds before seed formation to avoid further spread of weed seeds.

Pod fly

Cultural control: 

Collect and destroy all the fallen and damaged fruits 
 trap the adults using attractants such as citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, vinegar (acetic acid), dextrose or lactic acid 
 rake up the soil under the trees or plough the infested field to destroy puparia.

 biological control 

 spray nske 5% during 50% fruit set and 35 days late
