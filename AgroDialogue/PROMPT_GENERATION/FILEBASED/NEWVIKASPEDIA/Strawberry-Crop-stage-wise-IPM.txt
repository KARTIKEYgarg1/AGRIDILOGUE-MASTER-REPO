Strawberry crop stage-wise ipm

 managementactivity 

Pre planting

Common cultural practices: 

 timely planting should be done. 
 orchard sanitation, roguing 
 destroy the alternate host plants and weeds.
 apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. 
 grow the attractant, repellent, and trap crops around the orchard bunds. 
 growing tomato or marigold as a trap crop for the management of leaf miner 
 plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum for the management of mites and thrips.
 crop rotation with non-host crops

Nutrients

 apply 10 to 20 tonnes/ acre farmyard manure/ vermicomposting at the time of orchard preparation

Weeds

 the soil is ploughed during summer with a soil turning plough

Soil borne pathogens, nematodes, resting stages of insects

Biological control: 

 apply neem cake/pongamia cake @ 100 kg/acre or press mud @ 2 t /acre in soil at the time of last ploughing for reducing nematodes and soil dwelling pests.

Planting

Nutrients

 apply fertilizers based on the soil test report and recommendation for particular zone. Generally, 30-40 kg. N, 16-48 kg. P2o5 and 16-32 kg. K2o/ acre may be applied according to soil type and variety planted.
 full dose of phosphorus and half dose of potash is given at the time of planting by placing the fertilizer at a depth of 15 cm between the rows.

Weeds

 the orchard is kept weed-free at the time of planting by harrowing and ploughing. Intercultural practices continued till the straw / plastic mulch is applied.

Soil borne pathogens, nematodes, resting stages of insects

Cultural control: 

 use tolerant /resistant varieties 
 avoid overlapping planting 
 drip irrigation/judicious irrigation.

Bud and pre-bloom

Nutrients

Nitrogen is applied in two equal doses. First dose is given one month after planting and second dose is given at the time of flowering. Remaining half of potash is given at the time of flowering. Four foliar applications of liquid fertilizers (containing 0.5% n, 0.2 % p2o5 and 0.5 % k2o) during august to february are also recommended for all strawberry growing areas.

Weeds

 the orchard is kept weed-free by machine tool weeding or hoeing. 
 use straw or plastic mulch to suppress the weeds between the rows.

Red spider mite

Cultural control:

 regular orchard scouting be conducted.
 control weeds in and around the orchard.

 biological control:

 conduct surveys for conservation of natural enemies (predators) like ladybird beetle, green lace wings, phytoseiid mite, syrphid and observe p.d. Ratio.
 release ladybird beetle, green lace wings @ 2/plant

Alternaria leaf spot

Cultural control: 

 orchard scouting and vigilance regularly

Powdery mildew

Mechanical control: 

 clip off infested foliage and plant materials and destroy

Leaf spot

Mechanical control:

 remove and burn trash from the previous crop. 
 avoid overhead irrigation.

Red stele

Cultural control: 

 strawberries should not be planted in fields where red stele has occurred. 
 use only certified and resistant plants and select well-drained sites for strawberries.

Black root rot

Cultural control: 

 use certified plants.
 avoid poorly drained sites. 
 rotate planting sites and fumigate

Anthracnose (black spot)

Cultural control:

 fumigation of soil
Soil solariziation 
 crop rotation with non-host crops 
 wash all soil from plant crowns prior to planting 
 weed around plants regularly 
 plant only disease free transplants 
 do not use excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer

Angular leaf spot

Cultural control:

Use only certified planting stock 

 crop rotation and avoid overhead irrigation

Bloom

Nutrients

 nitrogen is applied in two equal doses. First dose is given one month after planting and second dose is given at the time of flowering. Remaining half of potash is given at the time of flowering. Four foliar applications of liquid fertilizers (containing 0.5% n, 0.2 % p2o5 and 0.5 % k2o) during august to february is also recommended for all strawberry growing areas

Weeds

 the orchard is kept weed-free by machine tool weeding or hoeing.
 use straw or plastic mulch to suppress the weeds between the rows.

Red spider mite

 same as bud or prebloom stage

Leaf roller

Cultural control: 

 hand clipping of rolled leaves in trails and destroy 
 regular monitoring

Root louse

Cultural control: 

 crop rotation with cowpea and legumes
 secure plants free from infestation
 dip the plants for some time in strong solution made by boiling stems or leaves of tobacco 

Biological control:

 application of neem cake

Aphids

Cultural control: 

 clip off the leaves infested with aphids.

 biological control: 

Conserve and augment predators like coccinellids, syrphids, green lace bug and parasitoids

Cut worms

Cultural control:

 weed control is paramount to preventing a serious cutworm problem. 
 prunning reduces overwintering larvae 

Mechanical control:

 installation of bird perches

Wilt

 follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices. 

Cultural control:

 avoid plantation of tomato, potato, pepper, brinjal and raspberry

Alternaria leaf spot

Cultural control: 

 avoid planting infected plants 
Monitoring: scouting during humid weather with frequent showering

Wilt

Cultural control: 

Monitoring: regular monitoring and surveillance

Alternaria leaf spot

Cultural control: 

 older leaves of the runner plants should be removed before the fruit set

Vine weevil

Root louse

Thrips

Cultural control: 

 monitor with sticky traps.
 crop rotation should be adopted to avoid the pest infestation, especially with legumes and cow pea 
 destroy refuse from the old orchards after harvest to reduce pest infestation 
 in hill system, renew the beds after harvesting of first fruiting season if pest population is there. If no problem is there maintain the orchard for 4-6 years old depending on profitability of crop

White grubs

Mechanical control:

 collection of destruction of adult beetles in soapy water
 good cultivation before planting will injure grubs and expose them to birds and the sun
 installation of light trap 
 leave one or two rows of strawberry plants to serve as a trap before plowing infested plantings under shortly after harvest
 rotate strawberry sites yearly with lettuce or cole crops 
 soil solarization

Gray mold

Cultural control: 

 avoid excessive use of nitrogen 
 avoid touching of berries on ground 
 regular monitoring 
 mulching, removal of debris and better air circulation between plants can help minimize losses.

Rodent

Cultural control: 

 orchard sanitation 
 community approach in control 
 sticky traps

White buds

Cultural control: 

 discard cultivating of all suspected plants and only healthy ones have to be used

Post-harvest

White grubs

Cultural control: 

 cultivation of strawberries in sod land should be avoided 
 avoid cultivation of strawberry beds near the trees as adults feed on them and lays the eggs 

Biological control: 

 application of neem cake

Root louse

Cultural control: 

 go for crop rotation in infested soils.
 plants should be free from infestation.
 dip plants for few minutes in tobacco solution (boil tobacco stem or leaves in water). 
 regular monitoring has to be done. 

Biological control: 

 apply neem cake in the orchard.

Nematode

Cultural control:

 starve the land for 2-3 years without any cultivation of any crop
 grow crops like oats, mustard, peanuts, cowpea, corn and velvet bean to reduce the population.
