Lentil crop stage wise ipm

Management
 
Activity

Pre-sowing

 

Common cultural practices:

Summer deep ploughing 
Follow crop rotation with non host crops 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Destroy the alternate host plants

Nutrients

Apply well decomposed fym @ 4-5 tons / acre incorporated with trichoderma 2-3 weeks before sowing

Weeds

Destroy weeds manually or by deep summer ploughing

Sowing

 

Common cultural practices:

Do summer ploughing 
Timely sowing should be done 
Solarize the field in summer to help reduce the inoculums. 
Use resistant varieties 
Select seed from disease free fields

Nutrients

Seed treatment should be done with rhizobium culture @ 200 g/ acre. 
Fertilizers should be applied on soil test basis. Generally, it is recommended to apply 8 to 10 kg n, 16 kg p2o5 , 8 kg k2o, 8 kg sulphur and 6 kg znso4 per acre at the time of sowing as basal application..

Weeds

Always use certified and weed free seeds. 
Timely sowing should be done. 
Line sowing should be done to facilitate inter-culture operations. 
Plant population should be maintained to its optimum right from its beginning to minimize the crop weed competition. 
Adopt suitable crop rotation to minimize dodder and orobanche weeds.

Pests, soil-borne pathogens

Deep ploughing of fields during summer to manage juvenile population of nematodes and insect pests. 
Soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 75 gauge thickness for six weeks before sowing to reduce the soil borne pests.

Vegetative

 

Common cultural practices:

Avoid excess application of nitrogen 
Adopt the ecological engineering strategy. 
Conserve natural enemies 
Remove and destroy weeds periodically 
Removal and destruction of infected/infested plants

Nutrients

Correct micronutrient deficiency if any in standing crop

Weeds

Keep field boundary &amp; bunds free from weeds. 
The crop field should be weed free initially for 4-5 weeks by following timely hoeing and weeding. 
Inter-culture operation/hoeing should be done twice at 20 and 35 days after sowing-using hand hoe to remove all weeds in between the row

Cow pea aphid

Mechanical control:

Use yellow sticky trap 

Biological control:

Conserve the predators such as syrphid flies, rove beetle, green lacewing, ladybird beetle and parasitoids such as aphidius spp. Aphelinus sp.

Cut worm

Biological control:

Conserve and augment the predators and parasitoids

Thrips

Cultural control:

Ploughing, harrowing and solarisation can kill pupae in the soil from previously infested crops. 

Mechanical control:

Adult thrips can be monitored by mass trapping with blue sticky traps or water pan traps in field. 

Biological control:

Conserve and augment the various biological control agents, including minute pirate bugs, orius spp., big eyed predatory bug, geocoris sp. And entomopathogenic nematodes,

Pod borers

Biological control:

Conserve and augment biocontrol agents.

Fusarium wilt and root rot diseases

Cultural control:

Use resistant varieties (pl 406, pl 639 and pl 234) 
Follow crop rotation weeds control 
Delayed sowing can reduce disease incidence 
Use of clean and certified seed. 
Deep ploughing over summer and removal of infected trash can reduce inoculum levels of fusarium wilt 

Mechanical control:

Solarisation of soil by covering the soil with transparent polythene sheet (75 gauge) for 6-8 weeks during the summer for effective management.

Lentil rust

Cultural control:

Use resistant varieties (pl 234, pl 406, ll 931, ll 699 and narendra masur-1)

Ascochyta blight

Cultural control:

Use of resistant cultivars (ll 699) 
Use of disease free seed, 
Follow crop rotation

Powdery mildew

Cultural control:

Use of resistant varieties

Mosaic virus

Cultural control:

Use of disease free seeds 

Mechanical control:

Use yellow sticky traps for vector monitoring

Reproductive

Nutrients

Incorporate crop residues in soil immediately after harvest

Aphids

Same as vegetative stage

Lygus bug

Cultural control:

Removal of weeds along field borders to prevent buildup of lygus bugs. 

Biological control:

Conserve and augment biocontrol agents

Cut worm and thrips

Same as vegetative stage
