Must use organic manures to maintain the fertility of soil.
In order to get maximum benefit of the fertilizers, always apply in root zone instead of broadcasting.
Resort to judicious and efficient use of phosphatic fertilizers for proper development of roots/shoots and timely maturity of crops, particularly the legumes which fix atmospheric nitrogen for enrichment of soil.
