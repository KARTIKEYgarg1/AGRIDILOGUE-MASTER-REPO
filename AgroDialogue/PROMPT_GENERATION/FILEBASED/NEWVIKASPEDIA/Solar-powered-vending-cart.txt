Solar powered vending cart

Current practices and problems

A number of urban poor are involved in vending with poor living conditions due to less income incurred due to loss of quality of the produce of quality . Vendors use wet gunny bags and/or sprinkle water. This leads to spoilage of produce particularly leafy vegetables due to direct water sprinkling, less shelf life for leafy ( one day) , tomato , cucumber and others ( 2 days.) and loss of income due to selling under compulsion and consumers disliking. A mobile vending cart (rehri) has been designed to store fresh fruits and vegetables safely for 2-5 days.

Further equipped with a portable energy bank of 7ah with the spv through charge controller and protection devices to meet energy requirement of any additional low power rating domestic gadgets.

 

Utility

Capable of reducing temperature of storage chamber by 5 -8°c and increase in relative humidity by 15 to 30 percent points.
