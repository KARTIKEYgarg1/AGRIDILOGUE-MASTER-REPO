Brooding management

Brooding management in deep litter system

Essential operations to be carried out prior to receiving chicks

Cleaning and disinfection of poultry house.
Spreading litter material.
Form a circle of about 5 feet diameter with brooder guard which can hold about 200 to 250 chicks.
News papers, heat source, feeder and waterer arrangements inside the brooder guard.
Spread ground maize or fine mash / crumble feed on the newspaper.
Check the brooder for proper temperature of 90 to 950 f.

Essential operations to be carried out after receiving chicks

After arrival of chicks, moist the beak and leave the chicks under heating source.
Maintain a brooder temperature of 90 to 950f for the first week and then reduce 50f every week until it reaches the room temperature.
First and second day provide electrolytes and vitamins in drinking water to overcome stress.
Watch the behaviour of chicks in order to find out whether temperature provided is correct or less or more.
In case of too much temperature, we can reduce the heat by reducing the power of the bulb or we can raise the heating element.
In case of too low temperature, we have to supplement more heating source or we can further down the heating element.
24 hours lighting programme may be adopted during 0-8 days of age.
One hour darkness may be provided to train the chicks in case of any power failure.
Remove the old newspaper after 3 days and destroy it by burning. If necessary, spread another set of newspaper.
Remove brooder guard after 7 to 10 days depending upon the season.
