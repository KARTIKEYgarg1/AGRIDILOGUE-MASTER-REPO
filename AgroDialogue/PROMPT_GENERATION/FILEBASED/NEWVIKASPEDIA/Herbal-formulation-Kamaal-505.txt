Herbal formulation kamaal 505

Innovator profile
Shri ishwar singh kundu (45) has developed a multi utility herbal formulation, which can be used as a bio-fertiliser, soil enhancer and as an insect pest control formulation for a variety of crops. His family consists of his mother, his wife and three young children all of whom are studying. Shri kundu's father was in military but later left the services to practice agriculture. He had around 70 acres of land but since their family was typically joint family, after partition his share came to be only 2 acres on which he today grows wheat and rice. He had his education in the village itself then after 10th moved to kaithal to do his iti course (1984-86). After the completion of the course he started looking for various jobs but could not find any. So he returned back in 1986 to his village to do agriculture. Along with his farming he kept on trying to get a job but as fate would have it he could not land up anywhere. So finally in 1988 he decided to set up a seed and pesticide shop at kaithal in partnership with another person. The work was fine but somehow things did not work out well between the two so he returned back to his home in 1992 establishing his workshop of agricultural repair where he mended small agricultural implements, pumps, etc. During the iti times he had some interest in journalism too and used to send articles to various newspapers etc. He even started a newsletter, `janta leader' in 1985 and continued its publication till 1992 with the help of his friends. Then during 1993-95 he shifted to faridabad again to work with an acquaintance of his. But had to return back again to his place after having another bitter experience. Then again he started his workshop of agricultural machinery, vacuum pumps, etc.

Innovation description
Excessive reliance on chemical fertilizers and their imbalanced use has affected soil health. The micronutrient deficiency in soil has increased. Organic carbon which is very essential to hold the important nutrients in the soil, has also decreased drastically. Loss of organic carbon can lead to reduction in soil fertility, land degradation and even desertification.

This is a “multi utility innovation” based on plant ingredients. It acts as growth promoter, fungicide, and termiticide. Due to its high organic content, it improves soil fertility, increases water intake and enhances water-holding capacity of the soil. Thus, it can also be used for soil reclamation.
