Sunflower-crop stage wise ipm

Managementactivity

Pre-sowing

Common cultural practices:

Deep ploughing during summer exposes the pests and weeds to high temperature and reduces their load present in the soil.
Crop rotation of 3-4 years reduces soil borne diseases 
Adopt timely sowing should be done.
Keeping field bunds and crop free of weeds to avoid high pest load as it favours the pest build up on the main crop.

Nutrients

Incorporate 3-4 t/acre of well decomposed fym or compost or crop residues treated with trichoderma 2-3 week prior to sowing.
Do not leave fym or compost exposed to sunlight as nutrients may be lost.
Apply adequate and balanced nutrients along with organics as per soil test basis.

Weeds

At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique i.e. Pre sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in field. Adopt integrated weed management to reduce weed competition.

Soil borne diseases (downy mildew, charcoal rot, sclerotium wilt, alternaria leaf spot, rust) and sunflower necrosis virus

Cultural control:

Uproot and burn infected plants early enough to avoid spread of the disease.
Effective weed control.
Maintain good fertility levels.
Place the seeds at a depth of 3 cm along the furrows in which the fertilizer mixture is placed and cover with soil. Put two seeds per hole at the rate of 1.6-2.8kg/acre based on irrigated and rainfed land.

Thrips

Cultural control:

Destroying queen by digging it out from the termitorium in red soil areas.

Nutrient management

For efficient use of applied fertilizers, adopt fertilizer cum seed drill.
Seed treatment should be done with azotobactor /azospirillum and psb @ 250 g /acre and vam inoculum @ 1kg /acre as soil application.
Fertilizers should be applied on soil test basis. Generally, it is recommended to apply npk @ 25, 20 and 16 kg /acre. ï‚· apply 50% of n and full dose of p &amp;k preferably in the form of band placement at the time of sowing.
Apply sulphur @10-15 kg/ acre through gypsum or single super phosphate (ssp).
