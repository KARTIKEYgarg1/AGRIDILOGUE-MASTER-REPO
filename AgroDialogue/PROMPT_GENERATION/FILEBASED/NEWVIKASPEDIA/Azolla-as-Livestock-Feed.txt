Accordingly, the plot of mrs. Khushi lepcha was identified as demonstration site. A group of villagers were trained on the subject matter.

Adoption of innovative technology, practices and achievements

The demonstration was conducted on a simple pond of 14’x14’x2’ dimension. Azolla pond was provided by food security and agriculture development department and the azolla seed was provided by , livestock, fisheries &amp; veterinary services department.
Training and technology demonstration was provided by atma, north sikkim district.
Harvesting of azolla was done in 15-25th day of starting and fed to cows. The villagers noticed marked improvement in milk yield, quality and overall health condition of animals. Azolla proved to be palatable to cows from eating behaviour as compared to other fodder.

From 14’x14’x2’ size pond production was 600 kg which was sold @ rs.20/kg. It earned rs.12,000/-. The total cost involved rs.3,000/- thus a profit of rs.9,000/- was earned.
