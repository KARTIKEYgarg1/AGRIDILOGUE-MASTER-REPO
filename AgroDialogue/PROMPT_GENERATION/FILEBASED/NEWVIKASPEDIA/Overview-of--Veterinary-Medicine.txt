Overview of veterinary medicine

Medicine is the science of treating diseases dealing with diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

Veterinary medicine includes combination of anatomy, physiology, pathology, parasitology, microbiology and pharmacology.

Branches of veterinary medicine

There are two branches of veterinary medicine

Clinical veterinary medicine - (internal medicine, curative medicine). Eg. Cardiologist, gastroenterologist etc
Preventive veterinary medicine - maintain health and prevent and control animal diseases.

Classification of disease

Hereditary- transmitted to the offspring through mother or father. eg. Haemophilia.
Congenital - disease acquired during intrauterine life eg. Atresia anai, tb
Acquired disease- contracted during the entire life span. Eg. Cataract

According to specific cause

Specific- produced by specific pathogen. Eg. Rp, fmd
Infectious- living infecting organism eg virus, bacteria, protozoa

According to system involved

Localized- confined to a particular spot eg. Abscess
Generalized- all parts of the body eg. Toxaemia, septicaemia

According to changes in the organ

Structural- change in structure eg. Pericarditis, rickets, osteomalacia
Functional- change in function without altering structure eg. Arrhythmia

Stages of infectious disease

Incubation period
Premonitary symptoms
Stages of development
Subsidence
Covalescence

According to clinical manifestation

Acute- sudden onset, severe, short course, 3 to 14 days. Eg. Rp, anthrax, fmd
Per acute- duration is shorter than acute with very severe course. Illness lasts for few hr to 48hr. Eg. Peracurte mastitis
Sub acute- onset and severity is less than the acute one. 2-4 wks
Chronic disease- long run, fatal. Illness over 4 wks. Tb

According to spread of disease

Sporadic- spread in the herd
Endemic- disease retained in the herd for a long time in a locality affecting large number of animals
Enzootic- among animals in a definite area
Epizootic disease- large population
Panzootic disease-epidemic disease reaches some unusual size in another country

According to source of infection

Exogenous- animal gets infected from other animals, foodstuffs
Endogenous- auto-infection activation of microorganism due to disturbance of internal medium resp. Tract infection.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis is the art of recognition and determination of the nature of disease

Classification of diagnosis

Snap shot diagnosis - declared at very approach, erroneous
Direct- observing lesions
Tentative- based on subjective changes, laboratory tests
Symptomatic- based on pathological changes
Differential- comparing
Exclusion 
Confirmatory â€“ clinical, biochemical, pathological and immunological
Herd diagnosis- affected animal shows clear symptoms. Search the environment where the animals are kept in pasture , housing conditions, grazing etc., post mortem, pathological findings, all supervision of experts from various disciplines. 

Other terminologies

Typical symptom- typical of the disease
Syndrome- associated to the disease
Lesion- structural changes in an organ
Prophylactic measures- prevent the spread of disease thru quarantine, vaccination, disposal, nutrition
Prognosis- forecast disease. Favourable, doubtful, poor, grave
Relapse- reoccurrence of the disease

Why veterinary clinicians face problems while making a diagnosis

Animals cannot express so we have to depend upon our own observations
Diagnosis becomes erroneous when we have to depend upon attendants
Sometimes animals do not cooperate
Different species of animals have different structures and functions
Variation in normal physiology (temp, pulse, respire) in different species of animal
