Jackfruit crop stage wise ipm

Management
 
Activity

Pre-planting

 

Common cultural practices: 

Deep ploughing of orchard immediately after harvest to expose eggs and pupae of mealy bugs. 
Heavy irrigation of orchard in october also helps in destruction of eggs of mealy bug. 
After removing the webs of bark eating caterpillars following measures should be adopted:
All the borer holes except the fresh one, should be plugged with mud plastering.

Nutrients

Dig pits of 1 m x 1 m x 1 m. 
Fill up the pits with top soil mixed with 10 kg of fym and 1 kg of neem cake per pit

Weeds

Summer deep ploughing to destroy stubbles, rhizomes of perennial weeds.
Ploughing the field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the field.

Planting

 

Common mechanical practices: 

Remove new sprouts emerging from root stock at frequent intervals. 
Shift the grafts frequently from one place to another to prevent them from striking roots into the ground.

Nutrients

Transplant the saplings / planting materials in pits already prepared and filled with manures

Weeds

Before transplanting, pits and surrounding area should be free from weeds

Pests, soil-borne pathogens

Cultural control:

Nursery beds should be raised.
Nursery beds should be fumigated with 4% formalin

Vegetative (1-5 years onward)

 

Common cultural practices: 

Collect and destroy tree debris 
Collect and destroy disease infected and insect damaged plant parts
Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed
Provide timely irrigation, organic manure, fertilizer as per the recommended dose, drainage, weeding, mulching, intercultural operation etc. 

Common mechanical practices: 

After mud plastering 25 cm. Wide, 400 gauge alkathene (polythene) should be fastened to the tree trunk with the help of sutli, about 30 cm. Above the ground level to prevent migration of freshly hatched first instars nymphs of mealy bugs in the month of december-january. 
The affected leaves and young shoots may be pruned and they may be destroyed along with the pest. This practice will help in bringing down the pest population. 
Prune and burn affected twigs for the control of scales and mealy bugs. Sticky band should be fixed on main trunk to prevent the movement of ants. 
The affected parts should be nipped off and destroyed. 

Common biological practices:

Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 
Augmentative release of natural enemies.
Ladybird beetle, adalia sp, synharmonia sp, exochomus sp, stethorus sp @ 30-50 adults/infested tree.
Lacewing and syrphus sp. @ 10-20 first instar larvae/tree

Nutrients

The manures and fertilizers should be applied in two splits during may - june and september – october on the basis of soil test report or in general as per schedule

Weeds

Keep the pits and surrounding areas weed-free by hand tool weeding. 
Use straw or plastic mulch to manage the weeds and conserve the soil moisture in the tree basins. 
Grow the annual or perennial recommended intercrops like corn, vegetables (e.g. Okra, brinal, chilli, tomato etc.), citrus, banana, pineapple etc. Or cover crops like pulses (e.g. Green gram, bengal gram etc.) and groundnut. 
Whenever intercrops are not grown between the rows, slashing and mowing of weed may be adopted.

Shoot and fruit borer

Cultural control: 

Attacked shoots should be clipped off and destroyed. 
Clean hole and pour kerosene/petrol/crude oil or formalin into the stem borer hole and subsequently close entrance of the tunnel by plugging with cotton wool and paste the mud.
Use light trap@1/acre 

Physical control: 

To protect them from egg laying, fruit may be covered with polythene bags and the affected parts removed and destroyed.

 botonical control: 

Spraying neem oil may be recommended.

Spittle bugs

Cultural control: 

Keep orchard clean and healthy. 
Cut dried branches 

Physical control: 

Light, accessible spittlebug infestations can be removed by hand or by a strong water spray. 
Cut dried branches 

Biological control: 

Pipunculid fly, verrallia virginica caused 50-60% parasitism of adult spittlebugs. 

Mealybug

Cultural control: 

Flooding of orchard with water in the month of october kill the eggs.
Ploughing of orchard in november.
Raking of soil around tree trunk to expose the eggs to natural enemies and sun, removal of weeds
Fastening of alkathene sheet (400 gauge)/grease band of 25 cm wide afterwards mud plastering of trunk at 30 cm above the ground in the middle of december.
In july –august destruction of infested fallen leaves with scales 

Biological control: 

Raking of soil around tree trunk to expose the eggs to natural enemies and sun, removal of weeds and releasing 10-15 grubs
Releasing 10-15 grubs of cocinellid predator, c. Montrozieri per tree.

Bud weevil

Physical control:

Remove the infested shoots, flower buds and fruits to check infestation. 

Biological control:

Pipunculid fly, verrallia virginica caused 50-60% parasitism of adult spittle bugs. 

Bark eating caterpillar

Cultural control: 

Remove and destroy dead and severely affected branches of the tree 
Remove alternate host, silk cotton and other hosts

Aphid

Physical control: 

Collect and destroy the damaged plant parts along with nymphs and adults

Biological control: 

Release coccinellid predators

Pink waxy scale

Cultural control: 

Prune heavily infested plant parts to open the tree canopy and destroy’ them immediately. 
Prune infested parts (branches and twigs) preferably during summer. 
These should be placed in a pit constructed on one corner of the orchard. Allow branches and twigs to dry until the parasites escape. 
Burn the remaining debris. 
Removal of attendant ants may permit natural enemies to control the insect.

Leaf webber

Physical control:

Mechanical clipping and burning of affected shoots 

Biological control: 

Release of pupal parasitoid, tetrastichus howardi @20,000 / ac.
Release of egg parasitoid, trichogramma chilonis @ 2cc / ac.

Thrips

Cultural control:

Spraying strong jet of water to dislodge and wash out the pest

Castor capsule borer

Cultural control: 

Prune heavily infested plant parts to open the tree canopy and destroy’ them immediately 

Biological control:

The natural enemies, hexamermis spp and apanteles taragammae have been found to be potential bio-control agents of the pest.

Dieback

Cultural control: 

Every care should be taken to prevent introduction of disease in newly planted orchards. 

Mechanical control:

Any infected portion should immediately be pruned, followed by spraying/ pasting of copper oxychloride or pasting with cow dung at the cut ends. 
Pruning should be done in such a way that some healthy portion is also removed, to ensure complete eradication of pathogen (3 ―below the infection site).

Leaf spot

Cultural control:

Affected branches should be pruned

Rust

Cultural control: 

Affected branches should be pruned

Anthracnose

Follow common cultural, mechanical and biological practices 

Cultural control: 

Diseased leaves, twigs, gall midge infected leaves and fruits, should be collected and burnt. 
Covering the fruits on tree, 15 days prior to harvest with news or brown paper bags.

Pink disease

Cultural control: 

Pruning of infected branches

Reproductive*

Nutrients

Micronutrient deficiency, if any, should be corrected by application of particular nutrients.

Weeds

Use straw or plastic mulch to manage the weeds and conserve the soil moisture in the tree basins.
Keep the pits and surrounding areas weed-free by hand tool weeding. 
Whenever intercrop(s) not grown between the rows of trees, slashing and mowing of weed may be adopted.

Anthracnose, dieback, pink disease

Same as vegetative stage

Soft rot or fruit rot,

Physical control: 

Remove affected fruits.

Maturation *

Stem borer, shoot and fruit borer, pink waxy scale, thrips, aphid, castor capsule borer

Same as vegetative stage

Post harvest

Anthracnose

Physical control: 

Hot water treatment at 52 0c for 4-5 min. 
Fruits should be sprayed with the mixture of bioinoculants.
