Spittlebugs

Symptoms
In early spring and summer, masses of white foamy substance develop on young stems and leaves of plants. Each white mass contains a small 4-6 mm and not yet fully developed insect of white-creamy colour. Usually plant growth is unaffected, but, if the pest has been feeding at the shoot tip, this may cause growth problems.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Biological control does not exist for this minor pest. If it is needed, remove them physically by hand.
Chemical Control
Insecticides are not needed to control froghoppers and spittlebugs. Pesticides are not effective against spittlebugs because the nymphs are protected inside the foamy substance and won't be affected by the spray.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by spittlebugs which suck plant juices. They usually don't cause much damage, but if their numbers grow, they can become a problem. They create the foamy substance to protect from predators. Spittlebugs have three parts to their life cycle: egg, immatute stage, adult. Each stage can last up to half a year. When the eggs hatch, the young insects feed on the plant. During their following phase, they produce the foam to protect themself and keep growing until they become adults. In order to develop, the immature stage moves around the plant feeding on different parts of the plant for 1-3 months. Adult spittlebugs usually lay eggs in plant debris or in leaves and stems. Each female spittlebug lays around 100-200 eggs. They overwinter as eggs on plants. Immature stage is usually of green colour. Before developing into adults, the colour of the body darkens and wings start to develop. Spittlebugs prefer to feed on legumes and other nitrogen-fixing plants.

Preventive Measures 
To get rid of spittlebugs, you can use a strong blast of water to wash away the foam and shake the bugs off the plant.
Clean up your field after the growing season ends to reduce overwintering eggs.
In the spring, check for any spittlebugs on weeds and get rid of them before the bugs can spread to your crops.
