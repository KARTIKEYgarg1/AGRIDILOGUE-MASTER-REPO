American Gooseberry Mildew

Symptoms
An off-white fungal covering grows on the leaves, fruits and shoot tips of the gooseberry. On currant plants, the leaves of the shoot tips exhibit an off-white fungal covering on the underside that can also extent to the upper side. The results can be early leaf fall and reduced shoot growth.

Product Recommendations

Cut back infected shoots. Use milk-water solutions, which function as natural fungicides (you can find tips in the main menu - information on plant diseases - preventive plant protection). Apply this solution every other day to the leaves.
Chemical Control
Fungicides with Sulfuric , Difenoconazole and Azoxystrobin can be used.
