Cassava Gall Midge

Symptoms
Galls are formed on the plants by the feeding activities of the larvae. Galls are mostly found on the upper side of leaves, where the flies lay their eggs and less frequently on buds and stems. Galls are yellowish-green to red and are conical in shape. When galls open, a cylindrical tunnel with or without the larva is seen inside the gall. If galls are observed from underneath the leaf, a small hole is noticeable through which the adult midge emerges.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Use colour traps for monitoring or mating disruption.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with available biological treatments.

What caused it?
The damage is caused by the Jatrophobia brasiliensis. The flies are tiny flying insects that lay their eggs on the leaf surface. When the eggs are hatched, the emerging larvae induce abnormal cellular growth, which forms on the upper surface of the leaf.

Preventive Measures 
Where possible, plant in dry areas.
Establish fields in open locations and space plants to allow adequate ventilation.
Control weeds beneath and around plants.
Remove all fallen leaves from fields and burn or bury them.
