Groundnut Chlorotic Fan-spot Virus

Symptoms
The symptoms occur in the leaves and fruit, with a few cases of stem necrosis. The major symptoms are ringspots (including chlorotic, yellow, necrotic, and zonate spots), bud necrosis, silver mottle, and vein banding. Symptoms vary between disease stages but chlorotic, yellow, and necrotic ring spots can occur at all stages (early, middle, and late).

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Practice proper crop rotation with non-host crops. The release of predatory mites, mirids, and other natural enemies can control the vector population. Introduce beneficial microorganisms to the soil environment to help plants enhance disease resistance. Use yellow or blue sticky plates to attract and trap the vector insects, such as thrips.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and available biological treatments. Foliar insecticides are often ineffective in controlling thrips (vector) under field conditions due to their ability to develop insecticidal resistance.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by GCFSV, genus Orthotospoviruses that is transmitted by thrips. The virus can also be transmitted through seeds or seedlings infected by the virus. Weeds also provide potential conditions for secondary infection and virus outbreaks in the field.

Preventive Measures 
Seedlings are highly susceptible to viral infection and so avoid infection during the seedling stage.
Seedlings should be grown in greenhouses with insect-proof netting or maximal barrier precautions to control thrips effectively, thus preventing viral damage.
