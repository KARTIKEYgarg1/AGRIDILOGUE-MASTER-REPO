Bagrada Bug

Symptoms
Leaves, stems, flowers show feeding damage. Feeding by the adult leaves white scars on both sides of the leaves. Thinner leaves may develop papery, whitish patches. Infected plants show signs of wilting, yellowing, and drying of the leaves. The growing points of the plant can die, and young plants may succumb to the attack, resulting in death. The damage can also affect harvested crops. These crops can grow small, unmarketable heads or no heads at all (referred to as "blind" plants). Both adult bugs and nymphs extract sap from all plant parts. The adults also release a sticky substance that spoils the crop.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Several insects can parasitise the eggs of Bagrada hilaris, like Gryon, Ooencyyrtus, Telenomus and Trissolcus. The adult bugs are parasitised by flies and spiders. Soap solution sprays have also been found effective against the pest. Mix chilli, soap, garlic and paraffin and spray it on your crops.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Sow imidacloprid-treated seeds. Use contact foliar insecticides on young seedlings during the afternoon and early evening. Pyrethroids, pyrethrins, neonicotinoids, and organophosphate have been effective against this pest.

What caused it?
The damage is caused by the adults and the juvenile form (nymph) of Bagrada hilaris, otherwise known as Bagrada or Painted bug. The adult insect is black and has white and orange markings on its body, which is shaped like a shield. It measures about 5-7 millimeters. The insects lay their eggs in groups on leaves or in the soil near the plants. Initially, the young insects have no wings and are bright orange. As they grow, they turn red and develop dark markings until they look like the adult form. The insects mainly affect plants from the Brassica family, such as cabbage, cauliflower, and kale. These plants often suffer from heat and lack of water. The bugs harm the plants by sucking the sap from the leaves and infesting them in large numbers.

Preventive Measures 
Before planting monitor your field and surrounding areas for this pest.
After planting continue the monitoring during the warm parts of the day regularly.
Only plant clean, non-infested transplants.
Protective covers like a fine net material can be used to protect the seedlings.
Remove crop residues and weeds from your field and destroy them.
