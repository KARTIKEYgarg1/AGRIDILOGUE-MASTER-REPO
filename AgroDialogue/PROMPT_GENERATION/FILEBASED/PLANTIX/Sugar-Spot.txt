Sugar Spot

Symptoms
The symptoms will appear after the banana harvest. Initially, small dark spots develop on the banana peel, which can enlarge over time. Brown spots can also be observed on fruit flesh.

What caused it?
The symptoms are caused by the natural ripening process of bananas. They continue to ripen even after they are harvested. The spots are signaling that starch is processed to sugar, implying that a large number of brown spots would mean a high level of sugar. The enzyme polyphenol oxidase or tyrosinase interacting with oxygen are thought to cause the brown coloration. The hormone ethylene reacts with the fruit's acids and breaks them down, resulting in the softening of the banana. The natural browning and softening process are even more obvious when the fruit becomes bruised.

Preventive Measures 
To slow down the browning process, keep your harvested fruits in dark and dry locations.
Do not store bananas with other fruits that produce ethylene like apples or tomatoes.
It is not advised to store them in a cool environment like a fridge.
