Papaya Mosaic Virus

Symptoms
Symptoms of infection are concentrated in young leaves and include a mild leaf mosaic pattern and a slight deformation. Dark green blister-like patches appear on otherwise yellowish-green leaf blades. At later stages of the disease, leaf veins can show signs of clearing, petioles are somewhat shorter and leaves curl downward while adopting an upright position. Other plant parts (stems, flowers) are not affected. Plants show a moderately stunted growth, something that only becomes apparent when directly compared to healthy plants.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Disinfect working tools or heat them in an oven at 150Â°C for 1 hour to kill the virus. Working tools or gloves can also be dipped in 0.525% sodium hypochlorite and then rinsed in water.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological measures if available. There is no chemical treatment for viral infections.

What caused it?
The virus affects papayas as well as other crops, for example, those of the cucurbit family. It is spread from plant to plant by mechanical injuries. Another way of disease transmission is through grafting with infected planting material. It is often associated with other viral diseases and symptoms can vary slightly in those cases. This virus is actually of minor importance in papaya but if the right conditions are met, it can lead to yield losses.

Preventive Measures 
Plant seeds or seedlings from healthy plants or from certified sources.
Rotate with non-host crops.
Beware of carrying infected soil or plant material to uninfected fields.
Spot, remove and destroy infected plants or plant parts.
Disinfect your tools and equipment with heat or other methods.
Keep hands and clothes clean and wear gloves.
