Pomegranate crop stage wise ipm

Management
 
Activity

Pre planting*

 

Common cultural practices: 

Timely planting should be done. 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Destroy the alternate host plants
Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations 
Sow the ecological engineering plants
Sow the intercrops as per the season. 
Sow/plant sorghum/maize/pearl millet in 4 rows all around the crops as a guard/barrier crop. 

Nutrients 

Pits are dug 60-75 cm3 before the onset of monsoon. The pits are filled with 20-25 kg of fym or compost, 1 kg of super phosphate. The plants are planted usually in square or hexagonal system. 
The distance of planting in case of many improved varieties is 5.0 x 4.0 m. 
For higher yields during the first 4-5 years after planting, a distance of 5 x 2 m may be adopted and alternate plants may be removed afterwards maintaining a planting distance of 5 x 4 m. 

Weeds 

Weeds should be removed from the field to avoid further spread of weed seeds 

Soil-borne pathogens, and resting stages of insects 

Cultural control: 

Deep summer ploughing of fields to exposes dormant stages (pupa and larva) and subsequently reduces their initial population build up 
Soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before planting for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil-borne pests including weeds. 
Ploughing in inter- space. 

Bacterial leaf spot 

Cultural control: 

Proper plant &amp; row spacing 
Selection of disease free seedlings for fresh planting 
Use of plenty of organics + micronutrients + recommended npk 

Planting* 

 

Common cultural practices: 

Use resistant/tolerant planting material/seedlings 
Use healthy, certified and weed free planting material. 
Follow proper plant spacing 

Nutrients 

One year old plants should be applied about 10 kg of fym and 150 to 200 grams of ammonium sulphate. This amount is increased every year, so that a five year old plant gets 50 kg fym and 1 kg of ammonium sulphate.the adult bearing trees are applied with 675g of nitrogen, 250g each of phosphorous and potash. 

Weeds 

Remove weeds before planting. 

Soil-borne pathogens, and resting stages of insects 

Cultural control: 

Clean cultivation: for healthy growth keep basin clean. 
Soil health: avoid water logging, keep soil raked and aerated, to reduce invasion of shot hole borer. 
Detection of pest: the infestation should be detected periodically by looking out for drying branches. 
Moderate to heavy pruning to remove disease affected, broken, crisscross branches, water sprouts, suckers and opening canopy to improve light penetration. 

Mechanical control: 

Uproot infested trees: infested young plants should be uprooted and burnt. 

* apply trichoderma viride/ harzianum and pseudomonas fluorescens as seed/seedling/planting material, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required). 

Vegetative stages 

 

Common cultural practices: 

Collect and destroy crop debris 
Provide irrigation at the critical stages of the crop 
Avoid water logging 
Avoid water stress during flowering stage 
Follow judicious use of fertilizers 
Enhance parasitic activity by avoiding chemical pesticide spray, when 1-2 larval parasitoids are observed in the crops field.

Common mechanical practices: 

Collect and destroy disease infected and insect infested plant parts 
Collect and destroy eggs and early stage larvae 
Handpick the older larvae during early stages 
Use yellow sticky traps @ 4-5 trap/acre 
Use light trap @ 1/acre and operate between 6 pm and 10 pm 
Install pheromone traps @ 4-5/acre for monitoring adult moths activity (replace the lures with fresh lures after every 2-3 weeks) 
Erecting of bird perches @ 20/acre for encouraging predatory birds such as king crow, common mynah etc. 
Set up bonfire during evening hours at 7-8 pm. 

Common biological practices: 

Conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering 25 
Augmentative release of natural enemies 

Nutrients 

Irrigation interval may vary from 1-3 days depending upon weather condition, age of plant, crop stage, soil type etc. 
Provide less irrigation during new leaf emergence and flower development stages as excess water during these stages may lead poor flowering. 
Apply npk@ 170-40-40g/tree and fym@ 10kg/tree if the crop age is 3years, npk@ 170-40-85g/tree and fym @ 15kg/tree crop age is 4 years, npk @ 210-85-85 g/tree and fym @ 20kg/tree crop age is above 5years. 
Along with recommended dosage of npk and fym apply neem cake 0.5kg + vermicompost 1.5kg + calcium ammonium nitrate 50g/tree in circular trench (15-20 cm wide of 8-10cm depth) at 45-60cm apart from the stem, cover the trenches properly with soil and start irrigation.
