Onion: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre-sowing *

Nutrients
• before sowing, soil testing should be done to find out the soil fertility status. Nutrient should be provided as per soil test recommendations. • add well rotten fym @ 10 t/acre or vermi compost @ 4 t/acre. Incorporate fym at the time of field preparation at 2 to 3 weeks before transplanting. Vermicompost should be incorporated one week before transplanting.

Weeds
• deep ploughing during summer. • at the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique or soil solarization to minimize the weeds menace in field. • the boundary &amp; bunds of the field should be free from weeds. • keep the nursery weeds free by manual weeding. 

Soil borne pathogens, nematodes, and resting stages of insects
Cultural control: • deep ploughing of fields during summer to control juveniles and adults of nematodes, and control the overwintering stages. • soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarisation which will help in reducing the soil borne pests.

Damping off
Cultural control: • avoid excessive watering • use raised beds: more than 15 cm height is better for water drainage

Sowing / planting*

Nutrients
• biofertilizers: seed/seedling treatment with azotobacter and psb cultures @ 240 g each/acre seed/ seedling. • apply npk fertilizers @ 40: 20: 40 kg/acre. Apply 1/3 of n, entire p and 60 % k as basal dose at the time of planting. • based on soil test for micronutrient, the deficient micronutrient should be applied in soil at sowing / transplanting.

Weeds
• in high weed infested fields, apply approved herbicides as mentioned below; • spray oxyflourfen 23.5% ec @ 170-340 ml in 200-300 l of water/ acre on soil as pre-plant application or quizalofop-ethyl 5% ec @ 300-400 ml 150-180 l of water/acre 20 days after planting of onion seedlings followed by one hand weeding if required.

Vegetative stage

Nutrients
• apply 1/3 of n at 21days and remaining 1/3 at 45 days after transplanting. • apply remaining 40 % potash as top dressing in standing crop at 21 days after transplanting. • micronutrient application may be made after soil test.

Weeds
• the crop should be maintained weed free initially for 30-45 days by following timely intercultural and hand weeding if required.

Onion thrips
Cultural control: • use resistant/tolerant varieties. • practice field sanitation. • avoid successive planting of garlic or other preferred/alternate host such as cabbage, cotton, tomato, cucumber, melons, pumpkins, strawberries etc. • plant the new crop in upwind direction of already planted crop which help in escaping infestation from old planting to some extent in the initial stages. • adjust the transplanting dates • use of reflective plastic silver colour and aluminium painted black mulches repel the thrips (seed crop) • use of sprinkler irrigation reduces thrips population considerably compared to drip and surface irrigation • plant two rows of maize or inner row of wheat and outer row of maize surrounding the onion plots as barrier crop (national horticultural mission 2012) biological control: • conserve parasitoids such as ceranisus menes (nymph) etc. • conserve predators such as syrphid fl ies, minute pirate bug/ anthocorid bug (blaptosthethus sp, buchananiella whitei, orius tantilus), praying mantis, predatory thrips (aeolothrips fasciatum), damselbug, lacewings, coccinellids (cheilomenes sexmaculata), spiders etc. Chemical control: • spray dimethoate 30% ec @ 264 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or oxydemeton methyl 25% ec @ 480 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or quinalphos 25% ec @ 480 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre or lambda cyhalothrin 5% ec @ 120 ml in 120-160 l of water/acre. • use high pressure and volume for good coverage of the crop and direct the nozzle at base of leaves • add a spreader or sticker (0.05-1.0%) for retention and spread of spray fluid on erect leaves of onion. • in seed crop, thrips should be controlled well before flowers open.
