Soybean Mosaic Virus

Symptoms
Plants can be infected at any time. Resistant varieties show no apparent symptoms. In susceptible plants, the early stage of the infection is characterized by the development of a light and dark-green mosaic pattern in young, rapidly growing leaves. Later they become severely mottled, wrinkled along the veins and curl downward. Defoliation, plant stunting, and reduced pod number and size ensue. Symptoms are most severe during cool weather and may not be detectable at temperatures above 32Â°C.

Organic Control
Sorry, we don't know of any alternative treatment against SMV . Please get in touch with us in case you know of something that might help to fight this disease. Looking forward to hearing from you.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatment if available. Chemical treatment of viral diseases is not possible. The use of insecticides to control aphid population, and thereby the spreading of the virus, is not effective.

What caused it?
The virus has a large range of hosts, which include peas, sneap beans, and many weeds. The pathogen is transmitted by aphids, infected seeds and can survive in nearby hosts. Infection in the early growth stages can cause yield loss, affect seed quality, and reduce seed germination and nodulation. Infections that occur later in the season are less severe. Well-fertilized fields with high yield potential and high aphid density favor virus transmission.

Preventive Measures 
Be sure to use certified, virus-free seeds.
Use resistant or tolerant varieties.
If possible, choose early planting programs.
Do not rotate soybean with other hosts of the virus.
Control weeds in an around the fields.
Do not over-fertilize your fields during early stages of plant growth.
