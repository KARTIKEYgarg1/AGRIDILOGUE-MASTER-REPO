Tomato: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre-sowing*

Nutrients
• add well rotten farm yard manure (fym) @ 8-10 t/acre or vermicompost @ 5 t/ acre. Incorporate at the time of field preparation at 1 week (vermicompost) or 2 to 3 weeks (fym) before transplanting.

Weeds
• at the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to minimize the weeds menace in field. • keep the nursery weed free by hand pulling of the weeds.

Soil-borne fungus and nematodes, resting stages of insects
Cultural control: • deep summer ploughing of fields to control nematodes and exposes dormant stages (pupa and larva) of helicoverpa and spodoptera and subsequently reduces their initial population build up • soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil-borne pests including weeds. • ecological engineering of tomato with raising african marigold nursery 15 days prior to tomato nursery serves as a trap crop for ovipositing females of helicoverpa. • apply neem cake @ 100 kg/acre.

Damping off
Cultural control: • excessive watering and poorly drained areas of field should be avoided • use raised beds: 15 cm height is better for water drainage or use pro-trays for raising seedlings biological control: • seed treatment with trichoderma viride 1 % wp @ 9 g/kg of seed. Chemical control: • seed treatment with captan 75% ws @ 20-30 g/kg seed • soil drench with captan 75% wp @ 1000 g in 400 l of water/acre

Seed sowing/ transplanting stage*

Nutrients
• before sowing, soil testing should be done to find out the soil fertility status. Nutrients should be provided as per soil test recommendations. Generally, tomato needs 40: 24: 24 kg n: p: k/acre-for varieties and 60: 36: 36 kg n: p: k/acre-for hybrids. • in varieties- apply 50% of n fertilizer dose as basal before transplanting. • apply entire dose of phosphatic fertilizers at the time of last ploughing/transplanting in case of varieties. • for hybrids, apply nitrogen fertilizer in three equal split doses. First at the time of last ploughing. • for hybrids, apply potassic fertilizers in two equal splits, first at the time of last ploughing. • based on soil test for micronutrients, the deficient micronutrient should be applied in soil at sowing/transplanting. • biofertilizers: for seed/seedling treatment with azotobacter and phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (psb) cultures @ 8-10 g each/kg seed • for seedling root dip treatment with azotobacter and phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (psb) cultures @ 250 g each/acre seedlings

Seed and seedling*

Weed management
• keep the nursery beds weed free by hand weeding. • avoid carrying of weed seedlings along with tomato seedlings • cultural practices such as crop rotation, line transplanting, intercropping should be adopted to avoid weeds spread and to suppress the weed growth.

Bacterial leaf spot
Chemical control: • spray streptomycin sulfate 9% + tetracycline hydrochloride 1% sp solution (streptocycline) 40-100 ppm in fields after the appearance of first true leaves. Two sprays, one before transplanting (seed beds) and another after transplanting (main field)

Fusarium wilt
Biological control: • seed treatment with trichoderma viride 1% wp @ 9 g/kg seed • root zone application: mix thoroughly 2.5 kg of the t. Viride 1% wp in 150 kg of compost or farmyard manure and apply this mixture in the field after sowing/ transplanting of crops

Leaf curl
Cultural control: • raising nursery in protected condition (with net of sufficient mesh size to prevent the entry of vector, whitefly) • seeds from disease free healthy plants should be selected for sowing. • in the nursery all the infected plants should be removed carefully and destroyed. Seedlings infected with the viral disease should not be used for transplanting. Chemical control: • before transplanting dip the roots of seedlings for 15 minutes in imidacloprid 17.8 % sl @ 60-70 ml in 200 l of water/acre for management of leaf curl vector.
