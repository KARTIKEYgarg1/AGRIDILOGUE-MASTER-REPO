Mustard: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre planting*

Nutrients
• apply fym @ 4.0 t/acre or vermicompost @ 2.0 t/acre. • incorporation of mustard residue (1 t/acre) + sesbania green manuring enhances the mustard yield in the long run. • seed treatment should be done with azotobactor culture @ 240 g/acre.

Weeds
Cultural control • deep ploughing during summer • at the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to minimize the weeds menace in field. • in stale seed bed technique field is irrigated prior to sowing and weed seeds are allowed to germinate. Then the weed seedlings are turned into soil by ploughing before sowing.

Defoliators/soil borne pathogens
Cultural control: • deep ploughing to expose the soil borne pathogens and hibernating stage of defoliators. • prepare the level and well drained field to reduce the incidence of sclerotinia rot. • destruction of plant debris • for club rot management, soil amendment with lime (@ 1 kg/m2) to raise soil ph to 7.2 or apply neem cake @ 0.5 kg/m2 

Sowing/seedling*

Nutrients
• basal application of npk is done on soil test basis. Generally, 32 kg n, 16 kg p and 16 kg k per acre is required by mustard crop. • half of the n dose should be applied at the time of sowing. • basal application of 16 kg sulphur /acre is also recommended for mustard. • under alkaline conditions, s should be applied through gypsum

Weeds
Cultural control: • adopt crop rotation, if there is infestation of orobanche in previous season, pulse crop should be sown in place of mustard in that field. • early sowing in line with weed free certified seeds. • adopt recommended agronomic practices with respect to row spacing, plant spacing, fertilizers application, water management etc. To obtain the healthy plant stand. • adopt intercropping with wheat/pulses/ sugarcane. Chemical control: • apply oxadiargyl 6% ec @ 600 ml in 200 l of water/acre 0-3 days after sowing. As pre-emergence herbicide followed by one hand weeding at 30 days after planting, if required

Aphids
Cultural control: • early sowing to avoid damage due to mustard-aphid, and major diseases. • use tolerant varieties. • early planting to escape the damage. • use yellow sticky traps. Mechanical control: • destroy the affected part along with aphid population in the initial stage. Biological control: • 2 per cent neem oil and 5 per cent neem seed kernel extract (nske) effective against the mustard aphid • ladybird beetles viz., coccinella septempunctata, menochilus sexmaculata, hippodamia variegata and cheilomones vicina are most eff cient pradators of the mustard aphid. Adult beetle may feed an average of 10 to 15 adults/ day. • several species of syrphid /hover fly ie., sphaerophoria sp., eristallis sp., metasyrphis sp., xanthogramma sp and syrphus spp. • the braconid parasitoid, diaeretiella rapae. • the lacewing, chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi. • predatory bird motacilla cospica. • a number of entomogenous fungi, cephalosporium spp., entomophthora and verticillium lecanii infect aphids

Painted bug
Cultural control: • deep ploughing the soil to destroy eggs of painted bug. • early sowing is needed to avoid pest attack. • irrigate the crop in iv week after sowing to reduce pest attack. • quick threshing of the harvested crop should be done. Mechanical control: • burn the remains of mustard crop so that the stages of insect do not reach the next year crop. • the bugs usually congregate on the leaves and stem which can be jerked to dislodge them and killed in kerosene water biological control: • conserve bio-control agents such as alophora spp. (tachinid fl y) parasitizing eggs of painted bugs. Chemical control: • dichlorvos76% ec @ 250.8 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre • imidacloprid 70% ws @ 700 g/100 kg seed • phorate 10% cg @ 6000 g/acre
