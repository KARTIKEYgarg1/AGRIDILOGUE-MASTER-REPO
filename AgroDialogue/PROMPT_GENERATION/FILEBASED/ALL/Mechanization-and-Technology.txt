Mechanization and technology

What to do?

Procure appropriate machinery/ equipment as per land holding size and crop
Machinery &amp; equipment can be used by custom hiring/sharing by groups of farmers.
Conserve resources - use zero-till seed drill, laser leveler, happy seed drill rotavator, etc.
Training is provided on proper use of farm machinery and its routine maintenance and servicing through farm machinery training &amp;testing institutes (fmttis), kvks &amp; state
