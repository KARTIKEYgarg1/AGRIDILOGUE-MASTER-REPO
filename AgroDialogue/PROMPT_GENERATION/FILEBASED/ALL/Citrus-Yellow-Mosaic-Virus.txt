Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Organic control is not possible for this issue.
Chemical Control
Chemical control for the vector is not enough for controlling the virus. Always ensure virus-free budwood.

What caused it?
Citrus yellow mosaic virus (CYMV) was first found in India and is now common in Andhra Pradesh, India, where citrus is grown on a large scale. This disease can spread through contaminated budwood and many commercial nurseries have reported cases of this disease. The virus can also be transmitted by the citrus mealybug and through contamincated tools. The virus can spread from one tree to the other with dodder, which is a common weed.

Preventive Measures 
Use only virus-free, certified budwood for propagation.
Citrus mealybug (Planococcus citri) has been identified as the virus vector, so control of this pest is also helpful.
Clean the field from weeds and especially dodder.
Always clean your tools between uses in different trees.
Breeding for resistance is not yet available and there is still need to develop a sensitive diagnostic tool for early detection.
