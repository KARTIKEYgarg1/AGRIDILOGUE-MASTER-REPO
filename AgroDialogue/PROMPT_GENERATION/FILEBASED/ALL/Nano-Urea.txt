Nano urea

Nano urea is an innovative nano fertilizer developed indigenously.

What is nano urea
Nano urea is a nanotechnology based revolutionary agri-input which provides nitrogen to plants. When compared to conventional urea prill, it has a desirable particle size of about 20-50 nm and more surface area (10,000 times over 1 mm urea prill) and number of particles (55,000 nitrogen particles over 1 mm urea prill).

Benefits
Nano urea is produced by an energy efficient environment friendly production process with less carbon footprints.
Increased availability to crop by more than 80% resulting in higher nutrient use efficiency.
Its application to crops as foliar fertilization enhances crop productivity to the tune of 8% with commensurate benefits in terms of better soil, air and water, and farmers profitability.

How to use it
Iffco nano urea (liquid) is world’s first nanofertilizers which has been notified by fertilizer control order (fco, 1985), government of india. Nano urea contains 4.0 % total nitrogen (w/v).

Time & method of application
Mix 2-4 ml of nano urea (4 % n) in one litre of water and spray on crop leaves at its active growth stages.
For best results apply 2 foliar sprays
1st spray: at active tillering/branching stage (30-35 days after germination or 20-25 days after transplanting)
2nd spray: 20-25 days after 1st spray or before flowering in the crop.

Use flat fan or cut nozzles for uniform spraying on the foliage.​​
Spray during morning or evening hours avoiding dew.​
It is advised to repeat the spray, if rain occurs within 12 hours of nano urea spray.​
Nano urea (liquid) is recommended for application only as a foliar spray at critical growth stages of crops.

Note – don’t cut off basal nitrogen supplied through dap or complex fertilizers. Cut only top-dressed urea which is being applied in 2-3 splits. Number of sprays of nano urea can be increased or decreased depending upon crop, its duration and overall nitrogen requirement.

Price of nano urea (liquid) is rs 240 / 500 ml bottle. Nano urea (liquid) is available at iffco member cooperatives (pacs), farmer service centers: iffco bazar centers and retail outlets. Now farmers can also order it online from .
