What caused it?
The symptoms are caused by the Apple Mosaic Virus, which has a wide host range, including woody and herbaceous plants. The virus has no natural vector. Infected branches transmit the virus when used as slips for grafting. The virus can also be transmitted through the roots. Symptoms are more pronounced in years with moderate springtime temperatures.

Preventive Measures 
Use certified virus-free material.
Do not use slips from infected trees for grafting.
Use thermotherapy for 24 to 32 days at 38Â°C to limit the outbreak of the virus.
Remove infected plant parts and weeds on your field.
