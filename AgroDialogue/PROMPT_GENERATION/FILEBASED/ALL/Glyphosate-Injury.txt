Glyphosate Injury

Symptoms
The earliest symptoms show white/yellow discolouration at the base of young leaflets. Leaflets appear small and crinkled with brown edges and are cupped upwards. Fewer flowers are produced resulting in yield loss. Fruits become deformed and are smaller with dark brown scarring. In severe cases, necrosis typically begins at the top of the plant and moves downwards.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by the inappropriate use of the non-selective herbicide of glyphosate. This results in spray drift either from an application of the farmer, a neighbour or from glyphosate residue in a multi-use pesticide sprayer and can affect non-target plant species. The herbicide is applied through foliar application and translocated throughout the plant. It kills the plants by interfering with a plant chemical that is necessary for the production of amino acids required for new growth. Transmission can also occur through off-target contamination such as drift, sprayer contamination, carry-over in the soil, volatile, accidental applications etc. The extent of the damage depends on factors such as the amount of exposure, growing conditions, cultivar affected and the stage of growth. The damage can be extensive and often results in the permanent loss of valuable plants.

Preventive Measures 
Water and fertilize plants to promote good health.
Read and follow label instructions on all chemicals, in addition to the use of recommended fertilizers at appropriate rates.
Calibrate sprayer and be cautious when applying the herbicide around plants.
Avoid spraying during cool, wet weather as the herbicide metabolizes slower during this period.
Apply herbicides when wind speed is low and its direction is such that drift is minimum.
Avoid using herbicide spray equipment to apply insecticides or fungicides.
Usually, it is too late to reverse the injury once the symptoms appear.
However, if the symptoms are not severe and the plant does not die, new growth may be normal.
