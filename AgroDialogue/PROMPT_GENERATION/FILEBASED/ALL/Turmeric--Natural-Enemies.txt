Natural enemies
Attractant/repellent/trap plants

Shoot borer:

• parasitoids: bracon sp (larval), myosoma sp (larval), apanteles sp (larval) , xanthopimpla sp (larval and pupal) etc., • predators: chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi, coccinellids, king crow, wasp, dragonfly, spiders, robber fly, reduviid bug, praying mantids, fire ants entomopathogenic nematode (epn) of the genus rhabditis/ oscheius and hexamermis sp.
• attractant plants for natural enemies: carrot family, sunflower family, buckwheat, alfalfa, corn, shrubs (minute pirate bug, lacewing and ladybird beetle). • nectar rich plants with small flowers i.e. Anise, caraway, dill, parsley, mustard, sunflower, buckwheat and cowpea (braconid wasp) • maintaining hedgerows around the turmeric plantation also helps to maintain a population of ladybird beetle, spiders, etc. • mulching with green leaves @ 4–4.5 t/acre at the time of planting. It is repeated @ 2 t/acre at 40 and 90 days after planting. • use of lantana camara and vitex negundo as mulch at the time of planting may reduce the infection of shoot borer. • epn, rhabditis/oscheius as biopesticides for management of the shoot borer and other insect pests of turmeric.

Leaf roller:

• parasitoids: apanteles sp, sympiesis sp, brachymeria oxodentata • parasite: ceromyia sp.
• attractant plants for natural enemies: carrot family, sunflower family, buckwheat, cowpea, alfalfa, corn, shrubs (apanteles sp, sympiesis sp, brachymeria oxodentata &amp; ceromyia sp). • nectar rich plants with small flowers i.e. Anise, caraway, dill, parsley, mustard, sunflower, buckwheat and cowpea (apanteles sp, sympiesis sp, brachymeria oxodentata)

Rhizome / soft rot:

• incorporation of neem cake and pine needle in the soil. • different types of cropping systems cropping like maize, chili, brinjal, papaya, cucumber, pumpkin, yam, tree tomato, tapioca and different types of leguminous crops. • application of oil cakes made from azadirachta indica, calophyllum inophyllum, pongamia glabra, hibiscus sabdariffa and brassica campestris • intercrop turmeric with maize and pineapple.

Root-knot nematode:

• intercropping with marigold @ 5:1 • repellant plants for nematodes: marigold, gliricidia, asparagus, dahelia etc. • crop rotation: marigold, chrysanthemum, sesbania, crotalaria spp., gaillardia, cluster bean and desmodium spp., • border crops: strips of ryegrass, cover crops and mulch beds (rove beetle) • soil incorporation of gliricidia compost, neem seed cake.
