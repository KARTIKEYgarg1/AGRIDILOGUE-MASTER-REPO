Npm comes handy to a deserted woman
Ms macchala ravanamma, a woman farmer resides in ambedkar nagar village of dakkali mandal in nellore district. Her husband deserted her and she lost her only daughter too. She had to look after her old mother, besides battling health problems. To meet her daily provisions she was forced to labour.

There is a forest near her village which contained lot of barren land. Unfortunately it was not permitted for use. She was dreaming of cultivating vegetables for her sustainability, but there was no other source. It was during this time that the district officials of the non pesticides management movement visited her village and said that they will provide the land for lease to identified families for cultivation. Immediately her hidden desire sprang up and she stated that if i am selected as a beneficiary i will enroll myself into npm method. Accordingly, in june 2009 she was given half acre of land. She was trained by the officials to cultivate paddy in 0.25 acre using the system of rice intensification (sri) method. In the remaining 0.25 acre she cultivated vegetables.
