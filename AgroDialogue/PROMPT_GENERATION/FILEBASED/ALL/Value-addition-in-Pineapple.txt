Pineapple in meghalaya

Pineapple (ananas comosus) is non-climacteric fruit grown widely in meghalaya. It is rich in vitamin c, magnesium calcium, potassium, iron and the protein digesting enzyme, bromelin. Kew and queen are the two promising cultivars of pineapple in north east india. Kew variety is characterized by the big sized fruits (1.5-2.5 kg) which are oblong and tapering slightly towards the crown. The flesh is light yellow and very juicy when ripe. Queen variety fruits are of the weight 0.9-1.3 kg in general. The flesh is deep golden-yellow less juicy than kew, crisp textured with a pleasant aroma and flavour. Pineapple plants flower 10-12 months after planting and fruits become ready 16-18 months after planting. In natural condition it is harvested during may-august. Fruits which mature in the winter are acidic. The fruits with crown can be kept for 10-15 days after harvesting.
