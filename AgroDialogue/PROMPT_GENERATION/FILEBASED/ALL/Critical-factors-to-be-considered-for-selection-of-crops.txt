Critical factors to be considered for selection of crops

Agricultural universities, research institutes, krishi vigyan kendras have been generating ample technologies to improve the productivity and profitability of the farmers. However, knowledge gap is prevailing among farmers and those who have access to knowledge harvest better profits.

Key requirements for improving productivity

Increase in productivity and profitability can be achieved through:

Blending practical knowledge with scientific technologies 
Efficient use of natural resources
Adopting time specific management practices 
Giving priority for quality driven production
Adopting suitable farming systems
Adoption of location specific technology
Market demand driven production
Adopting low cost and no cost technologies

Factors influencing decisions on the selection of crops & cropping system

Farmers need to answer all the below questions while making decisions for choosing a crop/ cropping pattern. During this decision making process, farmers cross check the suitability of proposed crop/cropping systems with their existing resources and other conditions. Thereby, they justify choosing or rejecting a crop/cropping systems. This process enables the farmers to undertake a swot analysis internally which in turn guides them to take an appropriate decision.

Climatic factors - is the crop/cropping system suitable for local weather parameters such as temperature, rainfall, sun shine hours, relative humidity, wind velocity, wind direction, seasons and agro-ecological situations?
