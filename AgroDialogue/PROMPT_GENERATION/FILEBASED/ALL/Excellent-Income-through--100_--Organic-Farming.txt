Excellent income through 100% organic farming
The ngo named jattu is situated at thotapalli village of vizianagaram district. They have developed 2 acres of land into a prakruthi adi devobhava – a training centre for sustainable agriculture. Seven types of crop model has been showcased in the centre for educating the farmers. the crop models developed at the centre include :
A rectangle shaped 10 gunta (0.25 acre) vegetable cultivation model.
A round shaped 10 gunta vegetable cultivation model.
System of rice intensification (sri) in 10 gunta.
10 gunta of shady crop model.
10 gunta of banana with inter cropiing (plantain) model. 
Bhaskara saave crop model 
Dry land crop model for tribal regions.

The above mentioned models were entrusted to a farmer named mr. K.gangaraju, a native of bandaluppi village of parvathipuram mandal who belongs to the kurakula community. He owns 30 cents of land. His ancestors practised organic farming in this land. As years passed, his needs increased and in search of easy method to earn more, he started using chemicals. Although he was satisfied with good income, expenditure increased and consequently he landed up in debt. He said to himself that agriculture is not profitable at all and planned to migrate to hyderabad for better earnings.

It was at this point, that he learned from the cluster activist of addapuseela village about the job opportunity at prakruthi adi devobhava campus and joined as an employee. He was insisted by the ngo to adopt npm methods for the cultivation of crops in the centre. He was of the strong opinion that it was not possible to get good yields with npm method.

After completion of one year, his attitude changed totally. He was habituated to npm manures like nadep compost, farm yard manure, neem cake, dravajeevamrutham, ganajeevamrutham, etc.

Note
Expenses towards seeds, jaggery, bengalgram flour and ploughing are the actual expenses.
Since tank silt was freely applied under mnrega programme, cost of rs 3000 was shown as expenditure.
Ganajivamrutham preparation costs rs 1,400
It is hence possible and was proved that rs 60,000 could be generated by a family from a 0.5 acre of irrigated land.
