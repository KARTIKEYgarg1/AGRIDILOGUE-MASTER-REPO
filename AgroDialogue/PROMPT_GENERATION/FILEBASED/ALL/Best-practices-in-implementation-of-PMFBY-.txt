Best practices in implementation of pmfby 

Introduction
Pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana (pmfby) is a crop insurance scheme which envisages an efficient insurance support for farmers of the country. Pmfby aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture sector by:
Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/ damage arising out of unforeseen events
Stabilising the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming
Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices
Ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector the priority programme contributes to food security, crop diversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector, besides protecting farmers from production risks.

The focus areas with regards to implementation of pmfby are as follows:
Spreading awareness through publicity campaigns
Educating farmers about the benefits of the scheme to persuade them to get coverage under pmfby
Wide coverage of non-loanee farmers under the scheme
Coverage of maximum cropped area under the scheme
Timely upload of information for insured farmers on crop insurance portal by financial institutions
Electronic submission of submitting crop cutting experiment (cce) results
Ensuring timely settlement of claims
Ensuring transparency/accountability in the implementation of the scheme

Because every one loves a good crop
In a country where farmers toil to feed a population of 1.3 billion, the pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana is indeed a farmer-friendly scheme, eliminating complexities to meaningfully address crop losses faced by farmers. In baghpat district of uttar pradesh, village level workers organise regular discussions at short intervals to motivate and create awareness for adopting the scheme.

Many training programmes and farmer fests have been organised in the area to educate farmers on various aspects of the scheme including the need for crop insurance, climatic conditions of the district, procedure of enrolment, nearby facilitation centres, etc.

District level officials of department of agriculture, insurance company representatives and other officials of cooperative departments participate in village campaigns which enhance their impact and assure farmers about the insurance company activities.

In some villages, farmers who already benefited in such schemes also share their experiences. This boosts the confidence of other farmers to continue farming despite natural calamities like drought and flood. They are also motivated to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices.

Owing to the success of the promotions, for the kharif crops season, over 12,000 farmers were covered and for the rabi crops season nearly 3,000 farmers were covered.

Best practices for replication

Awareness:
Most important factor to ensure effective implementation of pmfby is awareness. Concerted efforts should be undertaken to create awareness amongst the farmers with the aim to increase the number of non-loanee farmers enrolled and to increase the coverage of total cropped area.
Kisan melas, farmer goshthis and fortnight campaigns may be organised by the district administration to publicise pmfby.
Farmers should be made aware of the cut-off dates of kharif and rabi insurance timelines under the scheme by distribution of calendars, regular village meetings, helpdesks at village centres and cscs, etc.
Mobile vans and all types of media, social, electronic and print may be leveraged to create awareness.

Implementation:
Capacity building of the officials is important to upload crop cutting experiment (cce) data and farmer’s information on the crop insurance portal (cip). Cce data and beneficiary information should be regularly uploaded on the cce app and cip, respectively.
Village level entrepreneurs (vle) in common service centres (cscs), aaple sarkar seva kendras (maharashtra) etc. Are important agents who provide assistance to farmers in the process of filling and submitting applications.
Banks should open more counters and help desks to support and help farmers in completing documentation before the cut-off date. In beed, strategic police deployment was done to avoid law and order issues due to rush towards the cut-off date.
Zero balance accounts can be opened in cooperative banks to bring non-loanee and loanee farmers in the cooperative fold for speedy premium collection and claim amount distribution.
Additionally, primary agriculture credit societies (pacs) are involved as they have grassroot connectivity and are working as agencies for insurance companies.
Policy interventions by districts to accommodate the needs and requirements of farmers such as keeping banks open on holidays and sundays close to the cut-off date.
District level monitoring committee (dlmc) has been actively monitoring in many districts and they meet at regular intervals to discuss the progress of the scheme implementation.
In sivaganga, crop signatures from remote sensing based information and insurance for crops in emerging economies (riice)-satellite technology was used to avail the total claim of the enrolled farmers previously denied by the insurance company.
Implementation of the scheme also saw aadhaar authentication, linkage to jan dhan account and transfer of claim directly to beneficiary’s account by direct benefit transfer (dbt).
Transparency should be made by steps like presence of both village level workers (vlw) and insurance company representative in west tripura during processing of application and assessment of crop damage.
Grievance redressal mechanism should be in place. Redressal of complaints may be done directly via whatsapp groups, call centres, toll free call numbers and weekly/ monthly meetings with all the stakeholders.

A trump card for india’s agrarian society
One of the reasons for rising farm distress in india is crop failures and yield losses triggered by vagaries of climate. Moreover, dwindling rainfall fill the farmers’ lives with uncertainty. Nagapattinam district of has traditionally been called the paddy granary of south india, where most precipitation occurs within a very short span of 45 days. However, the actual rainfall received was only 1714.03 mm in 2017.

To mitigate the effects of farm issues like these, the benefits of pmfby were publicised in the district which is aimed at shielding farmers from uncertainty through insurance. The scheme was heavily promoted to motivate farmers and create awareness amongst them to enrol in the programme. The authorities enlightened farmers with various aspects of pmfby - from the need for crop insurance, procedure of enrolment, nearby facilitation centres, enrolment centre for the village and compensation amount details, amongst other things. Additionally, radio talks and cultural programmes were conducted at village level to enrol more farmers. As a result, nearly a million of farmers enrolled under pmfby during rabi season 2016-17 and 2017-18.

Suggestions for effective implementation
Pmfby has multiple challenges due to diversity of cropped area, different terrains, coordination among stakeholders viz. Banks, insurance companies. This section contains suggestions, to overcome some challenges, made by various districts who applied for pm awards.
Motivating farmers to adopt pmfby for risk coverage required behavioural change. Generally, when the crop doesn’t fail, farmers feel cheated as there is no return and in such scenarios coverage gets reduced in the following year. In efforts to overcome this challenge premium could be reduced for farmers when there is no claim in a year. This could be on pattern of no claim benefit as in case of car insurance. Another suggestion was that centre and state may bear full cost and premium be recovered from farmer in case of failure.
Cash incentive could be given to best performing field functionaries which will motivate them to conduct awareness campaigns and convince farmers of the scheme benefits.
The other challenge is the non-inclusion of some horticulture crops in the scheme and the high premium amount for horticulture crops (5%) compared to other crops (2%). For this farmers’ premium for horticulture crops should be reduced and made at par with agriculture crops.
There is requirement of proper capacity building and training as states and districts should be made aware about provision such as of extending of cut-off dates that can be adopted by the state depending on the kharif and rabi crop cycle of that particular state/district.
Technologies like satellite imagery can be used for assessing crop damage. In addition, geotagging of the crop cutting experiment could be linked with digitization of land records to shorten the process of testifying land records at the level of circle officer/tehsildar.
The scheme’s scope is limited for districts in north-east where they have unique problems such as destruction of farm by wild animals, greater number of farmers producing horticulture crops, difficult terrain and low network connectivity. Special policy interventions should be taken to increase coverage.
There should be a robust grievance redressal mechanism provided by insurance companies in addition to the one provided by common service centres (cscs) / officials.
In the current system documents such as 7-12 extract, sowing certificates, bank passbook photocopy, aadhaar card copy etc. Are required for filling of the application. In order to save time of farmers record of rights (ror) should be linked with aadhaar.

Together through the unpredictable
The cuckoo’s call chimed through the sky as a farmer looked up at the rising sun and the paddy field he was working upon was suddenly doused with golden sunrays. In ramanathapuram district in tamil nadu, climate and other geographical factors like lack of major rivers, rainfall, etc. Routinely affects the agricultural produce. Apart from this, natural disasters are a commonplace, with floods and droughts spontaneously tormenting the natives.

For the benefit of the farmers who harvest crops, the most important element for sustenance, the government has launched and successfully applied the pmfby scheme in the district.

Sitting in the village’s common area, villagers were explained in local language, the important features offered by pmfby, including crop insurance, climatic conditions, enrolment procedure, nearby facilitation centres, required documents, and amount of premium, compensation amount details and the schedules.

The farmers’ queries are also handled with understanding and patience, giving them further assurance. The successful campaigning has brought nearly 29,659 more farmers into the ambit of pmfby.
