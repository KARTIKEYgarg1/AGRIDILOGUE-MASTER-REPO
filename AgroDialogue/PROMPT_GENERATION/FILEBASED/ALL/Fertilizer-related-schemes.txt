Fertilizer related schemes

Two new measures have been launched as part of the fertiliser reform story of india.

Pradanmantri kisan samrudhi kendra (pmksk) 
The pradanmantri kisan samrudhi kendra (pmksk) will cater to the needs of the farmers in the country and provide agri-inputs (fertilizers, seeds, implements) including testing facilities for soil, seeds and fertilizers. These kendras will also help create awareness among the farmers. 

Under the scheme, the retail fertiliser shops in the country will be converted into pmksk in a phased manner. Pmksk will cater to a wide variety of needs of the farmers and provide agri-inputs (fertilisers, seeds, implements), testing facilities for soil, seeds, and fertilisers; generate awareness among farmers; provide information regarding various government schemes and ensure regular capacity building of retailers at block/district level outlets. 

More than 3.25 lakh fertiliser shops across the country are to be started as pradhan mantri kisan samruddhi kendras. 

Pradhan mantri bhartiya jan urvarak pariyojana
Pradhan mantri bhartiya jan urvarak pariyojana or the one nation, one fertiliser is an initiative of the ministry of chemicals & fertilizers.

The scheme aims to implement one nation one fertilizer by introducing single brand for fertilizers and logo under fertilizer subsidy scheme namely "pradhanmantri bhartiya janurvarak pariyojna" (pmbjp). The single brand name for urea, dap, mop and npks etc. Would be bharat urea, bharat dap, bharat mop and bharat npk etc. Respectively for all fertilizer companies, state trading entities (stes) and fertilizer marketing entities (fmes). Through the initiative the farmer gets rid of all kinds of confusion about the quality of the fertiliser and its availability. To begin with, bharat urea bags, which will help companies market fertilisers under the single brand name ‘bharat’ has been launched. Now the urea sold in the country will be of the same name, same brand and same quality and this brand is bharat.

Bharat brand
A logo indicating fertilizer subsidy scheme namely pradhanmantri bhartiya janurvarak pariyojna will be used on said fertilizer bags. The print will be done on one side of fertilizer's bag. Two-third of the fertilizer's bag will be used for new brand name and logo with pradhanmantri bhartiya janurvarak pariyojna and one-third will be used for using fertilizer companies' name, logo and other information as required in different rules & regulations etc.

Fertilizer companies are advised not to procure old designed bags w.e.f 15.09.2022. The new bags under one nation one fertilizer concept will be introduced w.e.f 02.10.2022. A lead time of four months i.e upto 31.12.2022 has been given to exhaust old designed bags from the market.
