Herbicide Burn

Symptoms
Symptoms depend on the herbicide used, application time and the dosage. Generally, leaves exhibit water-soaked lesions, which later dry up. Burning of tissue or failed emergence are characteristic of these herbicides when applied pre-emergence. When applied post-emergence, they can cause burning in a speckled pattern. It can be confused with paraquat injury but has, in turn, no bronze coloration.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
There is no biological treatment available for this condition. Prevention and good farming practices are the keys to avoiding the harm that happens in the first place. Wash and rinse plants thoroughly in the case of suspected overdosage.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments, if available. Before planning a herbicide spray, be sure that you know the type of weed you are dealing with (basically broadleaf weeds vs grasses) and choose the best method available. Carefully select the herbicide and follow dosage instructions as indicated on the label.

What caused it?
The damage is caused by herbicides of the PPO inhibitors, among other Flumioxazin, Fomesafen, Lactofen, Carfentrazone, Acifluorfen, belonging to the diphenyl ether family. They disrupt the cell membrane among other things by blocking the production of chlorophyll. Leaf symptoms appear within 1-3 days, depending on light and weather conditions. The symptoms are triggered by light and worsen on bright, warm days.

Preventive Measures 
Be sure to know the type of weed you are dealing with (basically broadleaf weeds or grasses).
Carefully select the herbicide that best fits your purpose.
Read the label carefully and follow dosage instructions as indicated.
Always clean the spray container after use to avoid contamination with a different herbicide.
Avoid spraying in windy conditions to prevent drift to other fields.
Use drift reducing spray nozzles that target weeds better.
Try and test the herbicide in pastures and hayfields to monitor results.
Check weather forecast carefully and do not spray in case of sunny and warm conditions.
Keep a log of activities with application dates, products, field locations and weather conditions.
