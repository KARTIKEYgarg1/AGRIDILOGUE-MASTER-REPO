Specific attention and provisions for vulnerable groups

Disabled persons

The disabled or differently-abled persons defined under the persons with disabilities (equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) act, 1995 (1 of 1996) as persons with disabilities, the severity of which is 40 per cent and above would be considered as special category of vulnerable persons for the purposes of mgnrega. The disabled persons as defined in the national trust for welfare of persons with autism cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities act, 1999 (44 of 1999) are also to be considered as disabled for the purpose of inclusion in mgnrega.

The following are the exclusive measures for the promotion of the participation of the disabled persons:

Identification of suitable works
Mobilisation of disabled persons by focussing on awareness and special provisions
Specifically identified works for disabled persons in the case of large gps. Suggestive works include - appoint as mates and as workers for providing drinking water, sprinkling water on newly built wall, farm bunding, looking after children, plantation, etc
Adoption of tools and equipment/facilities at work places
Treating persons with disabilities with respect
Special drive to ensure 100 days of employment to such households
Provide special job card of a distinct colour

Vulnerable tribal groups (pvtgs)

Primitive tribal groups live in forest and hills and are highly vulnerable to hunger/starvation, malnutrition and ill-health. Appropriate programme flexibility should be adopted by the state governments to reach the benefit of mgnregs to them.

De-notified tribes

A dpc may estimate the number of nomadic tribes in the district and authorise the pos to issue special job cards, which will be honoured in any gram panchayat in the district. The nomadic tribes can take up work in any gram panchayat. Bank accounts should be opened for the nomadic tribes in a bank with core banking facility and an atm/debit card.

Women in special circumstances category

Widowed, deserted and destitute women are highly vulnerable and require special attention. Gp should initiate special measures to ensure 100 days employment for them. Special works which require less physical effort and are close to their house should be identified and implemented for them. As per para 1, schedule ii, if the job seeker is a single woman or disabled or aged person or released bonded labour or belonging to particularly vulnerable tribal group, she must be given a special job card of a distinct colour which will ensure them a special protection in providing work, work evaluation and worksite facilitates.

Senior citizens

Exclusive senior citizen groups may be formed and special works which require lesser physical effort identified and allotted to these groups.

Internally displaced persons

The dpc concerned may issue a special job card indicating that they are internally displaced persons. This job card will be valid till these families are displaced and will lose its validity as soon as they return to their original place of residence.
