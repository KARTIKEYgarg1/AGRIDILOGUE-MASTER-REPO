Shgs of ganjam blossoming along with their gerbera plantation initiative

Women farmers of shgs in ganjam district are paving ways for other women towards economic upliftment by undertaking sustainable agro-ecological practices in floriculture, which is a thriving sector in the state.

Ganjam district in odisha is well known for its fertile soil and agricultural productivity. Agriculture is a traditional occupation and the way of living for a majority of inhabitants in the district. The district has 2 distinct geographical divisions-coastal plain area in the east and hills and table lands in the west. The district lends a passage to an exotic panorama of spellbinding flax-gold beaches, lustering waves and lush green forests.

Odisha livelihoods mission (olm) is making its best efforts in helping the rural masses meet their household needs through sustainable agricultural practices. This is done by encouraging women’s participation in forming strong base of community institutions. It is also helping the women groups to find new avenues for economic engagement; floriculture being one among them.

In nuapalli village of chattrapur block, the members of two prominent shgs – maa balakumari shg & maa bhairabi shg – have undertaken gerbera (flower) plantation as a livelihood. The project was conceived in the year 2018. All 20 members of both shgs are engaged in plantation, plucking and selling process. With the help of olm, the shgs have successfully raised rs 4,00,000/- (rupees four lakhs) from community investment fund (cif) from gram panchayat level federation (gplf) of bhikaripalli gp. Currently, the estimated total project cost is rs.4,77,960/- (rupees four lakh seventy-seven thousand nine hundred sixty only).

The flower bed is spread over 500 square meters of land inside a polyhouse. The shgs receive assistance from the horticulture department in the form of technical support, capacity building and subsidies. Most of the produce are bought by local florists and business persons. In other times, the shgs take orders directly from customers for cut flowers and bouquets. On an average, the net profit over the sale is around rs 1,50,000/- (one lakh fifty thousand) every year.

One of the impacts this intervention has created is the change in perception. What earlier was considered a trivial leisurely pursuit, is now being considered as a profitable business prospect. Many shgs have come forward to initiate agricultural practices on the same lines. Through such initiatives, the women are becoming more involved in improving their household economics.

The socio-economic conditions of the women and their families have begun to change. Societies at large are being elevated from impoverishment and women are immensely contributing towards economic upliftment of rural odisha.
