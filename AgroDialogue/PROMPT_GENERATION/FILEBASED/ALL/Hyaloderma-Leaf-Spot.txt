Hyaloderma Leaf Spot

Symptoms
Fungus growth occurs on the lower side of the leaves. Spotting leads to defoliation. Lesions spread to healthy leaves and coalesce to form large irregular to semi-circular lesion areas on the surface of the leaves up to 4 - 5 mm in diameter.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Up to this day, no biological control method is known.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with available biological treatments. Copper oxychloride (0 - 3%) spray during the rainy season can manage the disease.

What caused it?
The damage is caused by the fungus, which infects mature leaves in wet weather. In more advanced stages and under humid conditions the disease can cause severe spots on the leaves around the middle lamina.

Preventive Measures 
Applications of copper formulations just before the long periods of disease-favorable conditions can provide protection.
