State-specific strategies for doubling farmers' income

Doubling of farmers’ income by 2022 is the most important agenda of government of india. With this in view, icar has intensified efforts towards farmers’ participatory research to develop and scale up location specific, cost effective and climate resilient technologies to enhance agricultural production, productivity and profitability in the agriculture sector and increase farmers’ income.

To realise this, indian council of agricultural research constituted state level coordination committees (slccs) headed by a senior vice chancellor of anagricultural university in each state to arrive at state-specific strategies document. 

Scope of the document

The document provides strategies for all the agro-ecologies of the states keeping in mind the scope and potential for development of horticulture, livestock, fisheries, agro-forestry and post-harvest processing in the states. The documents focus on enhanced production, reduction of cost, improvement in quality besides providing strategy for scaling out these technologies.

The summary of the detailed state specific documents includes in brief the approaches, major strategies and technology interventions included to be implemented in different states at times supported by few case studies/ success stories. The strategies in the document focus on increased emphasis on agri-business through transforming farming into agri-enterprises performing multiple functions at one point of time. Encouraging processing and building value chains would help create non-farm jobs in rural areas. We sincerely hope that the document will be found useful by various development agencies and departments besides policy planners, farmers, field extension workers and concerned scientists alike, and will play a meaningful role towards realising doubling farmers' income.
