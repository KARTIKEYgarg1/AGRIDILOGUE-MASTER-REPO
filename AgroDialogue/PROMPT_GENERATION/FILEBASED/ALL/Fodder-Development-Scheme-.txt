Fodder development scheme 

The department animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries is implementing a central sector scheme, ‘central fodder development organization’ and a ‘centrally sponsored fodder development scheme’ to supplement the efforts of states in feed and fodder development.

Components of the scheme

The centrally sponsored fodder development scheme is being implemented from 2005-06 with the following four components:

Establishment of fodder block making units
Grassland development including grass reserves
Fodder seed production and distribution.
Biotechnology research projects

The centrally sponsored fodder development scheme has been modified from 2010 to ensure efficient use of available fodder/feed. The modification has been done on the recommendations of the working group on animal husbandry, dairying & fisheries. the scheme incorporates the following components/technology interventions:

Strengthening of feed testing laboratories 
Introduction of chaff cutters
Establishment of silage making units 
Demonstration of azolla cultivation and production units
Establishment of by-pass protein production units
Establishment of area specific mineral mixture (asmm) / feed pelleting / feed manufacturing units

Further the amount of subsidy given under the ongoing component, establishment of fodder block making units has been increased to 50% to encourage better participation and the land requirement for assistance under the grassland development including grass reserves component has been revised to 5-10 hq.
