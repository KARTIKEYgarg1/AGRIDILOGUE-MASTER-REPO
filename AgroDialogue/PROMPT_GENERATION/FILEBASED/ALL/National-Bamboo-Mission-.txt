National bamboo mission 

Background 

Bamboo is a versatile group of plants which is capable of providing ecological, economic and livelihood security to the people. Till recently, it has remained confined to the forests (12.8% of forest cover); two third of the growing stock located in the north-eastern states. Importance of the crop as a source of raw material for industrial and domestic use with its growing demand all over the country necessitated its cultivation in farm lands as well.

With a view to harness the potential of bamboo crop, department of agriculture & cooperation (dac), ministry of agriculture & farmers welfare is implementing a 100% centrally sponsored scheme called mission for integrated development of horticulture (midh) in which national bamboo mission (nbm) is being implemented as a sub scheme.

The mission envisages promoting holistic growth of bamboo sector by adopting area-based, regionally differentiated strategy and to increase the area under bamboo cultivation and marketing. Under the mission, steps have been taken to increase the availability of quality planting material by supporting the setting up of new nurseries and strengthening of existing ones. To address forward integration, the mission is taking steps to strengthen marketing of bamboo products, especially those of handicraft items.

Objectives

To promote the growth of the bamboo sector through as an area based regionally differentiated strategy;
To increase the coverage of area under bamboo in potential areas, with improved varieties to enhance yields;
To promote marketing of bamboo and bamboo based handicrafts;
To establish convergence and synergy among stake-holders for the development of bamboo;
To promote, develop and disseminate technologies through a seamless blend of traditional wisdom and modern scientific knowledge.
To generate employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled persons, especially unemployed youths.

States/ districts covered

The mission will focus on development of bamboo in limited states where it has social, commercial and economical advantage, particularly in the north eastern region and states including madhya pradesh, maharashtra, chhattisgarh, odisha, karnataka, uttarakhand, bihar, jharkhand, andhra pradesh, telangana, gujarat, tamil nadu and kerala.

The mission is expected to establish about 4000 treatment/ product development units and bring more than 100000 ha area under plantation during the period 2018-19 & 2019-20.

Strategy

To achieve the above objectives, the mission would adopt the following strategies:

 adopt a coordinated approach covering production and marketing to assure appropriate returns to growers/producers.
 promote research and development (r&amp;d) of varieties and technologies for enhanced production.
 enhance acreage (in forest and non-forest areas) and productivity of bamboo through varietal change and improved agriculture practice.
 promote partnership, convergence and synergy among r&amp;d and marketing agencies in public as well as private sectors, at all levels.
 promote where appropriate, cooperatives and self-help groups to ensure support and adequate returns to farmers.
 to generate employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled persons, especially unemployed youths. 
 set up national, state and sub-state level structures, to ensure adequate returns for the produce of the farmers and eliminate middlemen, to the extent possible.
