Pepper Spot and Scorch

Symptoms
The pepper spot phase is characterized by minute necrotic spots on the lower leaves close to the soil surface. The spots are numerous and pinhole-sized. Scorch occurs when a V-shaped part of the leaf dies (usually on the margin) and a yellow zone forms next to it.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Plant resistant varieties.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach along with preventive measures and available biological treatment. Apply fungicides that are used for controlling other foliage diseases, such as chlorothalonil. Use a protectant fungicide if no other disease influences the choice.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by the fungus of Leptosphaerulina arachidicola, which survives on peanut residues and is spread by wind. Pseudothecia form abundantly in necrotic leaf tissue. Peak dispersal periods of forcibly ejected ascospores occur at the end of the dew period and the onset of rainfall.

Preventive Measures 
Practice early sowing and crop rotation.
Reduce the rate of pathogen increase and spread.
