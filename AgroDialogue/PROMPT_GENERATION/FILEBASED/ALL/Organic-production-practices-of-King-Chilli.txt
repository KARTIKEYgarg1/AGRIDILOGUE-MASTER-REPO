Sowing of seeds - the seed can be sown in bed/ small poly bags/ disposable cups at 1-2 inch depth.
Time of sowing - seed can be sown in first week of january to second week of february. 
Nursery should be watered after every alternate day or when it is too dry. 
Damping off is the disease that comes at nursery stage but seed treatment with trichoderma virdi or trichoderma harzianum will prevent not only damping off but many other diseases also.

Symptoms of anthracnose in naga king chilli

Leaf curl of chilli (tobacco leaf curl virus)

Leaves become small in size, plants become stunted and poor with no bearing of fruits.

Uproot and burn infested plants. Early spray of neem oil @ 5ml/litre of water or spray dipole (a biopesticide) @ 1-4 teaspoon / 4 litres water to control white fly which is vector for transmission of viral disease. Growing resistant varieties also is useful for prevention.

Disease management

The seeds may be treated with trichoderma and psuedomonas sp. @ 10 g per kg of seed to prevent diseses.
Careful seed selection and adoption of phytosanitary measures will check the diseases of chilli. 
Early removal of affected plants will control the spread of the diseases. 
Varieties tolerant to diseases should be used wherever the disease is severe. 
Rouging and destruction of affected plants help in checking the mosaic virus. 
For effective disease control, 10 g of trichoderma or pseduomonas sp. Per litre of water should be used for spraying.

Insects

The aphids, spider mites and fruit borer are the major insects.

Insects management - spray of neem oil @ 5 ml/liter of water after fruit setting to avoid the larval stage of fruit borer and control the aphid population at economic threshold level.
