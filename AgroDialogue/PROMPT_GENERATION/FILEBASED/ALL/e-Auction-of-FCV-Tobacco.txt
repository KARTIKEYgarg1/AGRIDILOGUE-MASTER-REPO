Process

In tobacco, the bidding process is very fast and it takes only 4 to 5 seconds for sale of each bale (bale consists of max. Of 150kg tobacco). The tobacco buyers shall present on the auction floor and see the tobacco bale for its colour, texture, aroma, flavour, moisture, size, etc., and offer the price. The quality varies from bale to bale.

In electronic auction system for marketing of tobacco, all the buyers and starters are provided with electronic device called hand held terminals (hht). All the data about the bales offered for sale, their weight, lot number and its grade and any other remarks are available in all the hand held terminals. By use of hht, the starter starts a price to a particular lot/tobacco bale and the same appears on all the buyers hhts and those buyers who are interested on that particular lot will go on adding price in multiples of rs.1/- and the buyer who quotes highest will be allotted with the bale. The system provides complete transparency in bidding process and facilitates growers to view the bidding process through the electronic displays.
