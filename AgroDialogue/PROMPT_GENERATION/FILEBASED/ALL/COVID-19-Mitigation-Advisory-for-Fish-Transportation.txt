Covid-19 mitigation advisory for fish transportation

The world is facing an unprecedented threat from the covid-19 pandemic caused by the sars-cov-2 virus. The current evidence indicates that covid-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through respiratory droplets (formed on coughing or sneezing). The virus can spread directly from person-to-person when a covid-19 case coughs or sneezes, producing droplets that reach the nose, mouth, or eyes of another person.

Fish transportation services are essential services that keep the fish supply chain moving from aquaculture farms/fishing harbours to fish markets and processing plants; both within the state and between the states in the country. Their role in the crisis of covid-19 pandemic is very crucial for rapid and safe transport of highly perishable fish and fishery products across the length and breadth of the nation. During the course of fish delivery, the vehicle drivers may take the vehicles through covid zones and inadvertently get exposed to the novel coronavirus.

Icar-cift has brought out a covid-19 mitigation advisory for fish transportation which emphasizes the do’s and don’ts for personnel involved in the transportation of fish and government agencies/ district authorities and prevent the spread of corona virus and also to safeguard their own health.
