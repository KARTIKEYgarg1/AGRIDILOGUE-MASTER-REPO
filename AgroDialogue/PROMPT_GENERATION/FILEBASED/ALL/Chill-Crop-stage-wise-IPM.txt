Management

Activity

Nutrients

Add well rotten farm yard manure (fym) @ 25 t/acre or vermicompost @ 4 t/acre. Incorporate at the time of field preparation 1 week (vermicompost) or 2 to 3 weeks (fym) before transplanting

Weeds

At the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique to minimize the weeds menace in field 
Keep the nursery weed free by hand weeding

Soil borne fungus, nematodes, and resting stages of insects

Cultural control:

Deep summer ploughing of fields to control nematodes, helicoverpa, and spodoptera. 
Soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil borne pests 

Biological control:

Apply neem cake @ 100 kg/acre at the time of transplanting for reducing nematodes and borer damage. 

Chemical control:

In nematode severe area apply carbofuran 3% cg granules @ 26,640 g/acre

Damping off

Cultural control: 

Excessive watering and poorly drained areas of field should be avoided 
Use raised beds: more than 15 cm height is better for water drainage. 
Raise seedlings in pro-trays/plug trays. 

Chemical control: 

Seed treatment with captan 75 ws @ 25- 30 g/kg seed 
Soil drenching with captan 75% wp @ 1000 g in 400 l of water/acre or

Seed sowing/ transplanting stage

Nutrients

Before sowing, soil testing should be done to find out the soil fertility status. Nutrient should be provided as per soil test recommendations. Generally, for rainfed chilli: 60: 30: 50: kg n: p: kg/ha should be applied as basal dose. For irrigated chilli: 60: 60: 30 kg n: p: k/ha should be applied as a basal dose.
Based on soil test for micronutrient, the deficient micronutrient should be applied in soil at sowing / transplanting. In zn deficient areas, zinc sulphate @ 25 kg/acre should be applied at last ploughing.
Biofertilizers: for seed treatment with azotobacter and phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (psb) cultures @ 8-10 g/kg seed 
For seedling root dip treatment with azotobacter and phosphorous solubilizing bacteria (psb) cultures @ 250 g/acre seedlings

Weeds

Vegetative stage

Nutrients

In rainfed chilli, apply 25 kg n/acre as top dressing with rains.

Third top dressing of 20 kg n + 10 kg k/acre should be done at 75 days after planting. 
Micronutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of particular micronutrient.
