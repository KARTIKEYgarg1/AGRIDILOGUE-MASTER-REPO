 kiwi crop stage wise ipm

Management activity

Pre planting

Common cultural practices:

 deep summer ploughing to break hard pan and to facilitate rain water absorption &amp; deep root penetration.
Timely planting should be done.
 vineyard sanitation
Destroy the alternate host plants

Nutrients

 apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations.
Do not leave fym or compost exposed to sunlight as nutrients may be lost.
Nutrient should be applied on the basis of soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
 pits of 1m x 1m x 1m size are dug at a distance of 6 m x 4 m and left exposed to sunlight.
 the rows should be oriented in north â€“ south direction for maximum light distribution.
Pits are filled with a mixture of 30 cm top soil, 40 kg farmyard manure and 45 g dap .

Weeds

Summer ploughing should be done to expose and destroy weed seeds/ rhizomes.

Soil borne pathogens, resting stages of insects

Cultural control:

Deep summer ploughing of vineyard s to control resting stages of insect pests.

Planting stage

Common cultural practices:

Use healthy, certified and weed free seeds
 grow resistant/tolerant varieties.

Nutrients

 before transplanting, soil testing should be done to find out the soil fertility status. Nutrient should be provided as per soil test recommendations.
 planting is done in december january in pits already filled with farm yard manure and vines are trained on t bars
Add mycorrhiza culture @ 50 grams per pit or a basket of soil taken from old kiwi orchard to ensure mycorrhiza association with seedling roots.

Weeds

 use weed free seedlings for planting.
Remove weeds from the pits before planting. 
Green manuring and leguminous vegetables crops like bean, pea, red clover and white clover should be grown to manage the weeds between vine rows as well as to improve soil texture and fertility.

Vegetative stage

Common cultural practices:

 destroy crop debris
Provide irrigation at critical stages of the plant
Avoid water logging

Common mechanical practices:

 collection and destruction of eggs and early stage larvae
 handpick the older larvae during early stages
 the infested plant parts collect and destroyed

Common biological practices:

 conserve natural enemies through ecological engineering.
 augmentative release of natural enemies.

Nutrients

The amount of manure and fertilizer to be applied is influenced by the age or size of tree, soil types, fertility, cultural practices and anticipated fruit yield.

The fertilizer should be applied in 2 equal doses, half to two third in january-february and the rest after fruit set in april-may.

The nutrients should be applied in 20-30 cm deep and 30 cms wide trench along the drip line of the tree.

Weeds

Cultural control:

Kiwi vineyards basins be maintained weed free by hand tool weeding or mulching tree basin in april with plastic or straw mulch helps control weeds and conserves soil moisture.
Weeds between rows of vines are controlled by cultivating, mowing, tilling and planting cover crops or use black polyethylene mulch to prevent entry of light, to restrict germination of weed seeds and smothering of weeds.
Use slashing and moving between the rows to control the weeds.

Passion vine hopper

Cultural control:

Heavy winter pruning of egg laying sites.
Spray them with neem; it acts as a deterrent and anti-feeder. Biodegrades within two weeks when exposed to sunlight. Repeated application.
Companion plants such as geranium and petunia, marjorams, coriander, chamomile and yarrow.

Biological control

Egg parasitoids aphelinidae (hymenoptera), scolypopa australis. Predators:.spider, birds

Thrips

Cultural control:

Sprinkle water over the seedlings to check the multiplication of thrips

Biological control

Release or augment the biological control agents like larval parasitoids- thripobius semiluteus and predators like predatory mite, predatory thrips, hover fly, mirid bug etc.

Phytophthora root rot, collar rot and crown rot

Cultural control:

Control of the disease is reliant on good water management.
Kiwi should be planted in well-draining soils where water does not pool after rain or irrigation;
Vineyard should be allowed to dry out between irrigations

Brown headed leaf roller/ green headed leaf roller

Cultural control

Follow proper training and pruning in the vineyards.
Infested leaves should be removed and burned to destroy the eggs and caterpillars.

Biological control

Release or augment the biological control agents like predators: predatory mite, predatory wasp and larval parasitoids like trigonospila brevifacies, braconid wasp, dolichogenidea tasmanica, goniozus jacintae

Greedy scale

Cultural control

Use propagative material that is free of scales.
Adequate plant spacing is important because armored scales seldom spread from plant to plant unless the crowns of the plants are in contact.
As plants grow, pruning maintains spacing and allows maximum coverage when using insecticides.

Mechanical control

Scraping and scrubbing to remove scales from plants are effective mechanical control tactics.

Biological control

Release or augment the biological control agents like parasitoids aphytis wasps, encarsia sp. And predators: green lacewings, minute pirate bugs, and ladybird beetle, chilocorus bipustulatus, chilocorus infernalis, chilocorus cacti

Bacterial blight

Control of the disease relies on the avoidance of injuries to the plant which allow bacteria to enter.
Infected areas should be pruned by cutting 1 foot below the edge ofthe canker.
Disease severity can be reduced by protecting plants from freeze injuries during winter.

Two spotted mite

Cultural control:

Maintain proper plant canopy microclimate by using timely training and pruning of the plants.

Biological control:

Predatory mites like amblyseius, metaseiulus, and phytoseiulus; ladybird beetles, stethorus; the minute pirate bugs, orius; the thrips, leptothrips; and the lacewing larvae, chrysopa. Scolothrips sexmaculatus, phytoseiulus persimilis,

In greenhouses, the ghost ant, tapinoma melanocephalum (fabricius are good predator)

Leaf spots

Ensure that land to be used for new kiwi plantings is completely cleared of roots which are greater than 1 inch in diameter.
Ensure kiwi vines are adequately irrigated but not overwatered

Sclerotium rot

Implement deep ploughing during summer.
Use proper vineyard sanitation practices

Botrytis fruit rot

Remove infected leaves, debris and fruit mummies from the vineyard to prevent survival and spread of the pathogen.
Summer pruning is done to open the canopy for increased air movement and to reduce disease incidence

Reproductive stage

Nutrients

Micronutrient deficiency should be corrected by foliar spray of particular micronutrient.
In the bearing orchards, apply fym and other fertilizers according to age of vines as given in table above.
Fertilizers are applied in tree basin about 30 cm away from the tree trunk.
Apply recommended micronutrients, if symptoms are observed.

Weeds

Remove left over weeds from the vineyard to avoid further spread of weed seeds.
Use straw or black polyethylene mulch to avoid weed growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period.
Mulching of vine basins with 10-15 cm thick dry grass also checks weed growth.
