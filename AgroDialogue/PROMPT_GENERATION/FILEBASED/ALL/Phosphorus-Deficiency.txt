Phosphorus Deficiency

Symptoms
Phosphorus deficiency symptoms can appear at all stages but are more pronounced in young plants. Contrary to other nutrients, the symptoms of this deficiency are generally not very striking and can be difficult to identify. In mild cases, a possible indication for this disorder is that plants are dwarfed or stunted. However, no obvious symptoms are observed on leaves. In severe deficiencies, stem and petioles show a dark green to purple discoloration. The lower sides of older leaves also show a purple pigmentation, starting on the tips and margins and later expanding to the rest of the leaf surface. These leaves may become leathery and veins may form a brown netting. In some cases, phosphorus deficiency is characterized by burnt tips and the development of chlorosis as well as necrotic patches on the leaf margins. Flowers and fruits are produced, but fruit yields are low.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Phosphorus levels in soils can be replenished by applying farmyard manure, or other materials (organic mulch, compost and guano) or a combination thereof. The incorporation of residues to the soil after harvest can also contribute to maintaining a positive phosphorus balance in the long term and improve soil structure. The decomposition of organic matter provides a steady supply of plant-available phosphorus.
Chemical Control
Use fertilizers containing phosphorus (P).
Examples: Diammonium phosphate (DAP), Single super phosphate (SSP).
Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
Further recommendations:
It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.

What caused it?
There are differences in susceptibility to phosphorus deficiency between different crops. Roots absorb phosphate ions when they are dissolved in the soil water. Calcareous soils with high calcium concentrations can be poor in phosphorus. Most commonly, however, it is the availability of this nutrient that is limited because phosphorus is adhered to soil particles and cannot be taken up by the plant. Both alkaline soils and acidic soils can show low availability. Soils with low organic matter or iron-rich soils can also be problematic. Cold weather that hinders proper development and function of the roots can also lead to this disorder. Drought conditions or diseases that limit the absorption of water and nutrients by the roots can trigger deficiency symptoms. Soil moisture, in turn, increases the uptake of this nutrient and results in significantly higher yields.

Preventive Measures 
Use varieties that are efficient at mining phosphorus from the soil.
Ensure balanced and efficient fertilization of the crop.
Incorporate plant residues into the soil after harvest.
Use an integrated approach with mineral and organic fertilizers to keep soil nutrient balance.
Lime soils if necessary to reach the appropriate soil pH.
