It grows well in sandy to silt loam soils, which are poor in organic matter and rich in other matters and also considered as drought and salinity resistant plant.the plant has a wide adaptability and if found growing in arid regions under varying conditions.

 

Major producing countries:india, pakistan and uae.

Harvesting/collection of gum resin

Method of harvesting/tapping : the gum resin resides in the ducts located in the soft bark of the tree. It is obtained through a process called tapping. After attaining complete maturity of plant, it is tapped from main stem. The resin ducts occur in the bark portion near cambial layer.

Plant attaining 7.5 cm diameter is suitable for tapping. Usually 1.5 cm deep circular incisions are made on the main stem, not beyond the thickness of the bark. Guggul oozes out from these incisions as a pale yellow, aromatic fluid that quickly solidifies to form a golden brown or reddish brown agglomerate of tears or stalactic pieces. It is collected manually or with spear. The gum-resin is scraped off the wound with the knife. The collection is done at an interval of 10-15 days.

Period of harvesting/collection : the trees are tapped for resin from november through january, and collection continues until may or june through a nick on the bark of the tree.

Yield : a healthy tree yields 250-500 grams of gum-resin in one season, and guggal plants typically begin yielding resin after five years. Starting from the sixth year, yield of gum resin increases from 200 to 400gm per plant.

Processing and value addition

The exuded resin is allowed to dry on the tree before it is collected. Collected resin is cleaned by sieving and hand picking to remove foreign matter, and packed in sacks for transfer to points of sale, either nationally or internationally. The collected gum is graded according to its purity.

Extracts of the gum-resin include compounds known for their hypolipidemic properties, the z-and e-isomers of guggulsterone and its related guggulsterols: guggulsterol i, guggulsterol-ii, guggulsterol-iii, guggulsterol iv, guggulsterol v and guggulsterol vi. A standardized extract of the guggulsterones.
