Transverse Moth
Transverse Moth

Symptoms
Caterpillars feed on the leaves causing defoliation. Feeding on leaves disturbs photosynthesis and as a result the growth and production of the crop is affected negatively.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Biological control does not exist for this minor pest. If it is needed, remove them physically by hand.
Chemical Control
If there are a lot of caterpillars at the early stage of growth, it might be necessary to take action to prevent damage. You should act quickly as soon as you see signs of damage. On big farms that grow okra to sell overseas, a lot of caterpillars at the early stage could cause economic harm. You should contact an agricultural specialist for advice on which products to use, and be sure to follow regulations when using insecticides.

What caused it?
Damage is cause by Xanthodes transversa, a moth. It feeds on several economically important crops most of which are plants in the Malvaceae family. Females deposit their eggs on the underside of the leaves one at a time. Small caterpillars emerge from the eggs after a week. Fully grown up caterpillar is dark green with a distinct yellow stripe along the length of the body and horseshoe shaped black colour markings on both sides of the yellow stripe. Later stages of the caterpillar have somewhat different colour patterns. The young larvae are threadlike and move around a lot. They are feeding on the underside of the leaves, where they can also be found. The caterpillars pupate in the soil and the moth emerges after a couple of weeks. The adult moths are yellow, with three brown arrow-shaped lines across each forewing. Periods of hot, moist weather favour this pest. Even though it doesn't cause a lot of damage, it can still harm crops.

Preventive Measures 
Spot the caterpillars and get rid of them using gloves.
They have such patterns that make them easy to spot.
Keep your plants free of weeds as caterpillars may hide and survive in them.
