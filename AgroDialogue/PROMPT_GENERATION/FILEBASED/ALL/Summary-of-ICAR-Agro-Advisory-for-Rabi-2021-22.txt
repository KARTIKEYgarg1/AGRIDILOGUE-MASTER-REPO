Summary of icar agro-advisory for rabi-2021-22

Introduction

Despite the covid-19 pandemic second wave, indian agriculture has excelled with unprecedented production of food grains attaining the mark of 308.65 million tons (mt) during 2020-21, with record output of rice (122.27 mt), wheat (109.52 mt), coarse grains (51.15 mt) and pulses (25.72 mt) in the food grain basket (4th advance estimate, moa, 2021). Much of this success has been possible owing to governments’ efforts in reaching millions of farmers, making available the inputs, proactive actions and framing farmers’ friendly policies.

The second wave of covid-19 (2021) pandemic posed a serious problem to the nation halting economic activities in one way or the other. However, concerted efforts with suitable technological options could show pathways under such circumstances. Technological options such as resource conservation and climate resilient technologies, promotion of hybrids, bio-fortified varieties, focussed approach on pulses and oilseeds, and crop diversification helped in addressing these challenges.

Major field crops of rabi season

Major field crops cultivated in rabi includes cereals (wheat, barley, maize); oilseeds (mustard, linseed); pulses (chickpea, lentil, and field peas); commercial crops like cumin, coriander, fenugreek, fennel etc. Vegetables and fruit crops.

Proposed interventions

Sustaining pulses production can be ensured by demonstrating production, protection and improved technologies under different farming situation of rabi pulses, judicious use of pesticides for control of insects, pests and diseases. Likewise, targeting oilseed production, will require adoption of planting techniques like broad bed furrow (bbf) method, availability of seeds of improved varieties, participatory seed production, appropriate agronomic practices and targeting non-traditional areas. Impetus to horizontal coverage to oil palm in north eastern states holds good for improving oil seed production.

The focus should also be on rainfed agro-ecosystem which requires holistic planning, prioritization of resources and operationalization of district agricultural contingency plan. If addressed comprehensively, it can help in sustaining/ enhancing production and productivity of pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals in the country apart from wheat during the ensuing rabi season. Availability of seeds of multiple stress tolerant varieties, fertilizers, pesticides and supplement irrigation will add value to the production scenario. For ensuring the set targets, it is imperative to develop micro-level planning and its implementation at grass root level.

To cope with shortages of labour and timely availability of inputs at affordable prices, farmers need to enhance the use of on-farm inputs especially organic manures, adopt best practices for increasing resource use efficiency and reduce cost of cultivation. After harvest of paddy, crop residue management should be given top priority by farmers in order to protect the environment, soil health and its micro-organisms.
