Pear Scab

Symptoms
Pear Scab causes round, olive colored, later brown to black, spots. They grow after the flowering stage on the top and underside of the leaves. The spots can grow together and cause larger tissue damage (necrosis). This can cause early leaf drop. On the fruits, brown spots appear and star-like cracks begin to emerge. The fruits undergo a significant reduction in quality.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
The affected shoots have to be removed.
Chemical Control
You can use fungicides with Difenoconazole or Sulphur to control Pear Scab. Nevertheless, the application of fungicides is difficult in small gardens since the usual spreader cannot provide for a sufficient wetting of big trees and several spraying processes are necessary.

What caused it?
The fungus spreads in the population via spores and hibernates in fallen leaves. Since fungi prefer humid climates, a humid environment increases the risk of infection.

Preventive Measures 
Use less vulnerable sorts.
Apply regularly pruning to promote the ventilation and faster drying of the trees.
Pick up and destroy infected pears and leaves.
