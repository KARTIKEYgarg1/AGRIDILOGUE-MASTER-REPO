Sugarcane: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre – sowing*

Nutrients
Soil test based nutrient recommendations should be followed also, • apply organic manures @ 8 to 10 tonnes/acre treated with trichoderma. • press mud can also be used as organic manure @ 2 tonnes/acre which is particularly useful in saline alkali soils. • sugarcane trash can be used as a mulch. Spray trash with 32 kg urea, 40 kg single super phosphate and 4 kg decomposing culture/acre for better decomposition. • sugarcane trash can also be incorporated while making organic manure along with press mud and use of earthworms for preparing vermicompost. • crops like sun hemp and dhaincha are grown as green manure crop. Green manure crops can be grown as a sole crop and buried in the field at an age of 1.5 to 2 months (before flowering).

Weeds
Cultural control: • deep ploughing in summer and left undisturbed 20-25 days. • cross ploughing of land followed by clod crushing and 1-2 harrowing. • at the time of field preparation, adopt stale seed bed technique ie. Pre sowing irrigation followed by shallow tillage to minimize the weeds menace in field.

Sowing*

Nutrients
• use biofertilizers such as acetobactor, azotobactor, azospirillium, bacillus or pseudomonas. Either of these biofertilizers or in combination should be used at the time of sowing @ 5 kg / acre for sett treatment or in soil along with fym. • basal application of npk is done on soil test basis. • in sugarcane, fertilizer should be applied as per the table mentioned below. • apply zinc sulphate @10 kg/acre in soil at the time of planting. • in soils deficient with micro nutrients like iron, zinc, manganese, copper, molybdenum and boron, 10 kg ferrous sulphate, 8 kg zinc sulphate, 4 kg manganese sulphate, 4 kg copper sulphate,1 kg, sodium molybdate and 2 kg borax per hectare should be applied. • micro nutrient fertilizers should be mixed with well decomposed dung manure or compost and applied as basal dose.

Weeds
Cultural control: • adopt proper crop rotation and intercropping. • avoid mono cropping. • follow recommended agronomic practices. • if intercropping has been adopted no chemical herbicide should be use in the field. Chemical control: • 2, 4-d dimethyl amine salt 58% sl @2.52 l in 200 l of water/acre • 2, 4-d sodium salt technical (having 2, 4-d acid 80 % w/w) (earlier registered as 80%wp) @1-1.3 kg in 240-360 l of water/acre • hexazinone 13.2% + diuron 46.8 % wp @800 g in 200 l of water/acre • 2, 4-d ethyl ester 38 % ec (having 2,4-d acid 34 % w/w) @1.412-2.116 l in 200 l of water/acre • diuron 80% wp @ 0.8-1.6 kg in 2.4 l of water/acre note: herbicide should be selected as per the weed species in previous season in the same field as per recommendation of cibrc.

Soil &amp; seed borne diseases, insect pests
Cultural control: • select tolerant / resistant varieties • select the seed cane from aerated steam treated nurseries • crop like potato, mustard, lentil, pulses and winter vegetables can be grown as inter crop during autumn planted sugarcane i.e. Oct-nov &amp;, sunflower, soybean, green gram, groundnut etc. During feb-march planted sugarcane to reduce the pests population and to conserve bioagents of white woolly aphid and other pests • adopt paired row method of planting

Nematodes
Cultural control: • deep ploughing, solarisation, flooding, crop rotation and apply organic manure. • under wetland conditions, intercropping with sun hemp or marigold or daincha • apply pressmud at 6 t/acre or poultry manure @ 0.8 t/acre or neem cake 0.8 t/acre or poultry manure @ 0.4 t/acre before last ploughing. Biological control: • application of biocontrol agents like pochonia chlamydosporia, paecilomyces lilacinus or trichoderma viride or pseudomonas fl uorescens @ 4 kg/acre at the time of planting mixed with moist fym or cured pressmud and distributed uniformly helps in suppressing the plant parasitic nematodes.

Termites &amp; white grubs**
Cultural control: • remove stubble and debris of previous crops • dig the termatoria and destroy the queen. Physical control: • locate and destroy the termite colony and affected setts. • set up light trap for trapping of white grubs adults and kill them in kerosene oil water. • at onset of monsoon collect and destroy the adult beetles by shaking the branches of trees on which they settle during night. Biological control: • entomopathogenic nematodes (epns) can be sprayed at the rate of 100 million nematodes per acre, in root grub and termite infested sugarcane fields or • epn infected cadavers of galleria/corcyra larvae containing live infective juveniles (ijs) are implanted in soil at plant bases at the rate of four cadavers per plant during may/ june and/or september for sugarcane root grub control. Chemical control: for termite: • chlorantraniliprole 18.5% sc @ 200-250 ml in 400 l of water/acre or clothianidin 50%wdg @100 g in 400 l of water/acre or imidacloprid 70% ws @28-42 g in 40-60 l of water/acre or imidacloprid 17.8% sl @ 140 ml in 750 l of water/acre or chlorpyrifos 20% ec @ 2.5 l/acre for white grubs: • fipronil 40% + imidacloprid 40% wg@175-200 g in 400-500 l of water/acre or phorate 10% cg @ 10,000 g/acre

Harvesting
• deep harvesting. • removal of late shoots and water shoots.

After harvesting

• avoid trash burning to preserve the natural enemies • stubble shaving should be done at ground level. • destroy the stubble in borer and white grub infested fi eld.
