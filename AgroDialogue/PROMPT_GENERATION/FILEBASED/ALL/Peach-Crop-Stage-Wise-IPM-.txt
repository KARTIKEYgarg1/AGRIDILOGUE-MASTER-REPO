Activity

Pre- planting

 

Common cultural practices: 

Deep ploughing of fields during summer. 
Field sanitation, rogueing 
Use resistant/tolerant varieties. 
Grow the attractant, repellent plants around the field bunds. Apply manures and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations

Nutrients

Nutrient should be applied on the basis of soil test report and recommendation for the particular agro-climatic zone. 
Prepare land by ploughing and harrowing. 
The pits are dug in summer about a fortnight before planting and left undisturbed for solarization.
Pits of about 1m x 1m x 1m size are dug at a distance of 4 to 5 meter in square system of planting. 
Under high density planting pits may be dug at a spacing of 4m x 1m.

Weeds

Ploughing, harrowing, leveling and removing the weeds before planting.

Termite

Cultural control:

Mechanical control: 

Locate and destroy the termite colony. 
Collect and destroy the termite affected setts from the field.

Planting

 

Common cultural practices: 

Use healthy and certified plants 
Grow resistant/tolerant varieties 
Plant early maturing cultivars i.e, prabhat, partap, florda prince, early grande, flordasun and shan-e-punjab for fruit fly. 
Irrigation should be done by ring method to reduce possibility of collar rot 
Avoid plating in low-lying areas and flooding. 
Do not delay irrigation until the crop exhibits moisture stress symptoms. 

Common mechanical practices: 

Remove and destroy the diseased orchard.

Nutrients

Planting is done in pits already filled with top soil and organic manure during the months of december- january.
Mycorrhiza culture should be applied at the time of planting or a basket of soil taken from old peach orchard is added to each pit to ensure mycorrhizal association with peach roots. 
At the time of planting, manures and fertilizers are applied @ 50 kg fym or compost, 20 g n + 15 g p + 15 g k per plant.

Weeds

Use weed free seedlings for planting. 
Remove existing weeds in and around the pits at the time of planting. 
During the initial 2-4 years, grow the intercrop like pea, bean, soybean, and cowpea.

Soil borne diseases and nematodes

Resistant varieties 
Use healthy infestation-free plants. 
Application of neem cake @ 80 kg/acre for nematode control.

Application of trichoderma harzianum / viride and pseudomonas fluorescens for treatment of seed/seedling/planting materials in the nurseries and field application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).

Fruiting stage

Nutrient management

For mature trees, a mixture of 40 kg farmyard manure, 500g n, 250 g p2o5 and 200 g k is recommended. The farmyard manure should be applied during december-january along with full dose of p and k. Nitrogen is applied in 2 parts, first half at 2-3 weeks before flowering and the remaining half a month later. 
The band application of nitrogenous fertilizers should be preferred over broadcasting. 
Under rainfed conditions, apply n through 1 or 2 foliar sprays of urea (0.5%) after fruit set.
Apply recommended micronutrients, if symptoms are observed. Fruits are deformed under boron deficiency. 
To avoid boron deficiency, apply h2bo3 (0.1%) as foliar spray.

Weed management

Remove weeds around the plants. 
Use straw or black polyethylene mulch to avoid weed growth and to maintain soil moisture for longer period. 
Mulching tree basins with 10-15 cm thick dry grass also checks weed growth.
