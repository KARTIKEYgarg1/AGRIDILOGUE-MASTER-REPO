Description of innovation
A local type of bitter gourd known as 'jhaar karela' is found climbing on bushes in sandy area as a wild plant. It is known for its medicinal value for diabetic patients. This farmer has adopted the wild cultivar and brought it under commercial cultivation. He has collected the seed from a wild plant growing as weed from southwestern districts of punjab. He had even travelled to rajasthan to collect the seed. He made the selection and developed a variety of his own. He has been growing 'jhaar karela' for the past 5 year on an acreage of 0.5-1.5 ha annually. It is a vine type crop and requires staking for successful cultivation. Mr. Dalip singh has developed a system of bamboo staking on concrete foundation to trail the vines.

Practical utility of innovation
He is getting an average yield of 75 qtls/ha from the crop. He had been marketing the produce himself with his own conveyance. He made a packing size of 1, 2 and 5 kg and sold them in the adjoining markets. The average price of his produce (2009-10) was rs. 5000/- per qtl and thus from an area of 1 ha, he earned rs. 375000/- as gross income. With net return of about rs. 200000/ - per ha.
