Advisories related to major horticulture crops

Pomegranate:

Take pruning for ambiya bahar in pomegranate. Use improved and high yielding varieties like bhagwa and super bhagwa. Give stress of 30 to 60 days according to soil type. Give light irrigation for flowering. Precaution should be taken so that water stress condition may not occur in pomegranate orchard. Remove suckers shoot in pomegranate orchard. Apply fym @ 40-50 kg per plant. Apply fertilizer dose of 400:200:200 g / plant after irrigation. Nitrogen should be given in two splits. Take a spray of potassium nitrate @ 15 gm per litre of water.

Apply fertilizer dose of 400:200:200 g / plant after irrigation. Nitrogen should be given in two splits.

Mango:

Organic mulching should be done, and the orchard should be irrigated during early in the morning, at evening or during night hours. To protect the mango fruits from the incidence of fruit fly, install “rakshak fruit fly trap” developed by university @ 4 traps per hectare. Fallen fruits should be collected and destroyed to keep orchard clean.

Banana:

To protect the crop from the severe cold wave, make a smoke in the orchard to increase the temperature in the evening and apply irrigation at night to raise the temperature. Organic mulching should be done in banana orchard. Irrigate banana orchard during early in the morning, at evening or during nighttime.

Grapes:

Management of october pruning in grape orchard should be done as per availability of water. During rest period, provide only need based irrigation to protect the existing leaves from drying, and contribute towards increasing the reserves of the vines through photosynthetic activity. Care should be taken to reduce/stop the water in case new growth is observed on the shoot. If rainfall exceeds 2.5 mm, no irrigation should be applied especially during rest period.

Advisories related to livestock and fisheries

Dairy cattle: vaccination of cattle to protect them from deadly viral foot and mouth disease should be completed in septemberoctober and march-april twice in the year.
Goat: vaccination of goats to protect them from deadly viral ppr disease (bulkandi) disease should be completed once in every three years.
Poultry: vent pecking is hazardous and economic loss-making bad habits of newly developed poultry breeds like grampriya, kaveri, vanaraja and giriraja. To avoid this loss, poultry farmers should follow debeaking of birds and sufficient vitamins (a, d, e, k) and minerals (ca, p, na) should be given to the birds through feed or water regularly.
Fodder management: to avoid the annual green fodder scarcity to domestic animals, high yielding napier fodder varieties like bnh10, phule gunwant and dhn-6 should be cultivated by farmers on 0.04 ha area per animal.
Fisheries: farm pods created under nhm, and state department of agriculture should be utilised for fish farming where water is available throughout the year. Mixed fish breeds like rohu, katla, mrigal and cyprinus can be grown in fishponds. Biofloc fish farming should be adopted by small and marginal farmers. 

Advisories related to allied enterprises:

One spray of growth hormone serimore @ one ampule / 50 dfl should be applied at the time of fifth feeding after forth mode for increasing yield and quality of cocoons. One spray of growth hormone sampoorna @ one ampule / 50 dfl should be applied at the time of 5-10 % sampling of cocoon formation for uniform growth of silkworms. Cocoons should be harvested after five days of cocoon formation. Cocoon harvester machine should be used for harvesting of cocoons for saving the labour.

Advisories related to post harvest management and value addition

: sweet orange fruits should be kept in cold storage at -6 0c for 90 days to increase its shelf life. Waxing can also be done.
Grapes: the fresh fruits should be converted into resins. The fruits can also be kept in cold storage to increase its shelf life.
Aonla: aonla fruits should be processed and converted into value added products like aonla candy, aonla pulp, aonla syrup, aonla powder, aonla supari, etc.
Pomegranate: pomegranates should be used to make value added products like anardana, pomegranate juice, etc.
Vegetables: tomatoes should be processed to make tomato ketch up, tomato sauce, etc. Green and red chilli should also be processed to make value added products like chilli sauce, red chilli powder, green chilli paste, etc.
Cereals and pulses: sorghum and wheat grains should be stored at below 14 % moisture for long term storage. Improved grain storage bags should be used for storage of wheat, rice, etc. Pulses crops like pigeon pea, chickpea, green gram, black gram should be processed to convert into dal for higher returns. Innovative packaging should be used for fetching more prices in the market.

Advisories related to farm mechanization and soil water conservation

Use minimum tillage operations, avoid ploughing for land preparation to protect land from evaporation losses and to conserve the soil moisture.
Use bbf planter for sowing of chickpea for in situ moisture conservation.
Chickpea crop should be irrigated through sprinkler irrigation at critical stages like flowering and pod filling for increasing yield wherever irrigation is available.
Use of reapers / combine harvesters should be preferred for harvesting of crops like wheat, chickpea, safflower, etc.
Rabi onion should be sown with crida tractor drawn onion seed planter to save labour expenses and to achieve more work efficiency.

Advisories related to farm women

Farm women should use cycle hoe for intercultural operations in field crops to reduce the drudgery.
Use serrated sickle for harvesting of jowar, bajra and similar crops which reduces the drudgery of farm women.
Shed net farmers may use vegetable transplanter to reduce drudgery in transplanting, time, money &amp; labour cost.
Each farm woman should develop a model nutritional garden in their farm or home premises to enhance nutritional status and nutrition security of farm family.
Nutri-cereals should be added in cropping systems. Nutri-cereals like finger millet, fox tail millet, little millet, etc. Can be grown in the rabi season.
Farm women should grow sorghum crop for hurda (tender roasted grains) on small area and sale it with attractive packing to earn extra income. Similar practice can be done in case of chickpea.
