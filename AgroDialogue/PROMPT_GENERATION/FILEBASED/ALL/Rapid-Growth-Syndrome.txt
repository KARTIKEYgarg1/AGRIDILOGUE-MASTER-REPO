Rapid Growth Syndrome

Symptoms
The sharp acceleration in plant growth rate occurs. Maize leaves fail to unfurl properly, and the whorl becomes tightly wrapped and twisted. Rapidly growing new leaves cannot emerge and cause the whorl to bend and twist as they force their way out. Leaves that have been trapped in the whorl will often be bright yellow when they emerge, making them very noticeable in the field. Affected leaves may wrinkle near the base and will remain that way throughout the growing season.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
As with many weather-related stress effects, it is common for some hybrids to be more prone to rapid growth syndrome than others. Choose the appropriate variety or hybrid for your region.
Chemical Control
Chemical Control is not relevant to the case.

What caused it?
The damage is usually associated with an abrupt transition from cool temperatures to warmer conditions resulting in a sharp acceleration in plant growth rate. The rapidly growing new leaves cannot emerge and will cause the whorls to bend and twist as they try to force their way out. The syndrome usually occurs between the 5th to 6th vegetative growth stage but can also be observed as late as the 12th vegetative growth stage. There are usually no serious negative impacts on yields. Note that twisted whorls can also have other causes, most notably herbicide injury.

Preventive Measures 
Prevention measures are not applicable.
Leaves of affected plants usually unfurl after a few days.
