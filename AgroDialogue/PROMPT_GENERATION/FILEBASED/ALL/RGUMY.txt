Background

World over, micro and small enterprises (mses) are recognized as an important/constituent of the national economies, contributing significantly to employment expansion and poverty alleviation. Recognizing the importance of micro and small enterprises, which constitute an important segment of indian economy in terms of their contribution to country’s industrial production, exports, employment and creation of entrepreneurial base, the central and state governments have been implementing several schemes and programmes for promotion and development of these enterprises.

The small scale industries in india, including the tiny or micro industries and service/business entities, collectively referred as micro and small enterprises (mses), have along history of promoting inclusive, spatially widespread and employment-oriented economic growth. In terms of employment generation, this segment is next only to agriculture. Entrepreneurship development and training is one of the key elements for development and promotion of micro and small enterprises, particularly, the first generation entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurship development programmes (edps) of various durations are being organized on regular basis by a number of organizations e.g. National and state level entrepreneurship development institutes (edis), micro, small and medium enterprises development institutes (msmedis) [earlier known as small industries service institutes (sisis)], national and state level industrial development corporations, banks and other training institutions/agencies in private and public sector etc., to create new entrepreneurs by cultivating their latent qualities of entrepreneurship and enlightening them on various aspects necessary for setting up micro and small enterprises. Besides, various industrial training institutes (itis), other private training institutions are also organizing vocational training (vt) programmes, skill development programmes (sdps) and entrepreneurshipcum- skill development programmes (esdps).

However, there are still wide spread variations in the success rate, in terms of actual setting up and successful running of enterprises, by the edp/sdp/esdp trained entrepreneurs. It has been observed that entrepreneurs particularly new entrepreneurs, generally face difficulties in availing full benefits under available schemes of the governments / financial institutions, completing and complying with various formalities and legal requirements under various laws/regulations, in selection of appropriate technology, tie-up with buyers and sellers etc. In order to bridge the gap between the aspirations of the potential entrepreneurs and the ground realties, there is a need to support and nurture the potential first generation as well as existing entrepreneurs by giving them handholding support, particularly during the initial stages of setting up and managing their enterprises.

Objective

To provide information, support, guidance and assistance to first generation entrepreneurs as well as other existing entrepreneurs through an ‘udyami helpline’ (a call centre for msmes), to guide them regarding various promotional schemes of the government, procedural formalities required for setting up and running of the enterprise and help them in accessing bank credit etc.
