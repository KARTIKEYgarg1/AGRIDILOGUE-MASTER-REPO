Direct employment opportunities for about 40,000 people will be created under the scheme through project activities like expansion & modernisation of existing milk processing facilities, setting up of new processing plants, establishment of manufacturing facilities for value added products and setting up of bulk milk coolers (bmcs) at village level.

About 2 lakh indirect employment opportunities will be created on account of expansion of milk and milk product marketing operations from existing tier i, ii & iii to tier iv, v & vi cities/towns etc. This will lead to deployment of more marketing staff by milk cooperatives, appointment of distributors and opening of additional milk booths/retail outlets in urban/rural locations. With the increase in milk procurement operations of the milk cooperatives, there would be generation of additional manpower employment for supervision of increased milk procurement operations, transportation of milk from villages to processing units, and increased input delivery services like artificial insemination (ai) services, veterinary services, etc.
