Adoption of high yielding groundnut variety dharani

Introduction

Ms. Rashmita sahu, is a small farmer but very keen to adopt new agricultural practices. She participated in many training programme organized by kvk ganjam on pulse and oilseeds production technologies.

Source of motivation

After undergoing a number of training programmes on pulse and oilseeds production technologies, ms. Rashmita sahu had shown interest in cultivating groundnut with new high yielding variety (hyv) and improved package of practices as guided by scientists of kvk, ganjam. Kvk scientists helped her in all technical aspects to grow groundnut, var. Dharani and provided other inputs.

Technology and innovation adopted

Training provided by kvk, ganjam convinced her that if all inputs are properly used and the field is looked after well, she would certainly succeed.
She used the following inputs as advised and supplied.
Use of hyv groundnut, var. Dharani, 75 kg/ ha
 by cloropyriphos
Method of seed sowing: - line sowing
Application of thiamethoxam @ 150 gram/ha for sucking pests, hexaconazole@ 1 litre/ha. For tikka disease

Contributing factors

Using hyv groundnut variety dharani which is drought tolerant, having uniform maturity, attractive pods and moderate stature.
Adoption of recommended packages of practices ensured better yield

Influence on other farmers

Farmers in the village developed interest in scientific cultivation of groundnut with good high yielding variety and proper technology
