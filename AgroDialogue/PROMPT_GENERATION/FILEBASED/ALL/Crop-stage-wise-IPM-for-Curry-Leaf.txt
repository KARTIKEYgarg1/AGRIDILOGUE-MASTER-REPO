Crop stage-wise ipm for curry leaf

Management 
Activity

Pre-sowing

Nutrients

The field is ploughed 3-4 times to get a fine tilth. Before last ploughing well decomposed farm yard manure (fym) is applied @ 8 t/acre. 
Pit size of 30 x30x30 cm is dug one to two months before planting at a spacing of 1.2 x 1.5 m (in case of sole crop) or 1.5 x 3 m or 1.5 x 2m 
Apply 26: 9: 8 kg n: p: k/acre acre at the time of planting

Weeds

Remove or incorporate previous crop residues before planting.
Plan to grow suitable intercrops like legumes, ginger, tapioca etc.

Resting stages of pests, soil-borne fungus

Deep summer ploughing 
Soil solarization: cover the beds with polythene sheet of 45 gauge (0.45 mm) thickness for three weeks before sowing for soil solarization which will help in reducing the soil-borne pests.

* applying trichoderma as seed and nursery treatment and pseudomonas fluorescens as seed, nursery treatment and soil application (if commercial products are used, check for label claim. However, biopesticides produced by farmers for own consumption in their fields, registration is not required).

Vegetative stage

Nutrients

Apply 4 kg of fym, 5: 10: 10 g n: p: k/plant and mix with soil after every harvest.

Weeds &amp; inter cultivation

Periodical hoeing/ hand weeding from pits should be done after every irrigation. 
In the first year intercropping with pulses can be grown. 
After attaining 1 m height, the terminal bud is cut off to encourage basal branching. In total 5-6 branches are maintained per bush.

Leaf spot

Cultural control:

Disease-free seed and seedlings should always be used 

Biological control: 

Preventive spray of tobacco decoction could be sprayed (dose). 
Citrus oil at 1360 ppm inhibited the maximum growth of the fungus followed by lemongrass oil at 1720 ppm and peppermint at 2260 ppm, respectively
Spray nske 5%

Tortoise beetle

Mechanical control:

Hand picking of larva 

Biological control: 

Conserve parasitoids such as trichogramma evanescens (egg), telenomus sp (egg), distatrix papilionis (larval), brachymeria sp (larval), pteromalus sp (pupal), 
Spray nske 5% or neem oil @ 1-2 %

Leaf eating caterpillar (citrus butterfly)

Cultural control: 

Yellow sticky traps @4-5 /acre for monitoring

 biological control: 

Conserve predators such as predatory wasps, lady beetles, lacewing, syrphid fly larvae. 
Horticultural mineral oils @ 0.5 -1% 
Dusting of cow dung ash. 
Spray nske 5% or 0.03 % azadirachtin 
Application of fish oil rosin soap at one part in 25 parts of water is highly effective against this sucking pest.

Citrus psylla or psyllid

Cultural control: 

Close monitoring and pruning of the infested plant parts

 biological control: 

Conserve natural predators such as predatory wasps, lacewings, ladybugs (chilocoris nigritus), predatory ants, predatory mites etc. 
Horticultural mineral oils @ 0.5-1%

Scale insects

Biological control: 

Predatory wasps, syrphid/hover flies, ladybugs or mealybug destroyers (a conccinellid, cryptolaemus montrouzieri) etc.

Mealybug

Biological control:

Predatory midges, green lacewings, lady bird beetles, hover flies, wasps etc.

Citrus leafminer

Biological control:

Conserve parasitoids such as closterocerus spp., cirrospilius spp., pnigalio spp., chrysocharis spp., and sympieses spp. 
Spray nske 5%

Aphid

Biological control:

Conserve parasitoids such as aphidius colemani, diaeretiella spp. Aphelinus spp. Etc. 
Conserve predators such as anthocorid bugs/pirate bugs (orius spp.), mirid bugs, syrphid/hover flies, green lacewings (mallada basalis and chrysoperla carnea), predatory coccinellids (stethorus punctillum), staphylinid beetle (oligota spp.), predatory cecidomyiid fly (aphidoletis aphidimyza) and predatory gall midge, (feltiella minuta), earwigs, ground beetles, rove beetles, spiders, wasps etc.

Reproductive stage (in subsequent seasons)

Nutrient management

Apply 4 kg of fym, 5: 10:10 g n: p: k/plant and mix with soil after every harvest.

Weed management

Need based hoeing and weeding should be done around the plant to keep it weed free.
