Mango: crop stage-wise ipm

 

Management
Activity

Pre-sowing*

Common cultural practices: •destroy the alternate host plants •sow the ecological engineering plants •sow sorghum/maize/pearl millet in 4 rows all around the main crop as guard/barrier crop •plough the field before planting to destroy existing weeds in the field. •plough deep after harvest to bury the pupae. •deep summer ploughing of field reduces the incidence of mealy bug and soil-borne pathogens. •seed nuts must be collected during peak period of harvest and sun dried for two to three days. •medium size nuts (7-9 gm) may be selected to get vigorously growing seedlings. •seed nuts should be soaked over night in water before sowing. •sow the soaked nuts in the polythene bags filled with potting mixture. •seedlings will be ready for grafting 40-50 days after germination. •irrigate the orchards as and when required •provide proper shade, irrigation &amp; drainage. •rogue out diseased seedling. •employ locally made rat traps. •use resistant/tolerant varieties •destroy the alternate host plants

Cultural control: •avoid harvesting of immature fruits cool fruits immediately after harvest and store in well ventilated containers.

Gummosis
Cultural control: •the diseased bark / portion should be removed or cleaned and pasted withcow dung paste.

Mango malformation
Cultural control: •the floral malformed panicles/ vegetative malformed shoots should be pruned and burnt which reduces the incidence of malformation. •application of naa (200 ppm) in the first week of october (before bud differentiation stages) followed by de-blossoming in the late december or january reduces the incidence of malformation.

Maturation *

Mango shoot caterpillar
Cultural control: •keep orchard clean and healthy. •removal and destruction of egg masses.

Fruit fly
Cultural control: •prior to harvest (30-40 days) collect and disposed off infested and fallen fruits to prevent further multiplication and carry-over of population. •ploughing of orchard during november-december to expose pupae to sun‟s heat which kills them. •if infestation is heavy, bait splash on the trunk only, once or twice at weekly interval is recommended. To prepare bait splash, mix 100 gm of jaggery in one litre of water and add 1 ml of deltamethrin by using an old broom. •managing fruit flies also reduces anthracnose disease and prevents late fruit fall. Mechanical control: •male annihilation technique: set up fly trap using methyl eugenol. Prepare methyl eugenol 1 ml/l of water + 1 ml of malathion solution. •take 10 ml of this mixture per trap and keep them at 25 different places in one ha between 6 and 8 am. •collect and destroy the adult flies. Physical control: •hot water treatment of fruit at 48 ± 1 ºc for 4-5min. Biological control: •use methyl eugenal pheromone trap@4/acre
