Banded Chlorosis

Symptoms
Symptoms are characterized by light green to white horizontal areas on the both leaf sides. The discolored bands are seen near the base of the older leaves and progressively close to successively younger leaves. Within a field, symptoms can be seen on different plants at similar heights from the ground. Dead spots and shredding are noticed within the patches or bands of a few affected leaves. Shorter canes are usually free from this abnormality.

Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. This damage does not significantly affect the plant.

What caused it?
Banded chlorosis is a psychological disorder which is primarily caused by a sudden drop in temperature. It affects portions of unrolled leaves within the spindle. The damage is usually seen only weeks later, when the leaves grow out, and does not significantly affect the crop yields and other mechanisms. Temperatures between 2.7 and 7Â°C are favorable for the abnormality. Fields in upland areas are affected more than plots in lowlands. The disorder may also be caused by heat on some sensitive cultivars, particularly where leaves bend naturally.

Preventive Measures 
Practice early planting.
