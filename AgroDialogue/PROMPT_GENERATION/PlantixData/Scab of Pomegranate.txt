Scab of Pomegranate

Symptoms
Symptoms are initially appeared as rusty spots on fruits which later become raised scab lesions. Spots enlarge and merge forming the scab-like and cork-like symptoms appear on flowers and fruits (both immature and mature). The disease can cause deformed young fruits as well as disturbance of pollination. The scab color is grey or brown. No internal fruit symptoms are observed. Brown lesions on leaves and brunches/twigs can be spotted but are not characteristic of the disease.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
To this day no effective and applicable biological control has been reported.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Although there is a claim for lack of information on chemical management, some fungicidal sprays seem to have a noted effect. In particular carbendazim (0.1%), thiophanate methyl (0.1%), bitertanol (0.1%), chlorothalonil (0.2%) at 15 days interval from flower initiation stage could possibly control the disease. When using a pesticide always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval. Always, follow regional regulation on pest management.

What caused it?
The Species of Elsinoë are phytopathogens causing scabs on many plants, including some economically important crops such as avocado, citrus, grapevines, ornamentals, field crops and woody hosts. Additional studies are needed to unravel the epidemiology of this disease and to determine the exact economic impact on commercial production. Lack on the epidemiology insights is on account of the lack of fertile structures of Elsinoë specimens collected form infected fields. It has to be noted that scab-like symptoms decrease crop marketability, thus further research is needed. It has been observed that rainy weather induces the rate of spread of the disease.

Preventive Measures 
Sanitation measures should be followed strictly.
All infected leaves, fruits should be collected and burnt.
Pruning of diseased branches/twigs is important to reduce the source of infection.
With more research on epidemiology of this specific agent more efficient prevention measures in pomegranate will be available.
