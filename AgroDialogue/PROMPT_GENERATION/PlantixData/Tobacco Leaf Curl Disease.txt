Tobacco Leaf Curl Disease

Symptoms
Infected plants exhibit leaf thickening, downward leaf curling, vein swelling as well as stunting symptoms. Plant height is reduced and internodes are shortened. Numerous prominent leafy outgrowths develop in the form of stalk-shaped structures along the veins on the lower side of leaves. The leaves show greening and vein thickening causing depressions on the upper surface of leaves. The inflorescence is also stunted.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Control the vector population to decrease the disease incidence. Plant barrier crops, such as sunflower and castor around tobacco nurseries. Also, cover the nursery with nylon sets.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Apply acephate to the soil or foliage to decrease the incidence and spread of the disease. Apply Furada [carbofuran] to kill the aleyrodid vector.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by begomoviruses that belong to the family Geminiviridae. The virus is transmitted in nature by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. The virus can spread rapidly through the vector due to numerous host in nature.

Preventive Measures 
Remove infected plants.
