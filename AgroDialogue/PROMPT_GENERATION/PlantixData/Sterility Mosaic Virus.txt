Sterility Mosaic Virus

Symptoms
In the early stage of the disease, the veins of young leafs turn light green. In the further progress a light and dark green mosaic pattern develops. Leaves and branches become smaller, which gives the plant a stunted and bushy appearance. The plants may not produce flowers or pods.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Direct treatment of viral diseases is not possible, but it is possible to reduce the risk of infection via mites. Predators of the vector mites are frequently found in the same environments as the Brevipalpus species. Formulations containing the entomopathogenic fungi of the genus Metarhizium or Hirsutella thompsonii can also be used to reduce populations.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Direct treatment of viral diseases is not possible, but it is possible to reduce the risk of infection via mites. You can apply acaricides like Kelthane, Tedion @1 ml per litre of water to kill mites.

What caused it?
The symptoms are caused by the Sterility mosaic virus. The virus is transmitted through Eriophyid mite. Infection risk increases when pigeonpea is intercropped with millet or sorghum. In warm and dry periods, symptoms are suppressed, while shade and humidity encourage the multiplication of the virus.

Preventive Measures 
Grow resistant genotypes/cultivars like ICP 7035, VR3, Purple 1, DA11, DA32, ICP 6997, Bahar, BSMR 235, ICP 7198, PR 5149, ICP 8861 and Bhavanisagar 1.
Maintain a 30-40 cm distance between the lines.
Control mite population.
In an early stage you should uproot infected plants and destroy them to prevent further spreading of the virus.
Clear all plant residues of affected plants after harvesting.
