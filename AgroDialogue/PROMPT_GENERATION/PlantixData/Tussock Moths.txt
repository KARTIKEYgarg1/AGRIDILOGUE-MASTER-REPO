Tussock Moths

Symptoms
Caterpillars chew foliage, giving plants a clipped appearance. They feed on many species of crops and trees. High numbers of larvae can cause defoliation. Larvae may also take small bites out of young fruit which can cause the fruit to change colours and the skin to become rough.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Bacillus thuringiensis can be used to get rid of the tussock moth bugs, especially when they are still young. Bt only kills caterpillars that feed on sprayed foliage and a second application is recommended after 7 to 10 days due to its short life after application. Spinosad is also effective but can harm bees and natural enemies. It is toxic to bees for several hours after drying. Spinosad should not be applied to flowering plants.
Chemical Control
Tussock moth infestations are typically controlled by natural enemies, so using insecticides is not usually necessary unless the plants are young and show problems in growth. If there is heavy defoliation, chemical control may be the only solution. It is important to find which kinds of pesticides are allowed for this use in your region. Some active ingredients that have been mentioned in literature for controlling tussock moths include Chlorantraniliprole, Methoxyfenozide, and Phosmet. Note that sprays used to control other spring caterpillar problems may also control tussock moths.

What caused it?
Tussock moths, mainly in the Orgyia, Dasychira, and Euproctis genera, cause damage to plants worldwide. They adult moths have hair all over their body and can be brown, grey, or white. The Tussock moth goes through several stages in its life cycle. The moths lay their eggs in masses in the fall, and the eggs overwinter until the following spring. When the weather warms up, the eggs hatch and the young caterpillars emerge. The caterpillars begin to feed on the leaves of crops, trees and shrubs, growing and moulting as they eat. As they grow, they develop the characteristic tufts of hair that give the tussock moth its name. After a few weeks of feeding, the caterpillars will form a cocoon. In the cocoon, the caterpillar transforms into an adult moth. The adult moth will emerge from the cocoon and mate, and the female will lay eggs to start the cycle anew. Moth populations tend to increase in localised areas due to the females being unable to fly.

Preventive Measures 
It is important to be careful when dealing with tussock moths because their caterpillars have hairs that can irritate human skin and easily detach when touched.
Wear protective clothing and avoid inhaling any caterpillar parts.
Look for egg masses and young caterpillars and remove them.
Monitoring for the pest is always the best approach.
