Leaf-footed Bugs

Symptoms
Leaf-footed bugs can cause a range of symptoms in crops, depending on the species of bug, the stage of development, and the type of plant being affected. Here are some common symptoms of leaf-footed bug damage in crops. Leaf-footed bugs can cause slowed growth in plants, particularly in young plants that are still developing. This can result in smaller yields or a delayed harvest. These bugs can cause discoloration and deformity in fruit. Affected fruit may appear discolored, misshapen, or have small sunken areas on the surface. This can make the fruit less marketable because of these visible damages. Leaf-footed bugs can cause damage to the leaves and stems of plants. This can result in yellowing or browning of the leaves, wilting, and even death of the plant. In addition, some species of leaf-footed bugs can transmit plant diseases, which can further damage crops and reduce yields.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Insecticidal soap or botanicals, such as neem oil or pyrethrin, may provide some control of young nymphs only. One of the best ways to control leaf-footed bugs is to remove their eggs.
Chemical Control
Chemical control of leaf-footed bugs involves using insecticides to kill or repel the pests. There are several insecticides that are effective against leaf-footed bugs, including pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and spinosad. These insecticides can be applied as sprays, dusts, or baitst's important to follow the instructions on the label carefully when using insecticides. Be sure to wear protective clothing and gear, and avoid spraying when the weather is windy or rainy. Also, be sure to follow any restrictions on the label regarding the timing of the application and the number of times you can apply the product. While chemical control can be effective in reducing leaf-footed bug populations, it is important to note that overuse or misuse of insecticides can have negative impacts, including non-target insects, wildlife, and humans. Therefore, it's important to use insecticides judiciously and as part of an integrated pest management approach that includes cultural and biological controls.

What caused it?
Leaf-footed bugs are insects that have flattened, leaf-shaped back legs.. They are medium-sized insects, usually about 20 mm long. They are usually brown or green, and they feed on the sap of plants, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The life cycle of a leaf-footed bug starts when the female lays eggs on plants. The eggs are about 1.4 mm long, oval-shaped, bronze to dark brown and are laid in rows. The eggs hatch into small nymphs, which look like smaller versions of the adult bugs. The nymphs go through several transformations before becoming adults. During each transformation, the nymph sheds its old skin and grows a new one. As they grow, they start to look more like adults, and they develop wings. Once the leaf-footed bugs become adults, they mate and lay eggs, and the cycle starts again. Leaf-footed bugs can go through several generations per year, depending on the climate and the availability of food. They are more likely to cause problems when it rains a lot. Adults come out of hiding in the spring after spending the winter under dead plants or mulch. If the winter is warm, more adult insects survive and can cause more problems. Some types of leaf-footed bugs only reproduce on weeds, while others reproduce on vegetables. Fruit damage is the main concern with these insects, and they are most likely to cause problems around the time that the fruits start to form.

Preventive Measures 
Check your plants regularly for signs of leaf-footed bug activity, such as egg masses, discolored fruit, sunken areas on fruit, and damage to leaves and stems. You can use physical barriers, such as row covers or netting, to keep leaf-footed bugs away from your plants. Remove weeds from your fields because leaf-footed bugs can hide and feed on weeds. Keep your fields clean by removing fallen fruit or other debris that could attract leaf-footed bugs. Attract or introduce natural predators (birds, spiders, and predatory insects) that can help control leaf-footed bugs by providing shelter and water. Practice good field sanitation as the end of the season to reduce the chances of the insect to survive until the next season.
