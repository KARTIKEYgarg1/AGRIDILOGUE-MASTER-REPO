Pea Enation Mosaic Virus

Symptoms
The major symptom is the enation, which is evident on the lower side of the leaves. Downward curling of uppermost leaves occurs between 5-7 days after inoculation. This is followed by a marked vein clearing and the development of irregular chlorotic flecks and small irregular translucent lesions along the surface of the leaf. Pod size and quality are severely affected, leading to yield loss.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Use resistant varieties for planting. Place yellow sticky traps to control the aphid population. Plant tall border crops like maize, sorghum or millet to reduce the aphid population.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach along with preventive measures and available biological treatments. Monitor aphid population and apply approved pesticides at the correct timing.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by the mosaic virus (Luteoviridae) and is transmitted by aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum and Myzus ornatus) in a circulative non-propagative manner. Nymphs are more efficient than adults in transmitting the virus. The severity of the incidence depends on the age of the host plant and the environmental conditions.

Preventive Measures 
Check transplants for aphids before planting.
Control the aphid vector.
Remove and avoid alternative hosts, such as annual and perennial leguminous host and weed species that can serve as overwintering reservoirs for both PEMV and its aphid vector.
Manage vector populations.
