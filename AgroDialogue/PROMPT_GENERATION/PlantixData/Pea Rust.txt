Pea Rust
Pea Rust

Symptoms
Brown spore cushions appear on both sides of the leaves as well as on stalks. In dry weather conditions, these spore cushions spread out. Leaves become deformed and the whole plant has meagre growth. Nevertheless, the yield is little reduced.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
The damage is mostly detectable at a late state of the disease. Treatment is not necessary in most cases, since revenue losses are low.
Chemical Control
Fungicides based on Tebuconazole can be used

What caused it?
The fungus hibernates on field beans (also known as bell beans, broad beans or English beans), vetches and varieties of spurge. From there, it spreads to pea plants in spring. In winter, the fungus moves on to a new host.

Preventive Measures 
Remove all alternative hosts in the vicinity, such as Vicia species (broad bean) or Lathyrus (Vechtling).
