Product Recommendations
Organic Control
There are no biological methods known for controlling the disease successfully.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Applications with regulated products should be done as soon as the spots occur on the leaves.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by the fungus Phyllosticta cajanicola. This genus when fruiting on leaves is described as Phyllosticta while when occurring on other parts of the plant were taxonomically placed in Phoma. The fungus survives in infested crop residues and can be transmitted via seeds. Warm, humid conditions favor the development of the disease.

Preventive Measures 
Practice crop rotation and regular tillage to reduce the survival of the fungus.
