Organic Control
As it is a natural phenomenon biological control is not possible.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. As it is a natural phenomenon chemical control is not possible.

What caused it?
Frost damage occurs when ice forms inside the plant tissue and injures the plant cells, hence, it is the formation of ice rather than cold temperature that actually injures the plant. Cold winds remove moisture from evergreen foliage more than it is being replaces by the roots. This results in leaf browning especially at the tips and margins of the leaves. Young plants are more susceptible to frost damage than plants that have been fully established.

Preventive Measures 
Carefully select planting positions to avoid frost pockets.
Generally, low spots in local topography have colder temperatures and therefore more damage can be observed there.
Level the land to eliminate spots that accumulate cold air and to improve the drainage of cold air.
Leave dead leaves and branches on plants to help protect during the next freeze.
Prune off dead material when you see new growth emerging.
Cover plants with fleece or other suitable protection when there's a frost forecast.
