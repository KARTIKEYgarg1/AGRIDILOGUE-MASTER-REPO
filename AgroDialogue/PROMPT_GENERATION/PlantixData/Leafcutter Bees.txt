What caused it?
The symptoms are caused by solitary bees that belong to the Megachile family. These bees cut the leaves into pieces and transport them to their nests. The adult female builds nests using the cut leaves which are divided into cells and oviposits single egg into each cell. After moulting a few times, the larva spins a cocoon and pupates. It emerges from the nest as an adult. Males die shortly after mating, but females survive for another few weeks, during which they build new nests. They do not cause any economic damage.
