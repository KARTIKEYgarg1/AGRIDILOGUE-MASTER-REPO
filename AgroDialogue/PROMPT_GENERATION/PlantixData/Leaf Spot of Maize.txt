Leaf Spot of Maize

Symptoms
Initially, small dead spots with light-coloured halos, which can reach up to 0.5 cm in diameter appear on leaves. Severe infection may result in the yellowing of the whole leaf. Lesions and moulds appear on seeds, ultimately resulting in seedling blight and seed germination failure. Leaves show abnormal colours with necrotic areas. The seeds may exhibit discolourations, lesions on seeds, mould, and rot.

Organic Control
To this day, we are not aware of any biological control method available against this disease. If you know of any successful method to reduce the incidence or gravity of the symptoms, please contact us.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Use fungicides such as Mancozeb, Chlorothalonil, and Maneb.

What caused it?
The symptoms are caused by the fungi of C. lunatus. The infection can be caused by air bourne conidia and ascospores, rainwater splashing and irrigation, and can also survive in the soil via old crop residues. The disease is common in hot, humid areas, under an optimal temperature range of 24-30Â°C.

Preventive Measures 
Use available disease-free seeds and resistant varieties for planting.
Practice early harvest to reduce the amount of grain mould.
Remove and destroy crop residues after each season.
