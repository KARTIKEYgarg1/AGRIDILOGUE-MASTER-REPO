       "  'data': 'Long Smut of Sorghum\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThis disease is normally restricted to a relatively a small proportion of the florets, transformed into \"smut sori\", which are scattered on a head. The sori are elongated, more or less cylindrical, elongated, slightly curved fungal structures. They have a relatively thick creamy-brown covering membrane. Each sorus splits at the apex to release a black mass of spores and spread the disease further. About 8-10 dark brown filaments are found within this structure, representing the rests of the plant floral tissues.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTreatment of seeds with organic mercurial compounds is recommended to prevent disease outbreak.\\nChemical Control\\nNo chemical treatment seems to be available at the moment to treat this disease. Contact us in case you know of any.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Tolyposporium ehrenbergii. Its spores often stick together to form balls, which allow them to survive in the soil for many years. These spore balls can also adhere to the sorghum seeds and serve as the primary source of infection. The symptoms appear during the booting stage of sorghum, when resting spores germinate within the floral tissues and produce more spores. Those get carried through wind currents to flag leaves on other plants and washed down into the boots to initiate infection of individual spikelets. Airborne spores may also settle and germinate in water droplets accumulated at the flag leaf sheath and infect the opening florets in the panicle later during the season.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use only healthy seeds.\\nSeveral disease resistant or tolerant varieties are available, sow only these ones.\\nDiseased grains and plant material needs to be collected and destroyed immediately.\\nApply a crop rotation of 2-3 years to ensure dieback of spore balls in the soil.\\nSow early in the season to avoid exposure of young plants to airborne spores during T.\\nehrenbergii germination period.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Anthracnose\\n\\nSymptoms\\nType of crop, variety and environmental conditions will influence the severity of symptoms. Gray to tan-coloured lesions appear on leaves, stems, pods or fruits. These spots can be circular, oval or irregular in shape and with dark brown, reddish or purplish margins. Under favorable weather conditions, they become more numerous, enlarge and coalesce, turning dark brown or black in the process. Their center gradually becomes grayish and, in the later phases of the infection, it may show tiny dispersed black flecks. A reddish discoloration of the midrib of leaves is also common in some crops. In severe cases, the leaves wilt, dry and fall off, causing premature defoliation of the plant. On stems, lesions are elongated, sunken and brownish, also with darker margins. As they enlarge, the lesions may encircle the base of the stem, causing the plant to wilt and lodge. Top dieback of stems or branches is also common.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe spreading of the disease can be prevented by plunging seeds in a warm water bath before sowing (temperature and time depend on the crop). Neem oil can be sprayed. Biological agents might also help to control the infection. Products based on the fungus Trichoderma harzianum and the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis or B. myloliquefaciens can also be used as part of a seed treatment. Organically approved copper formulations can be sprayed against this disease in a variety of crops once the symptoms have been detected.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Also, treat seeds prior to planting. Seed dressing can be used to kill the fungi before sowing. Fungicides containing azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorothalonil, maneb or prothioconazole can be sprayed preventively to lower the risk of infection (please check the specific formulation and recommendations for your crop). Some cases of resistance to some of these products have been described. In some crops, no effective treatments is available. Finally, post-harvest treatments together with a food-grade wax can be applied to reduce the incidence on fruits bound to be shipped overseas.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by several species of fungi of the genus Colletotrichum spp. They survive in the soil, associated to seeds, or on plant debris and alternative hosts for up to four years. There are two ways by which the infection is carried over to new plants. Primary infections happen when soil- or seed-borne spores infect seedling during emergence, growing systemically in the tissues. On other cases, the spores are splashed onto the lower leaves by rain drops and start an infection that spread upward. Secondary infections start when the spores produced within the leaf or fruit lesions are dispersed by rain splashes, dew, sucking insects or field workers to upper plant parts or to other plants. Cool to warm temperatures (optimal 20 to 30 °C), soils with high pH, prolonged leaf wetness, frequent rainfalls and dense canopies favor the disease. A balanced fertilization makes crops less prone to anthracnose.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCultivate plants in well drained soils.\\nEnrich the soil with compost to help plant resist diseases.\\nIf possible, select sites with low rainfalls.\\nProvide the fields with good drainage.\\nUse seeds from healthy plants or from certified sources.\\nChoose a more resistant variety, if available in your area.\\nPlant resistant plants or buy healthy transplants.\\nKeep a wider space between plants at sowing.\\nMonitor fields or orchards for signs of the disease.\\nRemove volunteer plants and weeds in and around the field.\\nStake tall plants, such as tomatoes to improve improve air circulation around the leaves and stems.\\nPlant trap crops or trees around the fields.\\nPractice good sanitation of the field or orchard by removing plant debris for example.\\nAvoid the movement of machinery or workers in the fields when the foliage is wet.\\nClean your tools and equipment carefully.\\nTo avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools after use.(One part bleach to 4 parts water).\\nIf irrigation is necessary, plan it during the early morning and make sure the foliage is dry before nightfall.\\nWater plants with a drip sprinkler as opposed to an overhead sprinkler.\\nDo not touch the plants when they are wet.\\nHarvest early to avoid the worst symptoms.\\nStore fruits in a well-ventilated environment.\\nLeave plant debris on the ground instead as the fungus decomposes quicker there.\\nAlternatively, bury plant residues very deep in the soil to favor decomposition.\\nPlan a long-term crop rotation with non-host crops (3-4 years or more).'},\n",

Shortened internodes are also characteristic. At later stages of growth, the attack s is characterized on leaves by the appearance of red to brown spots along the veins. As the number of mite increases, these symptoms spread to the rest of the lamina, followed by chlorosis and necrosis of tissues. This leads to lower photosynthetic rates, which in turn results in delays in the ripening of berries or fruits, lower sugar contents and reductions in harvest. Early infestation may be particularly harmful, even if the population of mite remains low.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSome antagonistic species of mites can be used to control populations of Eotetranychus carpini, in particular the natural predator Kampimodromus aberrans. However, the latter is also killed by the same chemical treatments used to control the pest. Some species of minute pirate bugs or flower bugs (Anthocoridae) feed on the hornbeam mites and could be another way to control the infection.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Spraying two applications with acaricides could kill this pest, first at bud break and then when shoots are 10 cm long. These products will also affect the natural predators, Kampimodromus aberrans. Summer populations can be controlled by 2 treatments about 12 days apart.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the yellow vine mite Eotetranychus carpini, which infect important crops such as vines or peach trees. Females have an oblong body whose color vary from light to lemon yellow. They overwinter in groups under the bark of branches. When the first buds appear, they emerge and feed for about ten days on young leaves. The then start to lay spherical, translucent eggs with a fine stripe on the lower side of leaves. The nymphs are found in large clusters there, protected by a thin web. They feed along the veins on the sap produce by the leaves. Longevity of females (12 to 30 days) and number of generations (5 to 6) depend on temperature and state of the foliage. Optimal temperature for their growth is thought to be around 23° C.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the vineyard for signs of the disease, during bud emergence and the summer.\\nControl pesticide use so as not to affect beneficial enemies of the hornbeam mite.'},\n",

These pustules are to be found on both upper and lower side of leaves, stems and pods. At a later stage, secondary pustules seem to develop within the primary ones, forming an O shape with a dot in their center. The appearance and severity of the rust is greatly dependent on the prevailing weather condition. It develops rapidly on the plant when temperatures are above 20ºC and can literally cover it. A heavy infection will result in leaf drop, stunted plant growth and premature death.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological control agents are available to control this pathogen. Prophylactic spray of neem oil, jatropha oil or mustard oil results in less severity of the disease and better grain yield in comparison to control plot.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatmetns if available. Seed treatments with diclobutrazole have been used to reduce the transmission via seeds. Foliar application of fungicides just after the appearance of symptoms, followed by two more sprays at 10-day intervals reduces the incidence and severity of the disease. Flutriafol, metalaxyl could be recommended for the management of lentil rust. Other products include formulation that contain mancozeb, chlorothalonil and copper.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptom are caused by the fungus Uromyces viciae-fabae, which survives on plant debris, volunteer plants and weeds when no crops are available. It can also be carried on seeds as concomitant contaminations. It has a reduced number of hosts that, beside lentil, also includes broad bean and pea. When conditions are favorable (17 to 25°C and prolonged leaf wetness), it produces spores that are spread by the wind over large distance to infect new plants or fields. Other means of transmission are the transportation of plant debris between fields, contaminated hay, and the contamination of clothing, tools and machinery. It is regarded as a high economic threat because of its spreading capacity.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use healthy seeds from certified sources.\\nChoose resistant varieties if available.\\nPlan a crop rotation with a non-host crop.\\nKeep the fields clear of weeds and volunteer plants.\\nMonitor the fields for signs of the disease.\\nTake great care not to carry contaminated plant debris between fields or farms.\\nClean and disinfect tools and equipment after field work.\\nRemove and destroy infected plants by burning, grazing and burying them after harvest.\\nChange planting date to avoid worst symptoms.'},\n",

Some cereals develop yellow flecking or orange pinprick spots, and others a brown or reddish brown spotting. In some cases the spots enlarge and become water-soaked fingerprint-type blotches. These symptoms may be easily mistaken for spotting symptoms caused by fungi, such as tan spot, net blotch and Septoria leaf spot. However, if the cause is physiological, the spots are present on all leaves of the plant, whereas fungal diseases normally start in the lower canopy. Another main difference is that physiological lesions have sharp edges limited by the leaf veins (vs. diffuse with fungi).\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere is no biological control option available for physiological leaf spots at the moment. Please notify us, if you know of any.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. In cases where soil pH is neutral or low, the application of potash in the form of KCl has shown to correct or revert the symptoms in some varieties. Supplementing soil with potash is of limited utility in soils with high pH.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nPhysiological leaf spot is most frequently seen on winter wheat, but other cereals can also be affected. This disorder is thought to be caused by tissue oxidation due to environmental factors, for example sun damage to the upper leaves or a lack of chloride in soils. Other stresses, such as alternating cool, cloudy and wet weather followed by hot, sunny conditions, could be a trigger. The accumulation of pollen and water at the base of leaf sheaths may also cause the development of physiological spots. Physiological leaf spots may be easily mistaken for spotting symptoms caused by diseases, such as tan spot, net blotch and Septoria leaf spot. However, contrary to these pathologies, it is not thought to affect yield. It is thus extremely important to distinguish if spots are caused by disease or not before deciding whether to apply fungicides.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nSelect resilient varieties if available in the area.\\nRegularly monitor the crop and check for disease in a diagnostic laboratory.\\nAvoid soils with low chloride levels and monitor the soil regularly for this nutrient.\\nApply potash in the form of KCl as complement in the fertilization program (only if soils have optimal low pH).'},\n",

Active ingredients are mancozeb, conazole, or kitazin. Only spray fungicides with an actual registration for pomegranate. It is important to follow the specified concentrations and to use fungicides with different mode of actions to prevent resistances. To respect the waiting period is also very important.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora punicae. It can survive in plant debris and in infected stem portions of the plant. It is spread by wind borne spores. The disease emergence is favored by rainfall and water-saturated soil. So the infection process and the disease spread are fast during humid and rainy conditions. Leaf spots can reduce yield indirectly.

Fungicides containing chlorothalonil, captan or thiram can be used as spray applications on affected branches. Other fungicides, benzimidazoles and strobilurins can also be used, but are less effective. In moderately to severely infected orchards, fungicide applications are recommended at 10-14 days intervals, starting at the beginning of autumn and ending after leaf fall. The maximum number of applications during that period should not exceed six to seven. Note that none of the stated fungicides are able to control the disease completely.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nConstriction canker is a fungal disease caused by the fungus Phomopsis amygdali. It produces spores on structures that are sometimes visible as dark brown specks within the cankers. These spores are later released and spread by rain splashes and winds to other branches or trees, where they initiate new infections. Leaf wounds are the main entry point for the pathogen all year round, although scars on buds, fruits and blossoms can also play a role in the progression of the infection during the spring. The fungus then grow in the internal tissues, producing new cankers and eventually killing the shoots.

Predators of D. isocrates are lacewing, ladybird beetle, spider, red ant, dragonfly, robber fly, reduviid bug and praying mantis. Furthermore, species of wasps, big-eyed bug (Geocoris sp), earwig, ground beetle, pentatomid bug (Eocanthecona furcellata) are reportedly effective against the fruit borer. Bird species will also feed on the caterpillar. Calyx cup should be clipped off immediately after pollination as fruit borer lay eggs on calyx cup and this should be followed by applications of neem oil (3%) during the flowering stage. Set clean mud (heated by the sun) around the base of the fruit to protect it from the insect.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments. At flowering stage, spray Azadirachtin 1500ppm @3.0ml/lit of water at 15 days intervals commencing from initiation of flowering up to harvesting, subject to the presence of fruit borer. Spray one of the following chemicals: indoxacarb (1 g/l), cypermethrin (1.5 ml/l) or profenophos (2 ml/l) at a fortnightly interval from flowering to fruit development. Chemical applications of lambda-cyhalothrin are also recommended for effective control of pomegranate fruit borer. Two sprays of emamectin benzoate 5 SG at the rate of 0.25 g/l water or spinosad 45 SC at the rate of 0.20 ml/l water record the highest reduction in fruit damage.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage to Pomegranates is caused by larvae of Deudorix isocrates, which is commonly known as Anar Butterfly or Pomegranate Fruit Borer. It is the most destructive pest of the pomegranate fruit. The butterflies are active during the daytime and oviposit (laying eggs) singly on the fruits, tender leaves, flower buds and stalks. A female lays 20.5 eggs with an average of 6.35 eggs under controlled conditions. D. isocrates takes about 33 - 39 days to complete a life cycle from oviposition to adult emergence. After hatching, the larvae bore itself into the growing fruits, and feed on the pulp, developing seeds and tissues. Feeding damage is most likely to occur between 30 to 50 days of age. The incidence of pomegranate butterfly is most severe during July and shows a significant positive correlation with relative humidity. The incidence is less in March and steadily increases till it reaches its peak in September.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor your field regularly looking for dry branches.\\nEstablishing light traps @ 1/acre to monitor the adult butterflies.\\nCollect the damaged fruits and destroy them away from the field.\\nClipping off calyx cup of flowers immediately after pollination will help to reduce the egg load on the fruits and the damage level.\\nRemove weeds and plants that serve as alternate hosts.\\nBag the fruits from an early age (when they are ca.\\n5 cm big) with butter paper, coarse cloth or muslin cloth of 300 gauge thickness to create a barrier to the borer.\\nDig or plough around pomegranate tree immediately after harvest to expose the pupae to predatory birds, other natural enemies and the sun.'},\n",

Under conditions of high relative humidity, the honeydew is of low viscosity and the surface white. The surfaces of the panicle, seed, leaves, stalk and soil also become smeared by the dripping honeydew and appear whitish. A white, powdery crust forms wherever such honeydew dries. The honeydew may be colonized by several types of opportunistic fungi.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSome commercial products containing specific fungal isolates, including those of Trichoderma species, could reduce or prevent disease in glasshouse trials, particularly several days before fungus inoculation.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

These fungicides as well as azoxystrobin can also be applied directly on the stigma with satisfying effect.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Claviceps africana. Infected sorghum flowers exude honeydew with a high concentration of primary spores. Additionally, windborne spores are produced that are spread over moderate to large distances. The primary infection starts with mature seedborne spores or infected panicles fallen on the ground during the harvest and/or honeydew remnants sticking to the seed.

The pathogen can affect yields in a matter of days, leaving farmers no time to act. Head infections during the flowering stage result in no grain production. However, infection at the grain filling stage results in small, shriveled and discolored grains. Two types of lesions are visible on older leaves: in mild cases, black specks and large eye-shaped lesions with light gray centers and darker margins. Severely infected leaves, in turn, are characterized by the presence of black specks and small brown spots with black margin and sometimes a chlorotic halo. Symptoms on the ear closely resemble and could easily be mistaken for Fusarium head blight.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo date, there is no evidence of biological control of M. oryzae in the field. However, in rice, seed treatment and foliar spray with formulations of Pseudomonas fluorescens effectively controls blast disease and increases the grain yield.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Elevated precipitation of prolonged exposition to dew during the flowering or grain filling stages is a strong driver of wheat blast. Check weather forecast for rain/ dew before the application of systemic fungicides as a preventive measure. Regardless, fungicides typically provide only a partial defense. Apply solutions containing active ingredients trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole before rain or dew at flowering stage. Do not use chemicals with the same mode of action each year as this can lead to resistance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungi Magnaporthe oryzae, which can survive on seeds and crop residues. Besides wheat, this species has diversified and adapted to infect important crops such as barley and rice as well as a number of other plants. This makes crop rotation rather ineffective to control it. Most wheat varieties currently grown are susceptible to this disease. During ear emergence and grain filling stages, warm temperatures and (18-30°C) relative humidity above 80% can result in severe damage and sometimes the devastation of the crop within a week.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCheck for quarantine regulations in your area/country.\\nEducate growers and extension workers to recognize the disease symptoms.\\nUse seeds from a certified source or make sure that seeds are free from fungal contamination.\\nChose resistant or resilient varieties (several available on the market).\\nRemove plant residues and alternative hosts from the field.\\nAvoid excessive nitrogen fertilization.\\nApply silica amendments to increase host resistance.\\nAdjust the sowing time to avoid rain during the flowering or grain filling stages.'},\n",

Initially, water-soaked spots with an irregular shape appear on fruits, leaves, or petioles. As they enlarge, the affected areas become covered by a white, profuse cottony mold, at later stages scattered with visible grayish or black wart-like reproductive structures called sclerotia. \"Dry\" lesions may develop on at the base of stems and branches, clearly delimited from the healthy tissues. During later stages, the fungus encircles the stem and the upper parts of the plant tend to wilt, turn brown and die. Hardened fungal growth form inside the stem and replace the plant tissues. This may result in death and consequent lodging of plants. Infected pods and seeds may shrivel or may be replaced by black fungal growth.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nGranular formulations of spores of the fungal parasite Coniothyrium minitans or species of Trichoderma have been applied to soils to reduce the fungal load of Sclerotinia and hinder the development of the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatment if available. Foliar fungicide applications are only recommended in fields with severe disease development. Treatments will vary depending on the crop in question and the developmental stage. Control of Sclerotinia diseases of cabbage, tomato and beans is difficult. However, fungicides based on iprodione or copper oxychloride (3 g/l of water) provide effective control on lettuce and peanuts. The development of resistance has been described for some of these compounds.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the soil-borne fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, which can survive for long periods of time on plant debris or in the soil. Most of its life cycle takes place in the soil. This explains why the symptoms begin in leaves and plant parts in contact or near the ground. When conditions are favorable, it resumes growth on organic matter and occasionally by invading plant tissues. As they colonize all plant parts, seeds may also carry the pathogen, either on the seed coat or internally. The new batch of spores produced on the plant are airborne. The humid microclimate under the canopy favors the spreading of spores onto the stems. Initial development requires several hours of leaf wetness and temperatures from 15 to 24°C. The presence of external nutrients also favors its growth.

Feeding can also be observed on the apical buds and on fruits in the form of feeding holes or galleries that extend down to the bone.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe removal of suckers in older olive orchards is the best way to prevent the rapid build-up of jasmine moth populations. Parasitoids wasps of the species Trichogramma and Apanteles and the predators Anthocoris nemoralis and Chrysoperla carnea are important enemies of the jasmine moth. The use of solutions based on Bacillus thuringiensis is also recommended against P. unionalis.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

The fungus can survive in two ways. One, it survives in diseased rhizomes kept for seeds, and secondly, by resting structures like chlamydospores and oospores that reach the soil from infected rhizomes. Younger sprouts are the most susceptible to the pathogen and the disease is aggravated by nematode infestation.

First signs of infestation may be the appearance of numerous white scale armors (about 2 mm in diameter) on stems, leaves and fruits of the host. As they feed, they produce honeydew that drops onto fruits and leaves and favors the development of sooty molds. At heavy infestations, leaves may show signs of wilting and fall prematurely. Shoots may dry and fruits show deformation, something that is particularly serious in the case of table olives. Overall, the tree show poor vigor and yields and quality can be affected.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNatural enemies of A. nerii include the parasitoid wasp Aphytus melinus and Aphytis chilensis and the coccinellid predators Chilocorus bipustulatus, Rhyzobius lophantae and Chilocorus kuwanae. The latter is most successful in controlling scales in sunny locations with large scale infestations. Organic pesticides with short persistence based on plant oils, plant extracts, fatty acids or pyrethrins could also be used. Frequent application may be needed and the underside of leaves should be targeted.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological control, if available. Contact sprays containing the active ingredients deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin or cypermethrin can give some control if applied thoroughly to the underside of leaves. The systemic insecticide acetamiprid is absorbed into plant tissues and taken in by the scales as they feed. Note that dead scales can remain firmly attached to the leaves or stems.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the oleander scale, Aspidiotus nerii. Adults are flat and oval, about 2 mm in length and have a whitish, waxy covering that repels liquids. The immature stages (crawlers) are much smaller. Both are found encrusted on the lower side of leaves and on stems, sucking out plant sap. The dispersal of the scales over large distances is predominantly through infected plant material. Locally, the crawlers are very active and mobile, migrating from tree to tree when those are in contact through adjacent branches. Temperature and humidity have an important effect on their life cycle. At 30 °C the development of crawlers is completely hindered. A. nerii is usually considered a minor pest on olive orchards.

At the base of the plant these cankers may encircle the stem and hinder the transport of water and nutrients, eventually killing the plant. Brown, soft, sunken lesions appear on fruits. As they enlarge, they often merge, covering a large portion of the fruit surface and creating concentric rings of small black dots on their margins. Eventually, fruits rot.

The fungus survives in crop debris and its spores are spread by wind and rain onto healthy plants. It is also thought to be carried in and on seeds. This makes the acquisition of certified seeds and healthy seedlings important in the fight against this disease. Penetration of leaf tissues can take place within 6-12 hours, and hot and relatively humid conditions are required for infection and disease development (27-35° C).

       "  'data': 'Mango Fruit Fly\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms for C. cosyra infection are exclusively visible on the fruits. The females inject their eggs predominantly into matured mangos. The affected fruits exhibit a gummy consistence due to the internal feeding and the digesting process of the larvae. The exit holes of the larvae are visible on the surface of the fruit. Inner decomposition results in brown and sometimes black lesions on the peel. The peel may also be scabbed or pitted. The fruits may discolor and show stains of mold as they progressively decay. They subsequently feature a foul odor and may secrete a mixture of fungal and fruit ooze.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTraps containing protein baits can be effective for the monitoring and catching of C. cosyra populations. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae parasitizes the pupae of C. cosyra on the ground and can be dispersed by hand or as oil-based spray. Post-harvest hot water treatment of the fruits at temperatures above 46 degrees or prolonged storage at 7.5 degrees or below also destroy the larvae.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Traps containing an insecticide (e.g. deltamethrin) combined with a specific bait (protein hydrolysate or protein autolysate) are recommended. This method ensures punctual treatment of the flies, attracting all surrounding individuals. Males of C. cosyra can be attracted and trapped with terpineol acetate or methyl eugenol.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the larvae of the fruit fly Ceratitis cosyra. Adults have a yellowish body with black spots scattered on the thorax. Their wings are yellow and may reach a span of 4-6 mm. Females implant eggs into the ripening mango fruits and continue to do so for about two weeks. After 2-3 days, the larvae hatch and start digging tunnels through the mango flesh. Fruits may be infested with up to 50 larva each and can sometimes start to show symptoms only after harvest. To pupate, the larvae let themselves fall onto the ground and dig into the upper layers of the soil. After 9 to 12 days the fully grown flies hatch.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant early-maturing varieties to make sure the fruits ripen when fly populations are low.\\nPick infested or dropped fruits every day.\\nInstall protein bait traps to monitor possible fly invasions.\\nDo not grow alternative host plants such as citrus, guava, papaya, melons, etc nearby.\\nWeed and till carefully around the trees to detect fallen fruits under residues.\\nPreferably grow mango varieties with similar growth cycles.\\nTransport and sell unaffected mangos only.\\nEnsure immediate consumption or proper destruction of unsold fruit.\\nTilling around the trees kills the ground-developing pupae.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Bacterial Spot and Speck of Tomato\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms can be seen on the foliage, stems, and fruits of tomatoes. Initially small yellow-green lesions appear on young leaves for bacterial spot, whilst bacterial speck causes black spots with a narrow yellow halo. They are usually more numerous on leaf margins or tips, which may appear deformed and twisted. In severe cases, the spots of bacterial speck may coalesce or overlap, resulting in larger and irregular lesions. Bacterial spot lesions can enlarge from 0.25 cm to 0.5 cm and become tan to brownish-red, which will eventually look like shot holes when the center dries up. Bacterial spot produces similar lesion of fruits as it does on the leaves and eventually roughen, becoming brown and scabbed. Bacterial speck causes tiny, slightly raised black specks. It is difficult to distinguish between these two diseases at an early stage.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBacterial Spot is very difficult to control and also expensive to treat. If the disease occurs early in the season, consider destroying the entire crop. Copper-containing bactericides provide a protective cover on foliage and fruit for both bacteria. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) that specifically kill the bacteria are available for the bacterial spot. Submerging seeds for one minute in sodium hypochlorite or in hot water (50°C) for 25 minutes can reduce the incidence of both diseases.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Copper-containing bactericides can be used as a protectant and give partial disease control. Application at first sign of disease and then at 10 to 14-day intervals when warm (spot) / cold (speck), moist conditions prevail. As the development of resistance to copper is frequent, a combination of copper-based bactericide with mancozeb is also recommended.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBacterial Spot and Speck are caused by several species of bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. Bacterial spot occurs worldwide and is one of the most devastating diseases on tomatoes grown in warm, moist environments. The pathogens can survive in or on seeds, plant debris, and specific weeds. Xanthomonas has a limited survival period of days to weeks in the soil. Secondary infection can occur through rain or overhead irrigation. It enters the plant tissues through leaf pores and wounds. Optimal temperatures range from 25 to 30°C for the bacterial spot. Once the crop is infected, the disease is very difficult to control and can lead to total crop losses. Bacterial speck outbreaks are relatively infrequent and are favored by prolonged leaf moisture and cool temperatures.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant disease-free seeds if possible from a certified source.\\nUse resistant varieties if available locally.\\nInspect field regularly, particularly during overcast weather.\\nAvoid injuring transplants during handling or planting.\\nEnsure sufficient space between plants and use stakes to keep them upright.\\nRemove and burn any seedling or plant part with leaf spots.\\nRemove weeds in and around the field.\\nMulch the soil to avoid soil-to-plant contamination.\\nClean tools and equipment.\\nAvoid overhead irrigation and working in fields when foliage is wet.\\nPlough deep plant debris after harvest.\\nAlternatively, remove plant debris and leave the soil idle for some weeks or a month (solarization).\\nPlan a 2-3 year crop rotation with a non-susceptible crop.'},\n",

Seed treatments with warm water (45°C) for 2h before sowing eliminates the spores.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Contact and systemic fungicides (moving into and inside of the developing seedling) like tebuconazole, benzimidazoles, phenylpyrroles and triazoles are effective in protecting the seeds from T. caries.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Tilletia caries, that persists as dormant spores on seeds and in the soil for up to two years. In areas where spores survive in the soil, most infections originate from the very early stages of plant growth, just after germination. The fungus can also infect young wheat shoots just before they emerge from the soil via infectious hairs. They then gradually colonize the internal tissues of the plant as it grows, eventually reaching the inflorescences and grains. Some of the smutted wheat kernels break open during harvest and release new spores that are blown away by air currents onto the soil to start a new cycle. The rest of the seeds get harvested and can act as vectors for future infections. Optimum conditions for spore germination are soil temperatures in the range of 5-15 °C.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlanting winter wheat early when the soil temperature is above 20°C results in almost no infection.\\nAlso, plant summer wheat as late as possible.\\nUse resistant varieties and check the seeds for proper certification.\\nRotate crops accordingly.\\nUse sterile agricultural tools when working between different fields.'},\n",

Adult midges have a mosquito-like appearance, with a bright orange body, transparent wings and very long antennae. When the temperatures and humidity rise, they come out of their diapause in the grain and mate within an hour. Shortly after that, the females lay 1 to 5 small, cylindrical and transparent eggs in each spikelet. The eggs hatch within 2 to 3 days and the young, colorless larvae begin to feed on the soft tissue of the developing grain. After 10-15 days of continuous feeding, the mature dark-orange larvae pupate inside the grain for 3 to 5 days before emerging as an adult and start the cycle over again.

       "  'data': 'Magnesium Deficiency\\n\\nSymptoms\\nMagnesium-deficient plants generally develop a mottled pale green or chlorotic pattern in the interveinal tissue of older leaves, often starting near the margin. In cereal, leaves with mild deficiencies develop a green linear beading that progresses to interveinal chlorosis. In severe cases, the yellowing progresses to the middle of the leaf and the small veins also become affected. Reddish or brown spots appear on the leaf blade. Later on, the development of necrotic areas in the highly chlorotic tissue gives the leaves a rugged and deformed aspect. Finally, the yellowing engulfs the whole leaf, eventually leading to premature death and early shedding. Root growth is inhibited, resulting in poor plant vigor.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nApply substances that contain magnesium such as algal limestone, dolomite or limestone magnesium. Use manure, organic mulches or compost to balance the soil nutrient content. They contain organic matter and many nutrients that are released slowly into the soil.\\nChemical Control\\nUse fertilizers containing magnesium (Mg).\\nExamples: magnesium oxide, magnesium sulphate (MgSO4).\\nConsult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.\\nFurther recommendations:\\nIt is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.\\nMagnesium can be applied directly to the soil or with foliar sprays.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nMagnesium deficiency is a common problem in light, sandy, or acidic soils with low nutrient and water retention capacity. In those soils, nutrients can be easily leached away. Soils rich in potassium or ammonium or the excess application of these nutrients can also be problematic because they compete with magnesium in the soil. Magnesium is involved in sugar transport and is an important part of the chlorophyll molecules. Without sufficient amounts of magnesium, the plants begin to degrade the chlorophyll in the older leaves to transfer it to the newer developing ones. This explains the development of interveinal chlorosis. Light intensity influences the development of the symptoms. High light worsens the effects of a deficiency.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCheck the pH of the soil and lime if necessary to get the optimal range.\\nPlan a good drainage of fields and do not overwater the crop.\\nDo not over fertilize with potash.\\nUse organic mulch to keep soil moisture stable.'},\n",

The most common symptom is the formation of even or broken yellow streaks that run from the leaf midrib to the margin. These streaks later turn brown or black and can be interrupted by yellow blotches or eye-shaped patterns. Necrosis starts to appear on the leaf, starting from the margin, and sometimes affecting midrib and petiole. Occasionally, the internal tissues of the stem are also affected by decay. The latter symptom is particularly visible under low temperature and short-day conditions. Not all leaves are affected but plant growth is usually stunted, while the size of the bunches and fruits is reduced.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBio-control agents such as parasitoid wasps, lacewings or hover flies and lady birds can be used to control populations of mealybugs. Light mineral oils or neem extracts sprayed on leaves are also effective when populations are small.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. There is no chemical treatment of viral diseases. The waxy protective coating of mealybugs makes them difficult to kill. Treatments with insecticides such as deltamethrin can be used to control mealybug populations.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused by a complex of viruses. The nature of the symptoms is determined by the concentration of viral particles in plants. Temperatures, and weather patters in general, also influence the outcome of an infection. The virus is spread from tree to tree or between fields through several species of mealybugs (Pseudococcidae). Another means of long distance dissemination is the use of infected planting material or seeds. It is not soil-borne and unlikely to be transmitted via mechanical injuries to plants through during field work. It is a worldwide problem that affect banana and related species and that can adversely affect plant growth, fruit yield and quality.

The galleries in trunks or branches also disrupt the normal circulation of sap, hindering water and nutrient from reaching branches above. Adults are dark-brown, about 2.5-3.5 mm in length and with dark wing covers punctuated with stiff hairs. The larva is mostly white with a brown head. It is a profiteering insect that mainly attacks weakened trees and thus desiccated broken branches. During the cold season, as long as the temperature is below +5°C the bark beetles stop feeding. In the right conditions, it can be very harmful to pistachio trees.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo control bark beetles, it is important to have vigorous, healthy trees and to make sure to apply a series of preventive measures together with neighboring farms. Some parasitoids wasps attack this beetle, as do several predatory beetles and mites. Their overall controlling effects has been estimated to be around 10% of the pest population.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an approach that combines preventative measures with biological treatments if available. This pest is inaccessible to a simple chemical control even combined with mineral oils that facilitate the penetration of insecticides. Therefore, preventive measures are essential to avoid its spread. They should be applied by all growers in a region so that the insects cannot migrate from affected orchards to healthy ones. The bark beetle attacks mainly weakened trees, so it is necessary to keep the trees healthy (fertilization, irrigation, pruning, pest and disease control).\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the beetle Chaetoptelius vestitus, a member of the Scolytidae family. Adults emerge in April-May when temperatures rise above 25 °C. Females fly to young twigs of healthy trees to bore short tunnels into the terminal or floral buds, thereby destroying them. They later also start to feed on young shoots and twigs, which wither very quickly as the consequence of the damage. During summer and winter the beetles hibernate within the pistachio twigs. At the end of the winter, females look for weakened or broken branches wherein they excavate reproductive galleries and lay approximately 80-85 eggs.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nIrrigate according to schedule, especially during dry periods, to avoid stress.\\nPrune and burn dry and weak branches that could be infested with the pest.\\nMaintain orchards clear of weeds and dead branches.\\nInspect the pruning wood for the presence of the bark beetle, its larvae, or simply their galleries.\\nWood traps can also be placed throughout the plot to attract adults to weak, parched branches and then pick them up and burn them.'},\n",

High temperatures and low rainfall are ideal for the development of large populations in the field. Optimal conditions are temperatures between 25.5 °C and 27.5 °C and humidities between 80 and 90%. Intensive, continuous rice culture and the sharing of equipment between fields is also conducive to population buildup. Rice plants can be infested throughout the entire year.

Females lay eggs singly, or more rarely in pairs, on the stems or on the soil near the base of the seedlings (the 3-4-leaf stage is preferred). The application of farmyard manure to the soil seems to attract more female flies and increase ovoposition. Newly emerged larvae are cylindrical and white.

Finally, during olive flowering and fruit set, the waxy secretion of the nymphs causes the premature drop of flowers and small fruits. Large populations may retard the growth of young trees and cause significant yield reductions. Trees that are heavily infested can have yield losses of 30 to 60%.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPredatory insects e.g. the parasitic wasp Psyllaephagus euphyllurae, the pirate bug Anthocoris nemoralis, the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea and the lady beetle Coccinella septempunctata reduce the populations of olive psyllid. Generally, make sure not to eradicate these species by using broad-scale insecticides. Nonresidual, organic contact insecticides that work against psyllids are insecticidal soaps based on neem oil and horticultural oil. These should be applied before the insects secrete their protective wax.

Insecticidal formulations containing either 0,02 % cypermethrin, 0,02 % decamethrin can be applied at fortnightly intervals.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of the moth Hedylepta indicata. Adults are pale brown with a wingspan of about 20 mm. They have golden or yellow brown forewings with three dark zigzagging lines and some darker patches. On hindwings, the number of crossing lines is reduced to two. Female moths lay eggs singly on the young leaves or shoot of host plants. The caterpillars are pale green with a pale brown head. They live and feed between folded leaves weaved together with silk. Pupation takes place in a cocoon amongst litter on the soil surface. The bean leaf webber has a wide host range including plants of the legume family, red beet, and maize. It is not considered to be an important pest and may thus not need treatment.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resistant varieties.\\nMonitor your plants carefully and if a critical number of plants shows symptoms, implement disease management measures.\\nPerform crop rotation.\\nRemove weeds from the cultivation site.\\nSow nectar-producing plants around the fields to support natural predators.\\nPheromone traps can be used to determine numbers and disrupt mating behaviors.'},\n",

Mature larvae feed on the whole leaves, starting from the edges and moving towards the veins, leaving only the midrib and veins (a process called skeletonization). Later on, they also feed on young shoots, buds and bolls. Black excrements on the leaf surface are a common sign of the presence of the pest. Outbreaks may happen sporadically, depending mainly on weather conditions, and can cause yield loss if severe. Semiloopers are only a significant threat to the crops if occurring in high numbers and attacking young plants. As they grow older, plants get more and more resistant to this pest.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSemilooper management is based on regular scouting for eggs or small larvae. Some species of the parasitoid wasps of the family Ichneumonidae, Braconidae, Scelionidae, Trichogrammatidae and Tachinidae can be used as biological control method. You can also use neem oil sprays to control population peaks. For example, neem seed kernel extracts (NSKE 5%) or Neem oil (1500ppm) @ 5ml/l can be sprayed.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of preventive measures together with biological treatment if available. Extensive insecticide use can lead to resistance in the pest. As larvae become increasingly resilient to insecticidal treatment while growing, scouting for eggs and young larvae is crucial. Treatment is recommended during the egg stage. Insecticides containing chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, flubendiamide, or esfenvalerate can be applied. Chemical treatment may be inviable in low-value crops.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the larvae of Anomis flava, a moth that can be found in most parts of the world. Adult moths have orange brownish forewings traversed by two grey zigzagging lines near the edge. A conspicuous orange, triangular mark covers up to half of the top part of the wing, closest to the body. Hindwings are light brown, with no special features. Females lay approximately 500-600 round eggs on leaves. Young larvae are of a pale green color and with thin yellowish lines clearly separating the first five segments. Older larvae turn brownish or black and develop two dorsal yellowish lines. The pupae are of a brownish color and can be found on folded leaves. The English name semilooper refers to the way larvae move forward, forming an arch with their body.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant tolerant varieties, if available in your market.\\nPlan a good drainage of the field, as heavy rainfall increases the chance of an infestation.\\nSow early to avoid population peaks (usually between 60 and 75 days after sowing).\\nMonitor fields and remove infected leaves by hand.\\nControl insecticide use as this can affect beneficial insects.\\nApply a crop rotation with non-susceptible crops .'},\n",

Commonly used post-infection fungicides include fosetyl-aluminum, azoxystrobin and phenylamides (ex. metalaxyl-M).\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by fungi of the group of the Peronosporales and can be very destructive in shaded areas with frequent rainfalls and warm temperatures (15-23°C). These fungi have adapted pretty well to their hosts, meaning that each major crops harbor its own species of fungus. The fungus overwinters in infected plant debris or shoots, in the soil or on alternative hosts (crops and weeds). Wind and rain spread the spores during favorable conditions.

Unripe fruits that are still attached to the plant for up to one week past the scheduled harvest are not susceptible. Harvested fruits may also hold for 1 to 4 days depending on the variety. In ripe fruit, damage usually consists of breakdown of tissues and internal rotting associated with maggot infestation. Following oviposition there may also be some necrosis around the puncture marks ('sting'). The mechanical damage to fruits (or by other means) compromises the integrity of the skin and may favor the oviposition into the fruit flesh.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSterile males of Bactrocera dorsalis have been used in Japan to eradicate the fly from plantations, combined with traps. Use bait sprays with a suitable organically accepted insecticide (e.g. spinosad) mixed with a protein bait. Install pheromone traps to monitor fly number.

If pheromone trap catches exceeds 8 per day for 3 consecutive days or if 10% rosette flowers or 10% damaged green bolls are observed in the crop, then follow the control measures below: Use baits with a suitable insecticide mixed with a protein solution. The most widely protein used is the hydrolysed form, but some of these are highly phytotoxic. Light-activated xanthene dye is an effective alternative. The males of B. dorsalis are attracted to methyl eugenol (4-allyl-1,2-dimethoxybenzene), sometimes in very large numbers.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis. The color of the fly is very variable, but there are predominantly yellow and dark brown complemented with black markings on the thorax. The development from egg to adult under summer conditions requires about 16 days but this period may be extended considerably by cool weather. Females can lay from 1,200 to 1,500 eggs into ripe fruits during her lifetime, causing considerable damage if left unchecked. After feeding on the banana flesh, the mature larva emerges from the fruit, drops to the ground, and forms a tan to dark brown pupa.

Besides trunks and crowns (thereby the common name of the disease), these swellings may also develop around graft unions or on roots. Initially, small, callus-like outgrowths appear during early summer, when temperatures are at or above 20°C. These callus develop rapidly and produce soft, spongy, more-or-less spherical galls that can reach sizable dimensions. As they mature, they become dessicate and necrotic, turning darker in color. Once the gall start to grow, they may girdle the vine or the branch of the affected tree and disrupt the flow of water and nutrients. This restricts growth and can lead to dieback of young vines or trees.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe antagonist bacteria Agrobacterium radiobacter variety K-84 has been used to control crown gall in a number of crops in an effective way. Unfortunately, this method does not work on grapes. An alternative method using the variety F2/5 of the bacterium A. vitis has shown promising results but is not available commercially yet.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Currently available chemical treatments against crown gall (bactericides, antibiotics) are not effective, as they only treat the symptoms and do not eliminate the bacterial infection. The control of the disease focuses on prevention of injuries to the vines and the cultivation site.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nCrown gall is a disease that affects grapevine and a long series of economically important tree hosts, among other peach trees. It is caused by the bacteria Agrobacterium vitis, which can survive for several years in dead plant debris on the ground or buried in the soil. These can then become a source of inoculum causing new wood to become infected. Any wound site is a potential entry point for the pathogen and could result in the formation of galls. These can be injuries caused by adverse weather conditions (freezing, hail), mechanical friction of roots or injuries during field work (pruning, graft unions, removal of suckers). The bacteria can grown in living wood and plant tissues for years without causing symptoms. Thus, the transmission of the disease between areas may happen through the transport of apparently healthy cuttings. It is crucial to select an appropriate site to avoid the worst effects of the disease. For example, in areas where freezing injury during winter is common, the incidence of crown gall could be higher.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChose healthy planting material from certified sources.\\nPlant varieties that are more resistant to freezing injuries.\\nSite selection is critical to avoid the disease, particularly in regions where freezing temperatures can be reached.\\nPlant vines in sites with no previous history of crown gall.\\nMaximize air ventilation through a proper pruning for example.\\nAllow also a good drainage of the field.\\nAvoid damage to plants during field work.\\nDo not transport suspected planting material to other vineyards.'},\n",

When disease pressure is high, summer-long fungicide applications will be required, particularly in wet summers. In late-maturing varieties an extra application early in fall will also prevent the disease from infecting the fruits.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Diplocarpon maculatum, which survives the winter in lesions on green twigs and fallen leaves. Often the primary infections do not occur until early summer to mid summer. The spores are produced on fallen, overwintered leaves or on shoots from the previous season. Secondary infections begin about 1 month later and reoccur throughout the season during periods of rain.

Severely infected leaves dry, turn brown and fall off rapidly. The premature shedding of leaves can affect adversely flower development and fruit quality in the next seasons. Moreover, if it persists on the same tree year after year, it can weaken the tree vigor. Fruits can be blemished and could thus be unmarketable.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nUsually, treatments are not necessary since the fungus appears irregularly, does not weaken the tree and does not directly affect the fruits.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Fungicide sprays should be started immediately after the first symptoms of infection appear. Application of products based on myclobutanil, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, mancozeb, trifloxystrobin or difenoconazole can help to control the disease. In case of a late infection, the treatment should be applied directly after the harvest, if possible.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the fungus Tranzschelia pruni-spinosae, which is an obligate parasite, meaning that it needs living tissues to complete its life cycle. The fungus may overwinter as spores lodged in crevices on bark of branches or in bud scales. Alternatively, it switches hosts in late summer and survives on species of the genus Anemone when the plum trees are dormant. The spots on the underside of leaves contain spore-producing structures that yield two types of spores: one that infect stone fruits during late-spring and summer or one that is exclusively infecting the alternative hosts late in the season. On both cases, the spores germinate readily in the presence of moisture on leaves (dew or rain). Low altitude, humid locations and susceptible varieties facilitate the occurrence of the fungus. Disease was observed in most parts of the world. It spreads rapidly and can assume epidemic proportions if the weather conditions are favorable for its growth.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChose resistant varieties if available.\\nEnsure a pruning method that allow for a good ventilation of the foliage.\\nAvoid excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers.\\nEnsure that no alternative hosts are present in and around the fields.\\nRemove contaminated leaf litter from the leaf and burn it.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Angular Leaf Spot of Strawberry\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms vary depending on the plant variety, weather conditions, and time of year. Initially, they are characterized by water-soaked, dark green angular spots on the lower surface of leaves. When hold against sunlight, these spots appear translucent and framed by the leaf small veins. When moisture is high, sticky droplets of bacterial ooze are secreted from these lesions. As the disease progresses, the lesions eventually become visible as irregular, brown or reddish spots on the upper leaf surface. They later coalesce and form large patches of necrotic tissue, giving leaves a ragged or scorched appearance. The fruit stalks may turn brownish-black and the fruits can wither since the water supply is cut off. This affects the fruit quality and appearance. Fruits will not contain much sugar, but the consistency is usually quite regular.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSpraying certified organic copper compounds can help to reduce the disease. Application of solutions containing citric and lactic acid may also help to protect developing leaves and berries from infection early in the season.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Products based on copper can be applied at low temperatures to reduce the infection from plant to plant via the bacterial ooze. However, the frequency and dosage need to be carefully planned, so that plants are not damaged. Do not use copper agents under dry conditions and after the initiation of bloom. Copper hydroxide formulations may be more effective than copper sulfate formulations. Oxolinic acid application showed good results in the nursery period. Validamycin-A is an effective compound in the cultivation stage.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas fragariae, which can overwinter on dry leaf debris on the ground or buried leaves in the soil. It is extremely resistant to adverse conditions such as dessication. In spring, the pathogen resumes growth and contaminate new healthy plants, carried from plant to plant by splashing water from rain or overhead irrigation. The ooze secreted under the leaf surface is the secondary source of inoculum. In both cases, the bacteria enter the plant via its natural pores or via wounds inflicted during field operations. Alternatively, infected transplants can bring the disease to a new field.

At the early stages, they are characterized by the development of small circular spots, reddish to purple in color and particularly conspicuous when moist. As they enlarge they become slightly elongated and sunken, and orange to brown in color. As the bark deteriorates, cracks develop on the margins and start to curl upwards. Creamy white fungal growth can be observed in their center. The canker can girdle the young twigs and kill them. Young leaves or fruits can also be affected and develop brown spots and patches, that in the case of fruits cause \"bull\\'s eye rot\" during storage. In particularly susceptible varieties, it can lead to defoliation of the tree and reduced vigor. This in turn leads to a reduction of fruit quality.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe application of a Bordeaux mixture or copper sulphate after harvest can reduce the incidence of anthracnose the following season. These compounds can also be used before the harvest to control the formation of bull\\'s-eye rot on fruits.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. There are no fungicides that have been proven fully effective at eradicating existing cankers. However, preventive fungicide applications before the harvest may reduce the incidence of bull\\'s-eye rot on fruits during storage. Same application after harvest many reduce cankers the following season. Products based on captan, mancozeb or ziram can be used for these purposes.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are mainly caused by a fungus called Neofabra malicorticis, but other fungi from the same family can be involved. They can survive on infected plant debris or in the soil. It thrives under moist and warm conditions, with frequent rainfalls. During the spring, it resumes growth and start to produce spores. These spores are then easily spread via irrigation water or rain splashes to other trees or plants. They can enter the trees through small injuries but can also penetrate uninjured bark.

Bud development is delayed or stopped, with the internal tissues undergoing necrosis. Graft failure is also characteristic of this disease. These symptoms do not always occur together and in some varieties, there are no foliar symptoms at all. Overall, the disease decreases the cultivars' productivity and longevity, reduces yields and increases production costs.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nA certain degree of biocontrol can be reached through the use of formulations of species of Trichoderma fungi (for example a mixture of T. sperellum and T. gamsii). This helps to protect pruning wounds, basal ends of propagation material and grafts before infection.

They infect a wide range of hosts but are most commonly associated with woody plants. The fungi overwinters on the bark of infected vines or trees and start producing spores during the spring. Spores are spread via wind and rain splashes to other vines. They enter the tissues through fresh injuries such as natural cracks, pruning wounds or cuts where they can germinate at temperatures above 5 °C. Early pruning during the dormant period of the vine makes the wound more susceptible to disease. They gradually invade the vascular tissue of the trunk and thread their way to the roots.

On red-skinned varieties, leaf tissue between the veins turns deep red to purple and leaf margins curl downward or take a cup-like shape. On white varieties, the leaf tissue will turn yellow with curling or cupping of the leaf margins. In general, the main veins may remain green, although in some cases the discoloration affects the whole leaf tissue. Vines may have a reduced growth, shorter canes and smaller canopies. Over the years, the disease may result in delayed and uneven ripening of fruit, a reduction in sugar content, discoloration of the berry, and an increase in acidity. Over the years, the decline of the grapevines is obvious, which reduces the lifespan of affected vineyards. It is a serious disease of grapevines that is of major importance worldwide.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSorry, we don't know of any alternative treatment against grapevine leafroll disease. Please get in touch with us in case you know of something that might help to fight this disease. Looking forward hearing from you.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Viral diseases cannot be treated with chemical compounds. In vineyards with drip irrigation, some insecticides can be used against mealybugs any time during the season. Foliar sprays with products containing acetamiprid can be applied to the trunk and main branches in vineyards that are not drip irrigated. Other cultural and biological practices are available to control mealybugs and scales.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms of grapevine leafroll disease are caused by a group of ten different viruses that are collectively referred to as grapevine leafroll-associated viruses. Vegetative propagation, transport of infected plant material and grafting are the most common ways to spread the disease to distant locations. Moreover, two insect vectors, mealybugs and soft scales, can also transmit them locally between vines and sometimes vineyards. These viruses are not known to be transmitted mechanically, for example through pruning equipment or harvesters, nor are they known to be transmitted by seeds. Symptoms of phosphorus and potassium deficiencies resemble those caused by grape leafroll disease. Therefore, the infection needs to be confirmed prior to management decision-making.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCheck quarantine regulations if applicable in your country.\\nSelect planting material that is certified to be free of leafroll virus.\\nChoose resistant varieties if available.\\nMonitor the vineyard regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nCheck for the presence of mealybugs and soft scales in vineyards with confirmed grape leafroll disease.\\nIn case of doubt, have your vines tested for the virus in a laboratory.\\nRemove and destroy virus-infected vines, including the root system.\\nAvoid top-grafting, as the rootstocks may be infected.\\nDo not transport potentially infected plant material to other vineyards.\"},\n",

It is a pest in many areas of the world where pistachios are grown and has the potential to reduce yields. The species can be introduced into new areas via infested and improperly fumigated seeds or ornamental trees that are also alternate hosts. With this pest it is important to examine nuts for small holes and use yellow sticky traps to monitor adults.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nRemoving all nuts after harvest is an effective way to prevent hibernating larvae to produce adult wasps in the spring.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Apply insecticides from the onset of adult emergence. Repeated spraying should be done every 7-10 days until harvest, even after the hardening of the hull. Products based on deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin can be used. The efficacy of treatments depends on the timing of application, the adequacy between the volume of the product applied and that of the trees, the use of the recommended dose and the speed of the atomizer.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the pistachio seed chalcid (Megastigmus pistaciae), a wasp that has two generations per year. It overwinters as larva in the infested pistachio nuts. In the spring, the larvae transform into adult wasps, which exit the nut by chewing a tiny exit hole (1 mm) through the hard shell. These newly emerged females lay their eggs through the hardening shells of ripening nuts in May and June. The second adult generation emerges in the mid- to late-summer. Some of the larvae actually do not emerge as adults in the same year but remain latent in the nuts until the following spring. These females lay through hard shells of ripe nuts, producing a new batch of overwintering larvae.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the orchard and examine nuts for small holes to determine presence of pest.\\nRemove and destroy remaining nuts on the tree after harvest as well as those that have fallen to the soil.\\nPlow the soil to bury the infected fruits.\\nUse yellow sticky traps in early August to monitor and control adults.\\nProtect fruits with insect mesh protection netting.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Armillaria Root Rot\\n\\nSymptoms\\nRoots of trees infected with Armillaria mellea show rotting in the form of white to yellowish, fan-shaped fungal mats between the bark and the wood. Dark brown to black fungal threads (called rhizomorphs) can sometimes be seen on the root surface and honey-colored mushrooms grow at the base of the tree. Affected trees often show a general decline in vigor, noted by yellowing foliage, dieback of twigs and branches, and reduced leaf size and number. The decay and collapse of the wood may happen suddenly or over several years. Initially the diseased trees are scattered but due to the concentric spread of the fungus from its primary infection point, circular areas of diseased trees appear. In the absence of mushrooms, the symptoms can be easily confused with Phytophthora root rot or any other root problem caused by a fungus or nematodes.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTrees infected with Armillaria mellea usually cannot be saved. Trees, stumps and any large remaining roots need to be removed and burned. The hole should be left open for about a year (solarization). At early stages of the diseases, excavating the soil around the base of the tree down to the first layer of lateral roots may delay the progress of the disease because it prevents the fungus from gaining access to the crown of the tree.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Soil fumigation with carbon disulphide may ensure absence of Armillaria mellea in an orchard prior to planting the young trees. The application of the products can also be carried out by irrigation, but never by spraying. Irrigate the feet early in the attack when the vegetation is yellowing with products containing phosetyl aluminum, metalaxyl or thiophanate-methyl fungicides. To prevent the spread of the disease, agricultural tools should be disinfected with bleach or after use.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused by multiple fungi within the genus Armillaria, among other A. mellea, and has a wide range of hosts. It shows varying symptoms depending on both the species of fungus and the host in question. The fungus survives on dead roots in the soil or the lower severed stumps for several years in the absence of host. They do so by forming resistant bodies called rhizomorphs. When conditions are favorable, it grows and produces thread-like extensions that spread in the soil in a concentric way in search of healthy roots. This explains why trees usually die in a circular area, that expands each year as the fungus grows along roots of infected trees over to roots of adjacent healthy trees. In general, they infect and kill trees that have been already weakened by other fungi or insects. They can be a problems in orchards that have been planted in recently cleared forestlands.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChose resistant or resilient varieties, if available in the area.\\nDo not plant tree crops in newly cleared forest or on the site of old orchards with a history of Armillaria for at least 3 years.\\nDo not plant trees of the same family in orchards with an history of the disease.\\nMake sure to have a good drainage and avoid water stagnation near the trunk.\\nAvoid high densities of trees at planting.\\nMonitor the orchard regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nMaintain plant health by fertilizing as needed.\\nWater regularly during droughts but avoid excess irrigation.\\nTake care not to wound the plants or trees during field work.\\nPrune diseased branches during winter pruning.\\nControl insects that damage roots and other stresses such as drought and poor water regime.\\nPull out diseased trees and burn them after the harvest.'},\n",

Because of their bark is more robust, healthy trees are less prone to get infested. Exit or entry holes with frass can be found on the trunk or branches. If the bark is cut out and removed, a arrangement of tunnels can be found directly on the sapwood. Females gnaw a longitudinal mother gallery of about 5-6 cm in length (up to 10 cm), and 2 mm in width. As it does so, it lays eggs on small cavities in the sides of this tunnel. After hatching, the larvae bore slightly shorter and narrower galleries underneath the bark, starting from the mother tunnel and nearly perpendicular to it. This characteristic tunneling resembles a Mayan quipu.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nScolytus mali has a large number of predators but few studies have looked at their possible use as biological control in the field. Many species of birds predate on the larvae of Scolytus mali. Braconid parasitoid wasps of the species Spathius brevicaudis could also be effective to control populations. Other wasps of the Chalcid type could also be used (Cheiropachys colon or Dinotiscus aponius, among others).\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Pesticide treatments are necessary if populations reach infestation levels and are most effective during the flight of adults. No insecticides are currently available for combating the Fruit Tree Bark Beetle.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms observed on fruit trees are caused by the beetle Scolytus mali. The larvae of these insects are xylophagous, meaning that they feed from the sapwood below the bark. Adults are shining reddish-brown, with a black head and about 2.5-4.5 mm long. Females usually choose weakened trees, pierce a hole through the bark and bore a tunnel into the sapwood. The eggs are laid along this mother gallery, which can reach up to 10 cm in length. After hatching, the larvae bore slightly shorter and narrower galleries underneath the bark, starting from the mother tunnel and nearly perpendicular to it. In spring, the larvae pupate in a nest there. At constant warm temperatures (18-20°C), the adult beetles hatch, bore a tunnel through the bark and fly to other suitable trees to start a new cycle. Infestation is a sign of an existing weakening of the trees, caused e.g. by fungal infection or unfavorable soil conditions.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nEnsure a balanced nutrition to the trees.\\nEnsure sufficient water supply but do not overwater.\\nDo not store firewood close to fruit trees.\\nUse pheromone traps to monitor the populations.\\nTrap trees or trap branches could also be effective.\\nPrune and burn infected branches or trees.'},\n",

As they enlarge, a gray center develops in the middle of these spots and a reddish-brown margin becomes visible. Stems also become discolored. On susceptible varieties, lesions may reach a length of 5-14 mm and can cause leaves to wilt. On resistant varieties, the lesions are yellow-brown and pinhead-sized. The infection of florets leads to incomplete or disrupted grain filling and a reduction in grain quality.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo be sure that the seeds are not contaminated, a seed bath in hot water (53-54°C) for 10 to 12 minutes is recommended.

It can survive in seeds for more than four years and spread from plant to plant through airborne spores. Infected plant debris left in the field and weeds are other common ways to spread the disease. Brown spots can occur at all crop stages, but the infection is most critical from maximum tillering to ripening stages. The disease often occurs in fields with mismanagement of soil fertility, mainly in terms of micronutrients. Significant control of brown spot has been achieved using silicon fertilizers. The use of a mixture of cattle manure and chemical fertilizers somewhat also reduces its severity. High humidity (86-100%), prolonged periods of leaf moisture and high temperatures (16-36°C) are very favorable for the fungi.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nFor soils that are low in silicon, apply calcium silicate slag before planting.\\nUse resistant varieties, if available.\\nAcquire your seeds from certified sources if possible.\\nEnsure a balanced nutrient supply and monitor soil nutrients regularly.\\nMonitor fields for signs of the disease from the tillering stage.\\nControl and remove weeds in and around your field.\\nRemove and destroy infected plants, by burning them after the harvest.'},\n",

The spots expand into larger round spots that turn bright orange to red and finally brown with a yellow border. On the lower side of the leaf, the corresponding spots begin to produce spores that look like powder ranging from orange to brown colour. The leaves eventually fall off the tree. Due to the absence of leaves, photosynthesis cannot take place, and the plants lack nutrients thus having significantly lower coffee yields.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nCommercial biocontrol strategies for controlling the disease are not highly available. Taking prevention into account will provide the most significant results in controlling the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach along with preventive measures and available biological treatments. Prophylactic spraying of Bordeaux mixture or Copper Oxychloride 50% WG can be done, once before the occurrence of favourable environmental factors to the disease and again after cessation of this period.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix. Coffee rust spreads very quickly and environmental factors play a significant role in the spread of the fungus. The most significant means of spread is through wind or water. They are transmitted when the dust and the fungal spores drift across the field and infect another field, or when they fall to the ground and splash onto the next plant when it rains. Coffee rust thrives in wet humid environments and the splashing of rainwater on leaves contributes to the spread of the spores from tree to tree.

Bark below the soil line turns water soaked, slimy, reddish-brown, or black in late stages. Brown necrotic areas can extend to internal tissues of wood. Foliage turns yellow due to nutrition deficiency. At later stages, the dead bark dries, shrinks and cracks and patches may fall off, leaving an open canker. Trees may collapse and die if the fungus encircles the bark. Infected fruits develop a soft brown rot that eventually produces a characteristic pungent odor.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nExposing the seeds to hot water (about 49 degrees) for 4-10 minutes eradicates seedborne infection. The insertion of chlorine into micro-irrigation systems effectively reduces Phytophthora infections. Some fungal or bacterial species (Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus spp.) have been tested as control agents for Phytophthora with good results. Copper fungicides can also be used to control the disease at early stages.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. The treatment of the orchard with fungicides containing metalaxyl and fosetyl-aluminium is an effective complement to preventive and biological control of the fungus. Foliar applications of fosetyl-aluminium and a soil drench of metalaxyl showed very good results. Both preharvest sprays, postharvest dip treatments and/or the use of impregnated wrappers is recommended.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by different species of Phytophthora fungi. They produce a large number of water-borne spores that under favorable conditions (high moisture and elevated temperatures) can swim over short distances. These spores are the infective agents that may be transported in rain or irrigation to the roots of the trees. They germinate and enter the root tip resulting in rot of the entire rootlet, later extending to the rest of the root. Foot rot or gummosis occur when these spores are splashed onto a wound or bark crack around the base of the trunk. The susceptibility of the tree depends on the Phytophthora species present and is greatly influenced by the prevailing environmental conditions (type of soil, presence of water).\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nSow seeds from certified sources.\\nSelect resistant or tolerant varieties for the orchard.\\nThe nursery site should be well drained.\\nMake sure that tools are disinfected before use.\\nPlant the trees on cambered beds to prevent losses from the disease.\\nAvoid wounding, especially near the trunk base.\\nRemove dead or infected tree material immediately.\\nInspect the orchard regularly for signs of the disease down to the first lateral roots.\\nAvoid contact between furrow irrigation water and the trunk of trees.'},\n",

The early stage of attack is recognizable by small feeding punctures at the side of the flower bud or small wart-like growth corresponding to oviposition sites. Damage to the flower buds causes discoloration and may result in abortion or premature dropping of flowers or small bolls (with the larva inside). Large, punctured bolls usually remain on the plant and may not open. Alternatively, they can be attacked by opportunistic pathogens that may cause them to rot. Adults feeding on leaf petioles during the vegetative growth of the plant causes leaves to wilt and wither while remaining attached to the stems, a trait that is commonly known as \"black flags\".\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nParasitic wasps like Catolaccus grandis can be introduced or promoted to control the weevil.

Adult beetles are about 6 mm long with long slender snouts and vary in color from dark, brownish-red to brown or near black. They overwinter in well-drained areas in or near the cotton fields. After this period of suspended development, they emerge and enter cotton fields from early spring through midsummer, with peak emergence in late spring, during the development of the boll. Females lay eggs in the growing cotton bolls, usually one egg per square. The creamy-white, legless, C-shape larvae feed within the square or boll for about 10 days and later pupate there. The life cycle from egg to adult spans about three weeks during the summer.

Small, light-colored spots appear first on the skin of fruits. As they mature, the spots grow considerably in size (up to 5 cm) and become round, dark brown lesions, often with a water-soaked or raised appearance. Pinkish to orange specks grow within the lesions in a concentric manner. Smaller, reddish-brown, sunken spots (up to 2 cm), referred to as \"chocolate spots\", are also visible.

Under severe infestation the wood becomes so weak that branches may break or the main stem collapses. Branches or even the entire tree may appear wilted. Ejected frass can be found in bark cracks or at the base of the tree. Exit holes in tree bark are indicators for infestation. Foliage and fruit production will also be affected by the infestation and can lead to yield losses. Most damage is caused by the larvae that initially bore into the sub-cortex of the tree and later move deeper into the tree. The adults chew on the green growing tips and on the barks of twigs. Grub tunnels in the sapwood on the trunk or branches. Grub bore into the sapwood and make irregular tunnels. They feed on the vascular tissues and as a result in interruption of nutrient and water transport on the tissue. Drying of terminal shoot in early stage.

Wilting of branches or the entire tree in case of young plants or if there are many grubs in a single trees.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nMetarhizium anisopliae or Beaveria bassianna can be used to manage the pest population.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Insecticides like organophosphates should be applied to the main trunk, branches and exposed roots when adult beetles have been spotted. Clean entry holes and fill them with cotton wool soaked in emulsion of carbofuran (3 G at 5 g per hole) and plug them with mud. Older larvae hiding in their burrows can be killed in situ by the injection of a volatile liquid or fumigant. Apply bordeaux paste up to one meter high on the trunk from ground level which will prevent egg laying. Padding with Monocrotophos (36 WSC 10 ml in 2.5cm/tree) and soaked in absorbent cotton. Apply Copper Oxychloride paste on the trunk of the tree if infestations are high.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larval and adult stage of Batocera rufomaculata. The beetles are 25-55 mm long with body long antennae and nocturnal. The female beetle cuts in the bark of damaged or stressed trees and lays its eggs in these areas. Alternatively eggs are laid in roots that are exposed by soil erosion. Larvae feed under the bark of main stems, larger branches or exposed roots. At a later larval stage they also bore deeper into the wood and pupate there. The adults emerge from an exit hole and feed on the bark of twigs and growing tips. Adults are 3-5 cm, grayish brown, with 2 kidney shaped orange-yellow spots on the sides of the thorax. Fully grown larvae are cream colored with a dark brown head and are up to 10 cm long. Larval development often requires more than one year. The larvae bore through the sapwood and because of their size, the large tunnels adversely affect foliage and fruit production. Pupation takes within the stem, the adult beetles emerging in late summer. They are nocturnal, may live for several months and can fly for long distances, facilitating their dispersal. The pest has only a single annual generation.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse tolerant varieties if available.\\nUse a knife or a piece of wire to destroy larvae and eggs in the entry holes in the bark.\\nThe holes can then be filled with cotton wool soaked in kerosene oil, crude oil or formalin which is able to kill the larvae.\\nRemove severely affected branches and cut down heavily infested trees.\\nRemove alternate host plants from and around your field.\\nClean out entry holes with an iron hook or wire and plug holes with cotton wool soaked in kerosene oil, crude oil or formalin which is capable of killing the larvae.\\nOther methods involve cutting down infested trees, sawing off severely affected branches and the removal of alternate hosts plants.'},\n",

The specks form around the oil glands present on the skin. Wound tissue and cracking is common in the process of infection. Fruits may be stunted and fall prematurely. Contrarily to similar spots caused by other diseases, melanose spots have a sandpaper-like texture when touched. On fully mature fruits the pathogen causes fruit rot, which typically develops from the stalk and may also cause early fruit fall. Foliar symptoms appear first as small brown discrete spots that later develop into raised pustules impregnated with a reddish-brown gum. They are often surrounded by a yellow halo, eventually forming small, hard corky pustules. Under storage conditions, stem-end rot may occur.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nUse sprays containing organic copper compounds to treat D. citri. Initial application should take place at petal fall, followed by a secondary treatment 6-8 weeks later.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Applications of pyraclostrobin during the spring flush growth has been proved effective against the development of melanose on fruits. Products based on mancozeb and fenbuconazole are also recommended. Strobilurin fungicides have also given satisfying results and may also be applied.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nMelanose is a decomposing organism, that completes its life cycle on dead twigs. The severity of the disease is determined by the amount of fungal growth on dead wood and the duration of continuous wetting periods following rainfall or overhead sprinkler irrigation. Around 18-24 hours of wetting and temperatures between 20-24 °C are required for infection to occur.

Below ground symptoms include the development of knotted swellings on the roots and a loss of the smaller roots (also called root hairs). Over time, the swellings lead to a severe distortion, ending up in club-shaped aspect of the roots instead of the normal fine network (thereby the common name of the disease). Growth and yield are severely reduced and very badly affected plants may die.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe only organic control available is to raise the pH of the soil to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into the soil in the fall (small gardeners and farmers). Simple and affordable soil test kits are available to check pH often.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

The raising of the pH (7.2) through addition of limestone (calcium carbonate CaC03) and hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2) before planting is a way to reduce the incidence of the disease.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms of the disease are caused by the infection of the roots by the soil-dwelling pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae. It is an obligate parasite that affects, among other plants, a series of important crops, such as Brussels sprouts, cabbages, cauliflowers, turnips, and radishes. The strategy of the fungus is to produce dormant spores that can contaminate soil for up to 20 years. In the presence of susceptible plant roots, these spores germinate and infect the root hairs, causing the swellings in the roots that give the disease its name. These swellings then produce more spores that are released to the soil, completing the cycle. The disease is favored by moist and warm soils.

Emerging seedlings can also be attacked, resulting in patches of wilted growth in the field or simply gaps in the rows. Typically, the stem of the injured plants turns purple, indicating phosphorus deficiency. Cool, wet soils will exacerbate the situation because the growth of corn seedlings will be slowed and remain susceptible for a longer time.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNatural enemies that control white grubs include parasitic wasps in the genera Tiphia and Myzinum, and the species Pelecinus polyturator. Parasitic flies include the species Pyrgota undata. The fungi in the genus Cordyceps also infect the larvae and can be used in solutions to control their populations. Inoculating the soil with bacterial spores of Bacillus popilliae and Bacillus lentimorbus can also help to reduce populations. All of these products are available commercially.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways include an integrated approach with both preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Management of white grubs requires a thorough monitoring of the fields before planting to detect their presence. Fumigation with soil insecticides can be used to reduce populations to an acceptable level. Seeds treatment also helps to reduce the impact of white grubs in some cases but usually no chemical treatment is recommended.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of several beetles belonging to the genus Phyllophaga (over 100 different species). Other types of beetles may be involved and therefore, it is important to learn how to recognize them. The beetles are about 12 to 25 mm long, yellow to reddish-brown or black, robust, and with an oblong shape. Larvae are whitish with a brown head and C-shaped, 20 to 45 mm in length and with three pairs of legs.

Use “prahok” (local ‘cheese’ in Cambodia) near the field to attract the rice bug and kill it. Use a mosquito net in the early morning or late afternoon to remove the rice bug, crush it and put it in water then spray it to expel other rice bugs. Encourage biological control agents: some wasps, grasshoppers, and spiders attack rice bugs or rice bug eggs.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. The benefits of using an insecticide must be weighed against the risks to health and the environment. Spray chlorpyriphos 50 EC at 2.5 ml in the evening hours by starting from the field edges to the center in a circular manner. This brings the bugs to the center and allows to manage them effectively. Alternatively you can also use abamectin.

Immature and adult rice bugs both feed on rice grains. Rice bugs suck out the contents of developing grains. They are actually found in all rice environments. Woodlands, extensive weedy areas near rice fields, wild grasses near canals, and staggered rice planting favors high population densities. They are more active when monsoonal rains begin. Warm weather, overcast skies, and frequent drizzles favor its population build-up. They are less active during the dry season.

       "  'data': 'Head Miner\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe head miner has a life cycle tightly linked to the development of millet plants. After hatching, the caterpillars feed and complete their larval development within the panicle. As the seed head develops, the young larvae perforate millet glumes and eat the flowers, whereas mature larvae cut the floral peduncles, thereby preventing grain formation or causing mature grains to spill. As the larvae chew between the rachis and flowers, they lift the destroyed flowers or developing grains, leaving a characteristic spiral pattern on the millet head.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nHabrobracon hebetor is a natural parasitoid of the head miner and has successfully been released in infested millet fields in some African countries, in some cases reaching up to 97% mortality and lead to a significant gain in grain yield.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. There is no chemical control that provides effective control over H. albipunctella at the moment.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the millet head miner, Heliocheilus albipunctella. The flight period of the adult moth coincides with the peak of millet panicle emergence and flowering. Females lay eggs individually or in small clusters stuck loosely to the rachis, or at the base of florets or their peduncles in early emergence of the flower head. After the eggs hatch, young larvae feed on the panicle, and older individuals cause typical pattern of spiral tunnels. Full-grown larvae turn reddish or pinkish and fall on the ground, where it enters the soil to pupate. They remain in that stage in diapause during the whole dry season and emerge only as adults the following rainy season. This pest is rated as the most damaging pest of pearl millet panicles in the Sahelian region of West Africa.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor panicles and the ground regularly for larvae.\\nRemove panicles and destroy them by burying or burning at a distance to the field.\\nA two-week delay in planting of short cycle millet varieties (75 days to maturity) may help to desynchronize the peak flight period of the susceptible stage of the crop.\\nEnsure deep plowing after harvest to expose larvae and pupae.'},\n",

These burrows are usually limited by the leaf veins and contain black fecal material visible as slim trace inside the tunnels. Entire leaves may be covered with mines. Damaged leaves may drop prematurely (defoliation). Defoliation can reduce yield and fruit size and expose fruit to sunburn. Should not be confused with Tuta absoluta (Tomato Leafminer) whose mines on leaves are wider and white or transparent.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSpray neem oil products (Azadirachtin) against larvae onto leaves in the early morning or late evening. For example, spray Neem oil (15000 ppm) at a rate of 5 ml/l. Make sure to have good leaf coverage. Neem slightly enters the leaves and reaches some of the larvae inside the tunnel. Foliar applications of the entomophagous nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae, can reduce the leaf miner population. Other biological controls of leaf miners include parasitoids (e.g. Chrysonotomyia punctiventris and Ganaspidium hunteri) and nematodes (e.g. Steinernema carpocapsae).\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Broad-spectrum insecticides of the organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids families prevent adults from laying eggs, but they do not kill the larvae. Moreover, they can lead to the decrease of natural enemies and the development of resistance in the fly, which in some cases can actually result in an increase in their numbers. Products such as abamectin, chlorantraniliprole, acetamiprid, spinetoram or spinosad can be used in a rotation to avoid the development of resistance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by several flies belonging to the family of the Agromyzidae, with several thousand species worldwide. In spring, females puncture leaf tissues and lay their eggs, usually along the margins. The larvae feed between the upper and the lower leaf surface. They produce large white meandering tunnels with a trail of black frass left behind as they feed. Once they have reached maturity, larvae open a hole on the underside of the leaf and fall to the ground, where they pupate. Plant debris near the host are alternative pupating places. Leaf miner flies are attracted to the color yellow.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nFavor crop varieties with curled leaves.\\nCheck transplants for leaf miners or mines before planting.\\nDestroy any transplants that are infested.\\nMonitor weekly and at all growth stages of the crop.\\nLook for tiny tunnels and larvae inside the tunnels on the upper leaf sides.\\nUse glue traps or yellow sticky traps to detect leaf miners.\\nAt 8 to 12 infected plants per 100 plants, consider direct control action.\\nHandpick heavily-infested leaves, and destroy them by crushing or burying them, or feeding them to cattle if palatable.\\nDestroy and bury the remains of weeds and dying crops.\\nRemove crop debris immediately afert harvest is finished, especially for tomato crop.'},\n",

These spots gradually dry and die, turning white to gray and becoming angular. Often, the lesions are surrounded by a yellowish halo. Their center may tear away, leaving ragged holes in the leaves. Most severe symptoms develops on the infected fruits, and resemble insect stings. Small (about 3 mm), gray, slightly sunken, gum-oozing spots appear first. Later, the spots enlarge and finally become distinct sunken cavities or scabs. Affected fruit are often invaded by opportunistic pathogens such as soft-rotting bacteria that produce a mushy, foul-smelling decay. On highly resistant fruits, especially on certain squashes and pumpkins, irregular, knob-like formations may develop.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDirect biological treatment of cucumber scab is not possible. Use fungicides based on a copper-ammonium complex that is certified organic to slow down the spread of the pathogen.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

Fungicides containing dithiocarbamates, maneb, mancozeb, metiram, chlorothalonil and anilazine are also effective against C. cucumerinum.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are cause by the fungus Cladosporium cucumerinum, which overwinters in plant residues, in cracks in the soil or on infected seeds. Early spring infection may come from either of these sources. The fungus begins to develop spore-producing structures and release spores. Spores are spread by insects, clothing or tools, or are blown long distances in moist air. High air humidity and moderate temperatures increase the risk of infection. Temperatures around 17 °C and alternating between 12-25 °C, together with moist weather, frequent fogs, dews or light rain are the most favorable for the development of the fungus.

As the disease progresses, the sori turn black. In case of pearl millet smut, the ovaries are converted into sori in the infected florets. The smut sori are usually larger in size than normal grains and are formed in place of normal grains projecting out from between the glumes. In early stages, the colour of sori remains bright green that slowly turns brown to black on maturity. The normal grain contents are replaced by black, dense, powdery mass of spores. Sori are covered by a thin film, which breaks at maturity, and releases brownish black spore mass. On ripening, sori releases many spores in the air, which cause further infection on healthy ear heads. The smut fungus gradually replaces the grain content with black powdery mass and the sori finally consist of remains of host tissue and the spores. The entire grain content is replaced by black dense spore mass but the membrane covering the smut remains intact.

       "  'data': \"Poplar Lace bug\\n\\nSymptoms\\nAdults and nymphs of poplar lace bug feed on the underside of leaves by sucking fluids from the leaf tissues. This causes a pale stippling and bleaching on the upper leaf surface that can become very obvious by mid to late summer. While they feed, they foul the underside of leaves with specks of dark excrement, that sometimes drips onto pavement and other surfaces beneath infested trees. A prolonged exposure of almond trees to high populations of poplar lace bugs may cause premature leaf drop (or defoliation) and a reduction in plant growth. The symptoms caused by this pest are not unique. Certain other true bugs and thrips also produce leaf stippling and dark excrement. Mite infestations do show stippling but not dark excrement, and rather display mite cast skins and fine silken webbing. Examining trees with a magnifying glass can help identify the cause of the symptoms.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIn orchards with a history of infestation with this pest, inspect plants about once a week beginning of late winter. Take action when lace bug nymphs become abundant and before damage becomes extensive. A forceful stream of water directed at the underside of leaves early in the season, when nymphs are the predominant life stage, and repeated at intervals, can help to suppress populations on young trees. Treatments with insecticidal soap, narrow-range oil, neem oil, and natural pyrethrins could also be envisaged.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Contact insecticides that do not leave persistent, toxic residues (which may kill natural enemies of lace bugs) include azadirachtin and pyrethroids, which are often combined with piperonyl butoxide, a compound that enhances their effects.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the poplar lace bug Monosteira unicostata. Adults are about 3 mm long and have forewings with numerous, semitransparent cells that give the body a lace-like appearance. They can overwinter as eggs in leaves on evergreen hosts or as adults in protected locations, such as under bark plates and fallen leaves or other debris beneath the trees. With the arrival of the spring they emerge and recover their activity, settling on the leaves. Female insert tiny, oblong eggs, in isolation or in groups, close to the main veins on the underside of leaves and cover them with dark excrement. Nymphs appear at 10-18 days, forming colonies and feeding gregariously by piercing and sucking the leaf sap. They reach adulthood after about 10 days, passing through five nymphal states. All life stages can be present throughout the year on evergreen hosts in areas with mild winters. Lace bugs develop through egg, nymph, and adult life stage, and have several generations a year.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the orchard regularly for symptoms of the pest.\\nIf infection does not involve defoliation and does not seriously harm the trees, it could be wise to tolerate them because the injury is mostly aesthetic.\\nApply balanced fertilization and irrigation to increase the almond trees' natural resistance against sucking insects.\\nDo not use broad-scale insecticides which may kill all kinds of predatory insects of lace bugs.\\nIncrease the abundance of natural enemy by growing a variety of flowering plant species.\\nPrune infected tree parts and destroy the debris.\"},\n",

It enters the vascular tissue of the plant through the rootlets or wounds in the bark. Once inside the plant or the tree, it grows rapidly and blocks the transport of water and nutrients, resulting in the wilting and decay of the aerial parts (leaves and stems).

Exit or entry holes with frass can be found on the trunk or branches. If the bark is cut out and removed, a network of galleries can be found directly on the sapwood. The beetles’ attack usually destroys the phloem tissues in the inner bark and then disrupts the transport of photosynthetic products.

Larvae mine through leaf stalks and stems, which later appear as silvery, curved stripes. On the upper side of the leaf only a few tunnels are visible, which later turn dark brown and are clearly visible wilt. These leaves may dry out and may even be shed. In infested mature plants stalks becomes swollen and at times the leaves may wilt. The feeding tunnels are clearly visible on the stems. Intense larval feeding leads to destruction of the internal tissue around the root-shoot junction, leading to yellowing of the leaves, stunting of plant growth and even plant death. In most cases the plant is killed within 10-15 days of emergence.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere are several natural enemies of the bean fly. Several braconid wasp larva parasitoids of the Opius species are widely used in both Asia and Africa. Two species, Opius phaseoli and Opius importatus, were introduced into Hawaii in 1969 from East Africa, but occasional outbreaks of bean fly still occur. The pest mortality in some regions reaches up to 90%. Products based on fungal pathogens of the fly were also tested as possible pest management tool in East Africa.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Where infestations are severe, insecticides can be considered for the control of bean fly. However, the larvae which do the damage are well protected inside the plants. Spraying of chemical products containing imidacloprid into the soil simultaneously with sowing of the crop or immediately after germination is effective. Seedlings are treated about 3-4 days after emergence and, if bean fly infestations are severe, repeated at 7 days, and possibly at 14 days. Other commonly used active ingredients are dimethoate, which is systemic. All listed chemicals are classified as hazardous and should be handled with care.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the larvae and adults of the bean fly, Ophiomyia phaseoli, one of the most destructive pests in the world. It is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, Hawaii and Oceania. In some cases, it can lead to yield losses of 30-50%. The severity of the damage seems to be seasonal, resulting in far higher mortality in the dry season that in wet season (80% vs 13% respectively).

Crawler stages are generally the most susceptible to insecticides. As they develop their waxy protection, these insects become more resilient to treatments. Treatments with pyriproxyfen are recommended. Several spray applications at 15-20 day intervals may be necessary for complete management of a heavy infestation.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the coconut scale Aspidiotus destructor. Beside coconut, it attacks tropical trees of economical importance such as mango, palm, papaya, ficus, avocado, and citrus. Like other armored scales, they settle on the underside of leaves in colonies protected by a waxy cover that looked like miniature fried eggs. The deformation of leaf tissues is caused by a toxic saliva that they inject into plant tissues while feeding. Female lay whitish eggs around their own body, literally covering the epidermis in case of heavy infestation. The first nymphs have legs that allow them to move freely to relatively large distances (up to 1 m). These so-called crawlers can also be distributed over much greater distances by wind, flying insects and birds as well as by transport of infested plant material by farmers.

       "  'data': 'Black Scurf\\n\\nSymptoms\\nRaised black spots, irregular in size or shape, appear on the surface of the potato tubers (scurfs). These black marks can be rubbed or scraped off easily. With the help of a hand lens, white fungal material can be observed around these spots. The fungus also causes symptoms resembling those of stem canker on new shoots and stems. Brown, sunken patches develop on the root, often surrounded by white fungal growth. If the rot girdles the stem and blocks water and nutrient transport, the leaves become discolored and withered.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nApply the biological fungicide Trichoderma harzianum, or nonpathogenic Rhizoctonia species in the furrows. This might reduce the incidence of black scurf in fields and the number of infected tubers. Another possibility would be to apply cattle manure to the furrows or bio-fumigation with green mustard residues.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Seed treatments with fluodioxinil or a mixture of thiophanate-methyl and mancozeb are effective against the spreading of a variety of fungal diseases, among them black scurf. In-furrow treatments at planting with fluotanil or azoxystrobin also help to control the progression of the fungus.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBlack scurf is caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani. At temperatures ranging 5 to 25°C the fungus survives in the soil for long periods of time, even in the absence of potatoes. The infection can arise from the soil or from the use of infected tubers as seeding material. The fungi actually do not cause rot, but the tubers should not be used for propagation. The infection can be exacerbated by cold and wet weather. Warm temperatures during early stages of plant development reduce the impact of the disease. Black scurf and stem canker also tend to be more common on lighter, sandier soils.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse seeding material from healthy plants or from certified sources.\\nAvoid planting early in the season.\\nPlant seed tubers in warm soil (above 8°C).\\nConsider the use shallower furrows to allow for earlier shoot emergence from the soil.\\nPractice crop rotation.\\nLeave non-host plant residues in the soil after harvest.\\nWater the plants adequately, especially during dry periods.'},\n",

Over time, the spots enlarge and their central area become necrotic and gradually form a clear and definite concentric zonation. Prolongations of these spots may develop along the veins as the leaf grows. Several spots can coalesce to form large necrotic patches surrounded by yellow tissues. When the leaf margins are infected, small concentric spots develop that are later converted into long stripes of pale brown necrotic tissues. The stripes sometimes extend up to midrib. Diseased leaves may be quite conspicuous as the infected areas are usually surrounded by a bright yellow halo zone.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere are no purely biological solutions against this disease. Therefore, the proper management of the banana field is very important. In severe cases, organic copper formulations, for example, 1% Bordeaux mixture, can be sprayed on infected areas.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Since there are a number of leaf spots diseases in banana, make sure that you are dealing with Cordana leaf spot and not freckle leaf spot or Sigatoka leaf spot for example In severe cases apply 0.4% mancozeb or oil-based formulations of copper oxy chloride at 0.2-0.4%. Contact fungicides like chlorothalonil or mancozeb and a systemic fungicide, e.g. tebuconazole or propiconazol are recommended. Make sure that the applications reach the top leaves as well.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Cordana musae. Also called Cordana leaf spot, it is one of the most important fungal diseases of banana, prevalent in almost all banana growing areas. The inoculum spread through splashing water and wind, which makes its spread particularly devastating in closely planted fields. The growth of the fungus is accelerated in hot and humid condition with frequent rains. The damage to the leaf caused by the infection causes considerable reduction in the photosynthetic area and yield.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse resilient varieties if available in your area (several are on the market).\\nUse proper spacing in order to avoid mutual shading and contact of leaves.\\nMake sure that new plantations are an appropriate distance from diseased plantations.\\nAvoid sprinkler irrigation to minimize the relative humidity and use drip irrigation instead.\\nApply balanced fertilization and avoid particularly excess N fertilizer.\\nRemove infected leaves and burn them.\\nPractice field sanitation by removing old dried hanging leaves.'},\n",

They may cluster in lines and appear as streaks running diagonally across the leaf, or from the midrib to the leaf edge, often along the veins. The larger spots are up to 4mm in diameter and can also appear as streaks. Sometimes the center of these larger spots are lighter in color. Spots may also form on petioles, midribs, transition leaves and bracts. Fruit can also be affected by freckle as early as 2-4 weeks after bunch emergence. Individual spots first appear as minute reddish-brown flecks surrounded by a halo of dark-green, water-soaked tissue.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nAs the infected leaves are the primary source of spores, placing a bag over the bananas, once harvested, creates a barrier to prevent spores from spreading to the fruit. Neem oil applications (1500 ppm) @ 5ml with surf (1g) or sandovit (1ml) per liter of water can be used prophylacticly, at flowering stage of the crop and at first apperance.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Spraying the leaves and fruit with maneb every 2 weeks or once a month throughout the year can remarkably reduce the spread of spores. Spraying fungicides such as folpet, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, triazoles, propiconazole and those of the family of the strobilurins, biweekly can also produce effective results against the disease.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Phyllosticta maculata. It can affect banana plants at all stages of the production cycle and is considered a 'wet spore' organism in that its spores need water as a way of dispersal (raindrops, water splashes, dew droplets for example). Banana freckle may also be spread through the movement of infected plant material and fruits. The freckle spots contain the fungal structures that produce spores. As they germinate, the spores produce filaments that penetrate the host and multiply within and between cells, creating new spots or lesions in the superficial layers of the plant tissue. The incubation period can be as little as 20 days in hot humid weather.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the orchard regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nPrune out infectious plant material and destroy it in distance to the orchard.\\nMake sure to plant in pathogen free fields.\\nPractice proper sanitation methods in equipment, seeds and soil.\"},\n",

Additionally, leaf veins become swollen with shortening of internodes and petioles. Older leaves become leathery and brittle. If plants are infected during the early season, their growth will be stunted, resulting in significant yield reduction. Fruit formation in susceptible cultivars is rudimentary and distorted. The virus causes similar symptoms as the feeding damage of thrips and mites.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nControl whitefly populations to reduce transmission of the virus. Neem oil or horticultural oils (petroleum-based oils) can be used. Make sure the oils thoroughly cover the plants, particularly the lower side of the leaves where whiteflies are most likely to be found. Some natural enemies such as lacewings, big-eyed bugs, and minute pirate bugs can control whitefly populations.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. There are no known effective methods for preventing or reducing chilli leaf curl virus. Follow chemical control methods, such as imidacloprid or dinotefuran. Spray seedlings with imidacloprid or lambda-cyhalothrin before transplanting to control the vector. Excessive use of insecticides will harm beneficial insects and also make many whitefly species to become resistant. To prevent this, ensure proper rotation between insecticides and use only selective ones.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by begomovirus, which is primarily transmitted through whiteflies in a persistent manner. They are characterized as 1.5 mm long, waxy white wings with a pale yellow body and are frequently found on the lower side of the leaves. The spread of the disease depends on the wind condition, which will indicate how far the whiteflies can travel. Whiteflies are most problematic in the mid-to-late season. Since the disease is not seed-borne, the virus persists in the landscape via alternative hosts (such as tobacco and tomato) and weeds. Some additional factors that can favor the development of the disease are recent rainfall, infected transplants, and the presence of weeds. In nurseries, chilli plants are most prone to infection during the seedling and vegetative stages.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse the available plant-resistant species and extract seeds only from virus-free plants.\\nRaise at least two rows of a barrier crop such as maize, sorghum or pearl millet around your fields.\\nControl whitefly population and protect particularly seedlings from them by establishing nylon nets over the nursery plants.\\nMonitor regularly to detect early infections by looking for symptoms of curled leaves and stunted growth.\\nPosition a number of sticky yellow traps or sheets in your field that attracts whiteflies.\\nControl the vector by growing the seedlings under the net, which can also prevent whiteflies attack the seedlings.\\nEnsure a weed-free field and surroundings.\\nCollect and destroy early infested plants by burning them.\\nPlow deep or burn all plant debris after harvest.\\nEncourage beneficial insects by growing mixed cropping.'},\n",

       "  'data': \"Citrus Psyllid\\n\\nSymptoms\\nCitrus psyllids affect trees in different ways, depending on the growth stage and the time of the season. Feeding by adults and nymphs may damage and weaken the season's new flush, that is buds, flowers, tender shoots, and small fruits. The abundant honeydew produced during the feeding on the sugary sap also results in the growth of sooty mold and the reduction of photosynthetic activity of the leaves. Finally, at high population densities, the twisting and curling of new leaves and the reduction of of shoot length often lead to a witches' broom effect. Large populations retard the growth of young trees and cause significant yield reductions. This insect can become extremely damaging because it is also a main vector of the citrus greening pathogen.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPredators and parasitoids are more likely to provide sustained control during periods of low psyllid populations, for example during hot, dry weather. Parasitic wasps include Tamarixia radiata or Psyllaephagus euphyllurae. Predatory insects include the pirate bug Anthocoris nemoralis, the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea and the lady beetle Coccinella septempunctata. Insecticidal soaps based on neem oil or horticultural oil also work to control populations but should be applied before the nymphs secrete their protective wax.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Timely sprays of insecticides based on dimethoate are effective against psyllids, but should only be used as a last resort. These products should be applied before the insects secrete the protective wax that confers them some resistance. Remember that excessive sprays could easily result in resurgence of psyllids and other pests. Bark can be treated with dimethoate paste (0.03%) to decimate migrating adults moving up and down the tree.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri. Adults are 3 to 4 mm long with brownish black heads and thorax, light brown abdomen and mottled membranous wings. They may overwinter in sheltered areas of the trunk or on mature leaves. The average lifespan of an adult psyllid depends on the temperature, 20 - 30 °C being optimal. Cooler weather favors longer life spans while hot temperatures shorten them. Females can lay up to 800 orange eggs on the new shoots and buds in spring. Nymphs are flat, usually yellow, and secrete a white waxy coating that protects them. White waxy outgrowths or threads clearly distinguish them from aphids. Compared to adults, nymphs only move over short distances if disturbed. The damage to tissues impairs the ability of the plant to distribute nutrients to all parts.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor plants regularly for signs of psyllid populations, starting at the beginning of spring.\\nUse sticky traps as recommended to catch the adults.\\nKeep sufficient space between trees at planting.\\nMake sure not to affect predator populations by overuse of broad-scale insecticides.\\nEnsure an adequate air circulation of the foliage as well as a good exposure to the sun, to create an unfavorable environment to the psyllid.\\nAvoid excessive fertilizer use during the season.\\nWater orchards regularly during the dry season to avoid drought stress.\\nClean orchards free of old branches and debris after harvest.\"},\n",

Some 2-4 days after the appearance of these symptoms, small chlorotic spots appear at the base of young developing leaves. As they grow, these spots coalesce and turn into stripes that run along the veins, often up to the tip. Plants infected at early stages are severely stunted, with twisted and distorted leaves and very short internodes. Multiple ear shoots and new tillers may develop, sometimes as many as 6-7 on a single plant, giving it a bushy appearance. Ears are smaller than usual and do not fill properly, often with loose grains.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere is no direct biological treatment to control S. kunkelii.

Therefore, preventive measures are key to avoid the incidence of both leafhoppers and stunt of maize.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms will depend on the variety of maize and the altitude. They are caused by Spiroplasma kunkelii, a bacterial-like organism that only infects maize plants. A number of leafhoppers, e.g. Dalbulus maidis, D. eliminatus, Exitianus exitiosus, Graminella nigrifons and Stirellus bicolor may carry this pathogen during their overwintering period. When they emerge in early spring, they start to feed on plants and transmit the pathogen. Disease symptoms usually appear about 3 weeks after the maize plant is first infected.

This feeding habit leads to slight depression with red to purple halos on the fruit surface. Although an individual scale cannot inflict much damage, a single female and her offspring can produce several thousand scales in one season. These insects particularly live in large older trees where it is difficult to achieve good spray coverage, but young, sprayed trees may also be vulnerable. Although they primarily live in tree barks, surviving under scales and in crevices, the first indication in the orchard may be small red spots on fruits and leaves. Fruit damage is usually concentrated at the bottom of the fruit. If an infestation occurs early in the season, the fruit may become small or deformed. This leads to an overall decline in plant vigour, growth, and yield.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIntroduce natural enemies that feed on the San Jose Scales such as the twice-stabbed lady beetle or Cybocephalus californicus. Additionally, a few small chalcids and aphelinid wasps parasitise the scale. Spray 2% horticultural oil just before or right after bud break, but before the flowers begin to bud.

Apply Insecticides containing insect growth regulators such as pyriproxyfen or buprofezin, neonicotinoids, organophosphates or spirotetramat when you find the first adults in pheromone traps or the first crawlers on sticky tapes. Follow with subsequent sprays 10 days later if you continue to find active crawlers.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the fruit tree pest of the San Jose scale. The females are yellow, wingless and are soft, globular in shape. They are about 1.5-2.2mm long with a dark band across the back. The nymph goes through three stages of crawler, white cap, and black cap. It can complete its life cycle in approximately 37 days, with two generations of the insect each year. Development of the insect resumes in spring when temperatures exceed 51°F. Overwintering nymphs become active in mid-march and the males emerge in April. Females are ovo-viviparous and reproduce in mid-may producing between 200 and 400 nymphs in a month. A typical life cycle is completed in 35-40 days, and the insects begin to grow during the blooming period. The female scale is round, slightly convex with a black pustule while the male is linear.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nOrchard sanitation should be given top priority.\\nA simple removal of alternative hosts, weeds, volunteer plants, and crop residues can greatly reduce the infesting potential.\\nHeavily infested branches should be pruned, burned and destroyed.\\nExamine trees carefully during dormancy to determine the level of infestation.\\nLook out for trees that retain leaves during winter as this is a good indication of the presence of the insect.\\nUse pheromone traps to detect the presence of males.\\nPlace traps on the northern and eastern side of trees at a height of six to seven feet, and check weekly.\\nInfested branches should be pruned out to reduce the population and improve spray penetration.\\nSpray a delayed dormant oil when buds are showing green issues but before turning pink.\\nInsecticide applications can control newly emerged crawlers in early summer.'},\n",

The fungus easily penetrates through the wounds caused by routine trimming for example. Alternative hosts are limited to the family of nightshade, to which tomato belongs. The spots on the leaves contain the cushions that produce the spores. These are later transported through wind or rain splashes onto healthy plants.

These wingless forms remain on trees and can literally 'pave' the underside of the leaves. Warmer temperature during the summer trigger the appearance of winged adults that move to alternative hosts, particularly reed.

This early hatching can reduce the populations of this insect.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated pest control program with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Crop seeds could be treated with systematic insecticides to prevent the attack by Depois flavopicta.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe Demerara froghopper, also known as spittlebug (Depois flavopicta) is an insect that causes damage to several crops, among others rice and maize. Females lay eggs in the soil, close to the host plants. After hatching, the nymphs start to feed gregariously on roots and stems close to the soil surface. They form a \"spittle mass\", which is a white foamy liquid formed by the introduction of air bubbles into their own secretions. A spittle mass is an evidence of feeding by nymphs on the plant at that location. The presence of susceptible grasses in or around the fields (species of Brachiaria or Axonopus) can increase populations. They are attracted to these plants and use them as alternative host to support their life cycles.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the field for the presence of white foamy liquid on leaves (spittle mass).\\nControl alternative hosts in and around the field.'},\n",

Infected leaves initially show small and green colored lesions under the blade. They later turn yellowish brown and eventually appear as dark brown or black spots. But the most notable symptoms of peach scab occur on the skin of the fruit, where small, velvety, circular spots gradually appear. As they enlarge, they turn darker and may be surrounded by a yellow halo. These symptoms are very similar to the bacterial spots caused the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris. However, peach scab is characterized by the velvety nature of its spots (no pitting of the skin) and the yellow circles that form around them. The infected skin can crack and become distorted, seeping gum.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological treatment seems to be available against this disease. In minor cases of infection, though unmarketable, fruits can still be eaten after peeling.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Fungicide formulations containing captan, chlorothalonil and some other fungicides are recommended against peach scab. A proper use of chlorothalonil requires application starting from the first signs of the disease and a renewed spray every two weeks. By warmer temperature and wet weather, frequent applications will be needed. Applications may be necessary until 4–6 weeks until harvest.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Venturia carpophila, which overwinters in twig or leaf lesions. When it finds favorable conditions during the spring, it starts to produce spores that will be the major source of inoculum. These spores are spread by wind or rain onto the developing young, susceptible twigs, fruits, or leaves. Infections are more severe during late winter or early spring because the dispersal of the fungi is favored by wet and warm environment. Infection involves an incubation period about 45 days and up to 77 days until primary symptoms appear on peach trees. The cutting of the infected shoots and the removal the mummified fruits (dehydrated fruits that remain on the tree) are good practices to prevent further spread of the fungus in the orchard.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nAvoid planting fruit trees in areas that are low-lying or shaded.\\nImprove the air circulation of the canopy through proper pruning or keeping sufficient space between trees.\\nMake sure the orchards have a proper drainage.\\nMonitor the orchard regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nIf more than 20 fruits show signs of infection, disease management should be implemented immediately.\\nRemove diseased, mummified fruits, fallen twigs and leaves from the ground around the trees before the growing season.\\nRemove wild or neglected fruit trees in the vicinity of the orchard.\\nPruning should be done regularly.'},\n",

Initially small, irregular, pale yellow spots appear on the upper leaf surfaces. Later, they become grey-brown with a yellowish margin. On the lower side of the leaves, the spots have a grey fuzzy appearance due to the presence of the pathogen. Symptoms frequently occur at low levels throughout the crop canopy. When pods are infected, an encrusted mass of fungal-like growth is visible inside the pods. The infected seed has a dull white appearance and is partially or completely encrusted with the fungus. Lesion size and shape depend on the age of the leaf. Older lesions may turn greyish brown to dark brown with yellow or green margins.

Infestations can lead to yellowing and curling of young leaves, stunted growth of plants and early fall of fruits. The bugs excrete honeydew during sap-sucking and this makes the tissues sticky and prone to be colonized by opportunistic bacteria and fungi. Fruits are particularly susceptible to be attacked and may become deformed or completely coated by wax secretions. Ants may be attracted by the honeydew and may spread the pest to other plants. Older leaves are less likely to become deformed or distorted.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nAt the first sign of slight infestation, smear the colonies of mealybugs with a cotton bud imbued with oil or spirit. You can spray the plants with insecticidal soap. Nearby plants should be sprayed with neem oil or pyrethrins in order to prevent the spread of the population. Natural antagonists include the green lacewing, parasitoid wasps, hoverflies, ladybird beetles, mealybug destroyer and the predator butterfly Spalgis epius.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Treatments against mealybug are difficult because they are protected from adverse environmental conditions by their waxy layers and fibers. However, foliar spray with solutions based on imidacloprid, acetamiprid and chlorpyrifos can be effective against mealybugs.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nMealybugs are oval, wingless insects found in warm or temperate climates. Their body is protected by a layer of thin mealy wax that gives them a cottony appearance. They insert their long piercing and sucking mouthparts (stylets) into plant tissues and suck the sap out of them. The symptoms are a reaction to the toxic substances that they inject into plants while feeding. The eggs of the mealybug are also laid in the soil. After hatching, nymphs and adults can crawl to neighboring plants. They can also be dispersed over large distances by wind, ants, animals, birds or simply during fieldwork activities such as pruning or harvesting. They have an array of alternative hosts such as eggplant and sweet potato, as well as many weeds.

Use insecticides containing Spinosad or Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that do not persist in the environment. A concentration of 0.1%. sprayed as soon as the larvae are discovered and repeated twice is a good alternative to chemical control of these larvae.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. In the case of this moth, the efficacy of alternative products such as spinosad and Bt often does not justify the use of chemical treatments. If appropriate, products based on alpha-cypermethrin, beta-cyfluthrin, bifenthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, diflubenzuron, fenpropathrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, teflubenzuron can be applied. It is important to use pesticides in the frame of well-planed integrated management strategies to avoid deleterious effects to beneficial insects.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the caterpillar of the bright line brown eye moth, Lacanobia oleracea. It prefers humid and nutrient-rich sites and is found in a variety of habitats such as greenhouses, on farmland, along rivers or forest clearings. The adult moth has a wing span of about 35-45 mm, and a light brown body with some slightly darker specimens.

       "  'data': 'Alternaria Leaf Spot\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms vary slightly depending on the variety of plant concerned. In seedling growing from infected seeds, the pathogens usually cause damping-off of the newly emerged plants. In older plants, dark-brown, circular spots with a concentric growth and well-defined borders develop first on older leaves. Over time, the center of these target-like spots become thin and papery, eventually dropping out to give a \"shot-hole\" aspect to the leaf. As the lesions expand and coalesce, leaves can be engulfed by dead tissues, leading to premature defoliation. Spots can also appear on mature pods, which show shriveled, smaller and discolored seeds with signs of decay. However, because the disease usually occur during the maturity of the plant, it causes minimal yield loss and requires no management recommendations.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological products are available against Alternaria leaf spot in soybean. Organic treatments include the use of fungicides based on copper (usually around 2.5 g/l).\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated disease management with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. This disease does not require specific management if it appears late in the season. Consider a fungicide application if infections occur early in the season and with favorable conditions for the growth of the fungus. In that case, products based on mancozeb, azoxystrobin or pyraclostrobin may be applied at the first sign of the symptoms. Do not delay treatment until a large outbreak is identified as it may be too late for successful control. Seeds treated with these fungicides are also effective to prevent the incidence of the disease.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nIn soybean, Alternaria leaf spot is caused by several fungi belonging to the genus Alternaria spp. These pathogens can break in the pod walls, infecting seeds and making them the main transmission route of the disease between seasons. The fungus can also overwinter on susceptible weeds or non-decomposed crop debris. The secondary spread between plants is mainly airborne and is facilitated by warm, humid weather with predominant winds and rain splashes. Provided leaf wetness is optimal, the fungus germinates within hours and enter the tissues through natural pores or through insect wounds. Optimal temperatures for the development of the disease are around 20-27°C. Plants are most susceptible at the seedling stage and late in the season when leaves are mature. The incidence may be important on soybean crops irrigated during the post-rainy season, and favored by added physiological or nutritional stress for the plant.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse high quality, healthy seeds, from certified sources if possible.\\nCheck if there are resistant varieties in your area.\\nLeave sufficient space between plants when planting to allow for a good ventilation.\\nMonitor fields regularly for signs of the disease, mostly when conditions are favorable for the disease.\\nRemove and collect infected plants, as well as neighboring surrounding plants.\\nRemove weeds in and around the field.\\nAvoid working in the field when foliage is wet.\\nDestroy crop residues from the field after harvest.\\nPlan a crop rotation with non-susceptible crops for a minimum of three years.'},\n",

The main symptoms show as yellow, wedge-shaped patches on the edge of leaves, later moving inwards onto the leaf and downwards into the stem. This symptom distinguishes black rot from Fusarium wilt, where symptoms move upwards from the ground level towards the stem. As the disease progresses, the yellowing part of the leaf enlarges and turns brown as the tissues die. Leaf veins turn black at the final stage of the disease, thereby the common name. Eventually, the leaf collapses. The pathogen may enter the stem and spread through the vascular system, something that is visible as a ring of black discolouration when cut near the soil surface.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nA hot water bath for 30 minutes at 50 °C is the recommended treatment to sterilize the seeding material. This is not 100 percent effective against black rot but reduces the incidence of the disease considerably. The drawback is that it might lower the germination rate.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and available biological treatments. Seed treatments with hot water are very effective in blocking the contamination of fields. Foliar treatments with copper-based fungicides every seven to ten days can also slow the spread of the disease. Unfortunately, these treatments can cause black spots to develop on the outer leaves of the cabbage.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the soil-borne bacterium Xanthomonas campestris, which survives in infected crop debris or seeds for up to 2 years, or on weeds of the Brassica family for longer periods. It affects a large number of vegetables in the cabbage family (including broccoli, cauliflower, turnip, radish, and kohlrabi). The bacterium spreads to healthy plants via water splashes and enters the tissues through different paths, among other injuries. Once a plant becomes infected, the disease spreads quickly to other cabbages. The first symptoms occur on the contaminated soils and seeds in the propagation bed. Environmental conditions favour the bacteria and the infection process are high humidity and temperature of 25 - 30 °C. Densely planted crops provide ideal conditions for bacterial spread to nearby plants. Under such conditions, crop yields can be reduced by 75 - 90%.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use healthy seeds from certified sources.\\nPlant resistant varieties and avoid growing susceptible ones in the rainy season.\\nDo not clip transplants because they are oversized.\\nProvide the fields with good drainage and plant on raised beds.\\nDo not grow cabbage in fields that had broccoli, cauliflower, kale or any other member of the Brassica family for the previous 3 years.\\nClean the field and surroundings from weeds, particularly those from the Brassica family.\\nAvoid using sprinkler irrigation and irrigate during the middle hours of the day.\\nDo not work on fields when they are wet to avoid disease transmission.\\nMonitor the fields for signs of the disease.\\nCut old leaves that are in contact with the ground diseased.\\nEnsure that the tools are clean and disinfect them with bleach.\\nPlough and bury crop debris after harvest or burn them.\\nControl cabbage worms and other insects that can cause injury to the plant.'},\n",

A layer of short fine hairs, varying in color from white to pinkish red, can be found in the cavities beneath these raised areas. The tiny and translucent mites are protected by these dense hair coatings. Later on, the swellings and the hair, that coat them inside, dry up and turn brownish. In some countries, these mites cause a different type of damage, for example distortion of basal leaves as well as deformation of buds and leaf curling.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe predatory mite Galendromus occidentalis feeds on blister mites and has been shown effective in reducing their numbers. Insecticidal soap or neem oil can also be used, but these could also reduce the populations of beneficial insects. Furthermore, treatments with wettable sulfur could be helpful.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatment if available. Spirotetramat has been used successfully against blister mites. Ensure that there is adequate foliage for absorption of the compound and allow 30 days between applications. Wettable sulfur could also be used.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe blister-like outgrowths on leaves are caused by Colomerus vitis. Despite the evident symptoms, it is not considered a major pest of grape. The tiny and sap-sucking mites affect predominantly grapevine. While feeding on the epidermis of the leaves they inject hormone-like substances into the cells that alter their growth, resulting in the characteristic swellings. The blister mite overwinters on the grape plant, for example hiding beneath bud scales. They become active in spring, when they move to the underside of young leaves and start feeding on them. At the end of the summer, they leave the foliage and seek refuge for the winter. The covering on the underside of leaves should not be wrongly identified with a fungal disease, such as mildew. The symptoms are more severe during rapid leaf growth in warm humid weather but the mite does not seem to have any harmful effect on fruit yields.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse healthy plants from a certified source.\\nMonitor the field regularly.\\nRemove, collect and destroy infested branches and plant parts as long as the infestation level is low.\\nControl the use of insecticides to avoid harming populations of beneficial insects.\\nAvoid spraying herbicides around grape plants as these are also harmful to beneficial insects such as predatory mites.'},\n",

Adding ferric chloride or mancozeb to cupric hydroxide provides good control of the strains that develop resistance over the years.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBacterial canker is a disease caused by two closely related bacteria that infect leaves and stems of plums, cherries and related Prunus species. These bacteria usually dwell on the surface of the leaves. During wet weather in spring or early summer, it can enter through the leaf natural pores, causing infections to develop in the young leaves. As the leaf matures, these infections are revealed as small patches of diseased tissue that gradually becomes necrotic. The ongoing expansion of the leaf leads to the tearing and fall of these dead patches. Cankers develop on shoots when the bacteria gain entry to the tissues through wounds or leaf scars at the time of leaf fall. Cankers remain more or less dormant through summer, when tissues are resistant, and during autumn and winter when temperatures are low. In spring, the bacterium resumes growth and infections spread rapidly, killing the bark.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nOnly use seeds or shoots from certified nurseries.\\nPlant resilient varieties, if available in the area.\\nChoose locations exposed to the wind to decrease humidity.\\nMonitor the orchard for symptoms of the disease on a regular basis.\\nAvoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers but still fertilize accordingly.\\nCut off all cankered areas down to the healthy wood.\\nPrune soon after the harvest so that wounds can heal better.\\nIn both cases, seal pruning wounds with an appropriate paint.\\nDestroy the affected tree material by burning or throwing it to a landfill.\"},\n",

Parasitoid wasps Cotesia sesamiae, C. flavipes and Trichogramma chilonis lay eggs into the larvae of spotted stemborer. Another wasp, Xanthopimpla stemmator, attacks the pest when it is in the pupal stage. Natural predators include earwigs and ants. They provide effective population control.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments. Pesticides treatments should be weighted against the potential yield loss and the damage to the biodiversity of the area. Insecticides based on deltamethrin or chlorantriniliprole applied in granular form in the whorl can provide control against spotted maize stem borers.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nAdult moths are light brown and have a wingspan of 20-25mm. The forewings are light brown with some darker patterns while the hindwings are white. Adults are active at night and rest on plants and plant debris during the day. Females lay creamy white eggs in batches of 10-80 eggs onto the surface of the leaf. Caterpillars have a reddish-brown head and a light brown body with darker stripes running longitudinally and dark spots along the back, hence the name. The range of host plants is wide and includes sorghum, millet and maize. Climate conditions significantly impact the moths' life cycle. Warm and relatively humid conditions are particularly favorable. The pest most commonly occurs in hot lowland areas, and seldom above altitudes of 1500 m.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nGrow tolerant plants, if available locally.\\nMonitor the field regularly to spot feeding damage.\\nIntercrop with legumes, or cowpea and molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora) to repel the spotted stem borer caterpillars.\\nMaintain an optimum plant density to deter the insect.\\nSow 2-3 rows of trap crops on all sides.\\nUse plant or pheromone traps around the field.\\nRemove plants with signs of infection early.\\nCheck for volunteer plants and alternative hosts and remove them.\\nPlant either earlier or later to avoid peak populations of the insect and peak feeding activity.\\nEnsure good fertilization to get vigorous plants but avoid excessive use of nitrogen that increases pest attack.\\nImplement wide crop rotation with non-host plants (for example cassava).\\nRemove and destroy all crop residues after harvest.\"},\n",

Gradually the brown, watery rot expands from the surface to the core of the fruit, forming a V-shaped pattern (cylindrical rot pattern around the core are typical of another disease of apple, bot rot). Engulfed by the decomposition, the decaying apple dries up and usually remains hanging on the branch, forming a so-called mummified fruit. On leaves, infections are characterized by small purple flecks that later enlarge to irregular necrotic areas. Severely affected leaves turn yellow and eventually shed.

The scale feeds on stems, leaves, green twigs and occasionally on fruits, normally near ground level. Direct damage is often not obvious until a large population develops. The feeding damage shows as leaf yellowing and, in severe cases, even defoliation. The honeydew produced by the scales may get infected by sooty mold, which will blacken leaves and fruits.

Brown soft scales are surprisingly difficult to control. Products containing malathion work well against this insect. Narrow oil range spray can be used to complement these treatments. Fungicides can be used to prevent the sooty mold from taking hold. In any case, broad-spectrum insecticides should be avoided, as they could disturb beneficial insects.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the brown soft scale, Coccus hesperidum. It is a common pest of citrus, particularly present in tropical and subtropical regions as well as in greenhouses. Peak season is from mid-summer to early fall. Males are mobile and resemble a two-winged wasp or fly, but are rarely seen. Females are oval, flattened and soft, attached on the underside of leaves. As they mature, they change their color from greenish to brown. They lay eggs in some kind of brood chamber.

Leaves display discoloration, ranging from white to reddish-brown, usually starting from the leaf tip. In severe alkaline conditions, the discoloration extends to the rest of the leaf blade and the leaves may wither, giving the plant a scorched appearance. Deformation is also evident in the form of leaf rolling. Strong alkaline soils also inhibit plant growth and tillering, resulting in stunted growth. In plants that reach the flowering stage, alkalinity delays flowering and causes whiteheads. Symptoms can be confused with nitrogen deficiency.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nAlkaline soils can be corrected by adding organic compost, waste hair or feathers, organic garbage, waste paper, rejected lemons or oranges to the ground. This ensures the incorporation of acidifying material (inorganic or organic material) into the soil. It is possible to acidify the soil by adding minerals like pyrite or cheaper aluminum sulfate. Add acidic materials like sulfur or peat moss to reduce the soil pH.\\nChemical Control\\nCorrection of soil alkalinity can be done in different ways, depending on the source of the problem. Soil amendments using gypsum are most commonly used to correct an excess of sodium in soils with poor lime content. To work effectively, this must be followed by drainage with large amounts of water to remove the sodium from the root zone. The soluble calcium in gypsum displaces the sodium ions and those are leached with the excess water. Soil sulfur or even concentrated sulfuric acid can be used instead of gypsum in soils with sufficient calcium carbonate. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) or fertilizations schemes based on urea are also used to reclaim alkali soils.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nAlkalinity refers to the presence of ions in the soil that gives it an elevated pH. It is a characteristic of clay soils, sodic or calcareous soils, with a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Alkalinity can damage plant roots and impair the ability of plants to absorb water and extract essential nutrients from the soil. Poor root growth development and impaired plant growth will result. Alkaline soils can limit the availability of essential nutrients to the plant and may result in phosphorus and zinc deficiencies, and even possibly iron deficiency and boron toxicity.

Please notify us if you know of any.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. There are no chemical control options available to control the incidence and occurrence of this disease.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by Xanthomonas vasicola pv. vasculorum, a bacterium that may overwinter in infected crop residues. It is spread to healthy plants via rain splash and wind during the early stages of growth. Infected crop residue can also spread between fields with field equipment, harvesters or stalk feeding. It can enter the plant tissues directly, without any previous wound. Infection can develop in the same fields over several years if susceptible plants are grown and no measures are taken. Favorable environmental conditions for disease development are high relative humidity, heavy rainfalls and prolonged leaf wetness. Overhead irrigation and irrigation during hot weather also appear to increase the incidence of the disease.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose resistant or tolerant plants if available.\\nMonitor fields for signs of the disease.\\nHold weeds and volunteer plants in check.\\nRemove crop debris from equipment when working between different fields.\\nRemove plant debris from field after harvest.\\nAlternatively, plow them into the soil.\\nHarvest infected fields last to avoid spreading to other fields.\\nPractice crop rotations with non-host crops, such as soybean or wheat.'},\n",

If attacked before fruit set, plants can loose their terminal bud, leading to stunted and branched growth. Feeding damage on young flowers can cause drying and blasting within 3-4 days. Small and medium-sized flowers are particularly prone to irreversible damage. If flowers develop at all, they often show wrinkled and distorted petals as well as black anthers. Feeding damage on bolls causes black spots on the outside and shrunken and stained seeds on the inside. Yield and quality may be seriously affected in case of severe infestation.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNatural predators can be used to contain the mirid population in an infested field. Damsel bugs, big eyed bugs, assassin bugs, ants and some spider species are known to feed on mirid bugs. Furthermore, treatments with diluted Neem oil and biological insecticides based on the fungus Beauveria bassiana can be used to limit their population. Start to use biological treatment immediately after detection of the pest.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Insecticides containing dimethoate, indoxacarb or fipronil are effective against mirid bugs and can be used to contain severe infestations.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by several species of mirid bugs, depending on the crop. In cotton, the culprits are Campylomma livida, also known as dimple bug (central and northern India) and several members of the Creontiades spp., in particular C. biseratense (southern India). Adults have an oval-shaped, flat body with a greenish-yellow to brown color. A characteristic triangle outlines the center of the back. Eggs are laid individually into leaf petioles and hatch after 4-5 days. Young nymphs can easily be confused with aphids because of size and shape. However, mirid bugs move much faster than aphids. The preferred temperature for C. livida is around 30-32°C. As temperatures deviate from that optimum, their life cycle is slowed down. Particularly hot temperatures above 35°C and heavy rainfalls can decrease the bug population drastically.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nAvoid close spacing of cotton plants at planting.\\nPlant alternate host plants like lucerne around cotton fields to attract these bugs away from your crops.\\nMonitor your plants frequently for signs of infestation.\\nControl insecticide use and do not spray broad-range insecticides in order not to affect beneficial insects.\\nRemove and burn plant waste and infested plants to avoid further spreading of the pest.'},\n",

Very small sunken spots of various colors appear on leaves, stems, flowers or fruits, often surrounded by a more or less marked yellow halo. On leaves, the spots later enlarge to form lesions and can cover a major part of the blades. They turn yellow and can shed prematurely leading to defoliation. Spots on fruits are brown to dark brown, first circular, then irregular as they expand. The fruit later softens and rot develops in the arils which turn dark gray or black but are not watery. Anthracnose also can attack twigs and branches and results in cankers, which are areas of sunken, infected tissue with swollen edges. The infection of the trunk can occasionally result in girdling and dieback.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nKnown biocontrol agents are competitive fungi Aspergillus flavus, Hypocrea rufa, Hyponectria tuberculariformis, and Nectriella muelleri.

A first preventive spray could be applied when flowering begins and the environmental conditions are favorable for the fungus. Then spray at 15-day intervals twice, if necessary. Active ingredients are propiconazole, mancozeb or a combination of mancozeb and tricyclazole. Only spray fungicides with an actual registration for pomegranate. It is important to follow the specified concentrations and to use fungicides with different mode of actions to prevent resistances.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Glomerella cingulata. It overwinters in infected plant residues on the soil surface or in mummified fruits. In spring its spores are spread via rain splashes or wind and infect neighboring twigs or plants. The most susceptible stages are the bloom and fruit development period. Injuries due to tree thorns, insects, and animals favor the infection process. Frequent rainfall, a high humidity (50-80%) and a temperature range of 25-30°C favor the life cycle of the fungus. However, it is usually inactive in the dry season. Even light infections can cause cosmetic damage to the fruit and shorten its storage life.

       "  'data': 'Apple Scab\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe first visible symptoms of apple scab appear in the spring in the form of minute, circular, olive-green spots on leaves, often along a main vein. As they enlarge, they become brownish-black and eventually coalesce to form large patches of necrotic tissue. Affected leaves are often deformed and fall off prematurely, leading to defoliation in case of heavy infections. On shoots, the infections causes blistering and cracking that can then provide entry for opportunistic pathogens. On the fruits, brown to dark brown circular areas appear on the surface. As they develop further, they often coalesce and become raised, hard and corky. This restricts the expansion of the fruit and leads to distortion and cracking of the skin that expose the flesh. Light attacks do not affect the fruit quality significantly. However, the scabs can expose the fruits to opportunistic pathogens and rots, reducing the storage capacity and the quality.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIf disease levels were high the previous season, liquid copper fungicides can be sprayed to impede the fungal growth on the tree during the winter season. Sulfur sprays are only partially effective against apple scab. However, solutions containing sulfur and pyrethrins are available for organic control of the disease during the growing season.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Protectant fungicides such as dodine, captan or dinathion can be sprayed around bud break to avoid the disease. Once scab has been detected, fungicides based on difenoconazole, myclobutanil or sulphur can be used to control the development of the fungus. Ensure scab fungicides from different chemical groups are used to avoid the development of resistance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nApple scab is a disease caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. It survives the winter mainly on infected leaves on the ground but also on bud scales or lesions on wood. At the onset of spring, the fungus resumes growth and starts to produce spores, which are later discharged and dispersed over long distances by the wind. These spores land on developing leaves and fruits and start a new infection. Outer parts of unopened fruit buds are highly susceptible to scab. However, as the fruit matures it becomes much less susceptible. Humid environment, wetting period of leaves or fruits are essential for the infection. Alternative hosts include shrubs of the genus Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Sorbus. All apple varieties are susceptible to scab, with Gala being more vulnerable.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse tolerant or resistant varieties.\\nMonitor orchards for signs of the disease.\\nPick up affected leaves, shoots and fruits.\\nRake all the fallen leaves from around your trees after harvest.\\nAlternatively, apply 5% urea to leaves in the autumn to enhance their decomposition and to obstruct the life cycle of the fungus.\\nExcessive leaf litter can can also be mowed to speed up the breakdown of tissues.\\nEnsure a pruning method that allow for more air circulation.\\nWater in the evening or early morning hours and avoid overhead irrigation.\\nAvoid getting foliage wet when watering.\\nApply lime after leaf drop to increase soil pH.\\nSpread a mulch under the trees, keeping it away from the trunk.'},\n",

The discoloration of the outer bark ranges from yellow, to red-brown, to gray or black depending on host species affected. The infected sections of the bark cave in and grow black, wart-like fungal fruit bodies that give a characteristic toad-skin aspect to the tree. On peach, cherry and plum, these cankers ooze gum. The multiplication of cankers on trunk, branches and twigs can reduce the vitality of the tree, cause branch dieback and even the death of the trees.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nOnce infection has occurred, the best treatment is to increase the vigor of the orchard thought the use of fortifiers and a good fertilization program. .\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

Together, they are often referred to as Cytospora cankers. At the beginning of the vegetation period, the spores are released by the wart-like fungal fruit bodies on trunk and branches and spread by rain to the healthy tissues. They enter the bark tissue with the help of threadlike structures of the fungus. The pathogens are exclusively wound parasites and need dead tissue to infect. They enter the wood via leaf scars, damage caused by hail or frost, as well as via mechanical injuries caused by pruning or other field practices. The fungus is an opportunistic pathogen that normally trees weakened by environmental stresses, for example temperature or moisture extremes. These pathogens can infect apple and stone fruit trees, and many other trees such as aspen, poplar, elm, willow, birch, maple, sycamore, oak.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resistant varieties to avoid the spreading of the disease.\\nMaintain a high hygiene standard in the preparation of the planting area.\\nSelect the site carefully when establishing new orchards.\\nIrrigate the orchard regularly and avoid flooding or drought periods.\\nFertilize the trees according to their needs.\\nRefrain from pruning during the main infection period.\\nSeal wounds of large cuts with fungicidal wound dressing.\\nAvoid stress such as drought, flooding of soil, and infection by other pathogens.\\nRemoving infected branches from the field.\\nSterilize the tools between cuts if possible.\\nUse windbreaks composed of non-host trees.\\nControl insects and rodents that cause serious damage to the trees.'},\n",

An appropriate use of insecticides has resulted in good control of the psyllid vectors and thus a limited spread of the disease. Injection of the antibiotic tetracycline into the trunk of the trees may result in a partial recovery but has to be repeated often to show effect. Tetracycline is phytotoxic and may have adverse effects on the environment. For these reasons, its use has decreased in recent years.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms of huanglongbing (HLB) are caused by the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. It is transmitted persistently by two psyllid vectors that are omnipresent in the citrus grooves, Diaphorina citri and Trioza erytreae. HLB can be acquired by both nymphs and adults, which can maintain and transmit the disease throughout their 3- to 4-month lifespan. Huanglongbing is systemic and has an incubation period of three months to several years before symptoms are visible. The disease can also be spread through grafting, even though with variable transmission rates. Seed transmission may also be possible. Other pathologies or disorders also show such a mottling of the leaves. It is thus recommended to send samples of tissues for analysis in laboratories to ascertain the cause.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nBe aware of possible quarantine regulations in the country.\\nMonitor the citrus groove regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nRemove affected trees immediately.\\nMaintain a thorough standard of hygiene among workers and tools involved in citrus growing.\\nRemove alternative hosts of the psyllids such as Murraya paniculata, Severinia buxifolia, and other plants in the same family as citrus (Rutaceae).'},\n",

The most obvious symptoms are rotting fruit and discolored tissue near and above the roots, also called ‘crown rot’. When the crown of the plant is infected, the whole plant may wilt. You can see discoloration by cutting open the crown of the infected plant. Fruit rot starts as light brown, water-soaked spots on ripening fruit, which turn into dark brown or black, hard injuries. Under humid conditions, orange-colored liquid may come out of the fruit injuries. Black injuries on buds and flowers and dried out flowers are an early sign of infection. Leaves may also have black spots and damages, but this alone does not mean the plant has anthracnose.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nLook for products that explicitly say they control the disease. These are made from helpful bacteria or fungi. These products work best when used before the disease starts.

It's very important to spray when the plants are at the stage of blooming. Do not wait until you see symptoms on the fruit before applying a treatment. Only use fungicides that are approved by the government. Change the type of fungicide you use to stop anthracnose from becoming resistant to the most effective fungicides. Read the label of the fungicides you choose and make sure you understand how they work, and follow the instructions and rules for using them. Some fungicide labels may also say that they can be used for dip applications at transplanting phase, which can provide further protection to your crop.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nAnthracnose is a fungal disease and one of the most damaging disease for strawberries. It can cause big losses throughout the growing season and after harvesting. The disease usually enters the fields through new strawberry transplants. The pathogen may be there but not show any signs until the temperature and humidity is good for it to grow. The disease grows best when there is warm and humid weather. When rain drops hit the ground, they can push soil particles into the air and spread the disease. This is especially true if it is windy. It has also been reported that the pathogen can survive in the soil and plant debris for up to nine months and can infect weeds growing near the field. Even the movement of machines and people through the field can spread the disease.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse healthy transplants and make sure to follow up with good cultural practices as it is sometimes hard to know if your transplants are really disease-free.\\nUse cultural practices that make sure the air can circulate around the crop and that the fruit dries quickly, both in the nursery and in the field.\\nCover exposed soil with straw mulch to stop the disease from spreading through water droplets.\\nAvoid plastic mulches which favor the spread of the disease.\\nUse bottom watering or drip irrigation instead of overhead watering.\\nApply fungicides, either conventional or organic, that work against anthracnose when the plants are blooming and if the weather conditions are favorable for the disease.\\nThese fungicides are used to keep the disease from building up, even if you don't see any symptoms.\\nPlant in soil that is free of old plant debris and make sure the soil is healthy by adding new organic matter.\\nTo make sure the soil is completely free of the disease, you can use methods like soil fumigation or heating the soil with the sun (solarization).\\nKeep the field free of weeds on a regular basis.\"},\n",

Longitudinal sections of the collar region show dark minute fungal bodies on the inner side of the bark and the internal tissue.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeed treatment with biocontrol agents like Trichoderma viride, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis has shown some benefits in managing the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Fungicide seed treatment with thiophanate methyl and vitavax reduced the incidence significantly. Treating the seeds with captan, thiram or benlate is also helpful in reducing the disease (usually 3g/kg of seeds)\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nIt is a soil-borne disease initiated by soil-borne fungal threads or spores of the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina. The symptoms appear suddenly when ambient temperature is between 25-30°C. By then, the fungus has colonized a good part of the plant tissues and gradually damaged them. With increasing temperature and more frequent moisture stress, M. phaseolina becomes more intense in typically tropical humid areas. High day temperature above 30°C and dry soil conditions at flowering and podding stages rapidly increase the severity of the disease. Overwintering fungal structures called sclerotia can persist in soils up to 6 years in some cases.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nSow early maturing varieties to avoid high temperatures during maturity, thereby reducing infection.\\nMonitor the field regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nA 3-year crop rotation can greatly reduce the overwintering structures in the soil.\\nPlow deeply and remove plant debris from the field and destroy them.\\nMaintain good soil moisture with irrigation from planting to pod fill but do not overwater.\\nAvoid high fertilization rates to reduce the incidence of the disease.'},\n",

Intercrop groundnut with Pennisetum glaucum to enhance the parasitoid Goniozus spp. on leaf miner.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Chemical sprays are only recommended when at least 5 larvae per plant at the seedling stage 30 days after emergence (DAE), or 10 larvae at flowering stage (50 DAE), and 15 larvae per plant at the pod filling stage (70 DAE) is noticed. Apply a chemical spray with dimethoate at 200-250 ml/ha (Chlorpyrifos @ 2.5 ml/l or Acephate @ 1.5 g/l) or Profenofos 20EC at 2 ml/l at between 30-45 days after sowing, if the pest populations are above the Economic Threshold Level.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage to the groundnut is caused by leaf miner larvae. The eggs of the leaf miner are shiny white and are laid singly on the lower side of the leaflets, while the larvae are light green or brown in colour with a dark head and prothorax. The adult leaf miner is a tiny moth that measures about 6 mm in length. Its wings are brownish-gray in colour. White dots also exist on each fore wing of the adult. The larvae mine the leaves and feed inside the leaflet. They come out of the mine after 5-6 days and migrate to adjacent leaves to feed and pupate in webbed leaves. Mined areas in the leaf become dry. The leaf miners are active both in rainy and post rainy seasons, and crop losses can vary from 25% to 75%.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse resistant varieties such as ICGV 87160 and NCAC 17090 that can give better yields in areas of high leaf miner incidence.\\nPlant early to escape late infestations.\\nIntercrop groundnut with trap crops such as pearl millet or cowpea.\\nUse light traps to attract moths during night hours, and to monitor pest populations.\\nRemove alternative hosts such as soybean and weeds such as lucerne, amaranthus, berseem and Indigofera hirsuta to control the growth of the pest.\\nPractice mulching with rice straw which causes a reduction in leaf miner incidence.\\nPractice crop rotation with crops like maize, cotton, and sorghum to give better yields and reduce the incidence of leaf miners.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Diamondback Moth\\n\\nSymptoms\\nDiamondback moth is usually considered a relatively insignificant pest. However, at high densities they can become troublesome to Brassica crops. The damage is caused by the larvae that dig tunnels in the leaf tissues or scrap the surface of the lower surface of the leaf blade. Irregular patches are visible (even though the upper leaf epidermis) can occasionally be left intact, creating a windowing effect. Older larvae are voracious and during severe infestations, the whole leaf can be eaten up, except the veins (leaf skeletonization). The presence of larvae on the florets can disrupt the formation of heads in broccoli or cauliflower.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nEnemies of the diamondback moth include the parasitic wasps Diadegma insulare, Oomyzus sokolowskii, Microplitis plutellae, Diadromus subtilicornis and Cotesia plutellae. Besides parasitoids, solutions containing entomopathogenic fungi or nuclear polyhedrosis virus can be used to control populations. Insecticide solutions containing Bacillus thuringiensis are also useful even though a rotation of products is recommended to avoid the development of resistance.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of both preventive measures together with biological treatments if necessary. Resistance to insecticides is widespread, and includes most classes of products (including some biological ones), so rotation of active ingredients is highly recommended. Products containing pyrethroids start to fail already after heavy usage in the decade of the 80s.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. Their main hosts belong to the Brassica family and include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, radish, and turnip as well as a number of weeds. Adults are small and slender, about 6 mm long and with pronounced antennae. Their body is dark brown with a characteristic light brown band along the back. They are not good fliers but can nevertheless be transported over long distances by the wind. Each female deposits on average 150 eggs under the leaf, usually in small groups of up to eight and close to the leaf veins. Young larvae have a leaf-mining feeding habit while older ones feed on the lower surface of the leaf, resulting in irregular patches. Rainfall has been identified as a major mortality factor for young larvae.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose resistant varieties such as mustard, turnip and kohlrabi.\\nChoose glossy varieties, lacking the normal waxy surface (green rather than grayish green), as they are more resistant to this pest.\\nMake sure that transplants are free of insects before planting.\\nMonitor fields for signs of damage or presence of larvae (threshold is 1 larva per every 3 plants or one hole per plant).\\nUse pheromone traps to catch adults and assess population numbers.\\nUse overhead sprinkle irrigation if possible as this mimics rainfall.\\nPlan an intercropping with suitable non-host crops.\\nPlan a crop rotation with crops from other families.\\nRemove and destroy crop waste after harvest.'},\n",

Sticky honeydew deposits accumulate on leaves and stems and usually develop black mould fungus, giving the foliage a sooty appearance. Ants may be attracted by the honeydew. The insects are most noticeable as groups of very small, black spiny lumps on leaf undersides. The combination of feeding damage and sooty mould growth weaken the trees and reduces fruiting.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nEncarsia Perplexa, Polaszek and Amitus hesperidum silvestri have been identified as parasitic wasps of Citrus Blackfly. The wasps are known to parasitize only the citrus black fly and closely related whiteflies, but will not harm plants and people. The insects such as ladybird, lacewing, Brumus sp., Scymnus sp. and Chlysoperla sp. are other natural enemies. Oils such as cotton oil and Fish Oil Rosin Soap (FORS) are effective and eco-friendly in nature not only to reduce the blackfly population but also reduces sooty moulds on leaves. Use neem seed extract spray (4%) to reduce the pest population.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Avoid the use of wide-spectrum pesticides to conserve natural enemies of A. woglumi. The insect can be controlled by fumigation of planting material or with chemical sprays. Spray curative pesticides when more than 50% of the eggs hatch and the younger ones are without any protective cuticle over their body. Quinalphos is found promising in reducing the population of citrus blackfly. Spraying must be done on the lower surface of the leaves where the pest thrives. The entire plant canopy should be drenched with the solution.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe citrus blackfly (Aleurocanthus woglumi) is a serious citrus pest of Asian origin and infests various host plants. It is a member of the whitefly family but the adult has a dark, slate blue appearance that led to it being given the name blackfly. The adult is a very sluggish tiny insect with limited flying range, but is active at dusk and rests on the lower leaf surface during the day. Females produce around 100 golden coloured eggs that are laid in spiral patterns on the lower side of the leaves. Thy nymphs are flattened, oval in shape and scale-like in their appearance. The cell sap is sucked from the leaves through the blackfly's piercing stylet. Simultaneously the fly secretes honeydew in large amounts. The optimal conditions for development are met at a temperature around 28-32°C and relative humidity of 70-80%. A. woglumi cannot survive in cold environments, where frost occurs.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use pest-free plants for your orchard.\\nCreate good conditions for air circulation within your orchard by avoiding close planting.\\nAdequate pruning and the removal of alternative hosts (weed and other host crops) will reduce suitable habitats for the blackfly.\\nMonitor your trees regularly for signs of the pest and sooty plant parts.\\nProvide adequate water and some fertilizer but avoid water logging or stress conditions to keep your citrus trees healthy.\\nExcessive irrigation and application of nitrogen, as well as pesticidal sprays, should be avoided.\\nRemove potential overwintering debris to reduce the chance of new infestation during the next growing season.\"},\n",

The disease occurs mainly after rains or when excess irrigation is given to fields. This results in the reduction of the functional leaf area. The disease cannot be transmitted through soil, seed cane and farming tools. It is mainly transmitted through airflow, wind, and rain. In dry weather, streak formation is rapid.

The center of the lesions later turn grayish and become speckled with minute dark dots. This feature allows to tell this disease from other types of blight. Severe infection will cause the premature shedding of leaflets and stem dieback at the growing points, giving the plants a blighted appearance. Another characteristic symptom of this disease is the discoloration of the seeds, with brown patches on the surface. Heavily infected seed is purplish-brown, shriveled and can be reduced in size. The discoloration of seeds reduces their quality and their market value.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nAs of today, no biological treatment seems to be available against this disease.

Pyraclostrobin or chlorothalonil can be used as protectant and are most effective when used preventively. Spraying at early flowering can help to prevent pod and seed infection.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungal pathogen Didymella fabae, that survives in previously infected plant residues or in seeds for several years. Infected seeds give rise to diseased seedlings with poor growth. Spores produced on quality and their residues are an important source of inoculum and are spread to the lower part of plants via rain splashes. The dark specks observed on the lesions are also spore-producing structures, and those are also spread to other crops via rain. Frequent rain showers and prolonged periods of leaf wetness (particularly in spring) favor the infection process and the development of the disease. Wet conditions late in the season provide ideal conditions for pod and seed nfection.

It is not seed- or soil-borne and thus needs green living tissue to survive. During the season, the spores produced in the pustules of cotton infect gramma grasses (Bouteloua spp.) around the fields and produce elongate brownish or black spots on their leaves.

       "  'data': 'Mango Midge\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms appear predominantly on the leaves, but occasionally also on the buds, inflorescences and young fruits of mango trees. The parts infested by this midge become covered with many small, raised galls or blisters. Each wart-like blister or gall is 3-4 mm in size and contains a yellow larva that feeds on tree tissue. In the early stages, the site of egg deposition appears as a small red spot. Heavily-affected leaves may deform, show reduced photosynthesis, and drop prematurely. Infested inflorescences may be unable to open. The small exit holes on the underside of leaves are remnants due to larval presence. These exit lesions may result in secondary fungal infections. Young fruits also display exit holes at the base of the stem. Severely infected mango shoots have almost no inflorescence, which can considerably reduce the yield.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe fall webworm, Tetrastichus sp. parasitizes on the larvae of Procontarinia sp. and hence can be used to control the pest. Other parasitoids are of the family Platygaster sp., Aprostocetus spp., and Systasis dasyneurae. Apply neem seed kernel extract on the tree canopy.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Excessive use of insecticides may cause resistance and kill natural enemies. Spraying of 0.05% fenitrothion at bud burst stage of the inflorescence can be effective in controlling the pest. Foliar application of bifenthrin (70ml/100lit) mixed with water has also given satisfactory results. The spraying should be repeated at 7-10 day intervals in the flowering season until the fruits reach pea-size.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by different species of midges, Procontarinia sp. Adult midges are 1-2 mm in size and die within 24 hours of emergence after copulation and egg deposition. Eggs are laid on almost all tree parts, but they are predominantly found on leaves. When they hatch, the larvae penetrate the tissues and inflict damage depending on the organ they affect. Floral parts that are fed upon can consequently dry up and fall to the ground due to extensive feeding. Mature larvae migrate or fall onto the upper soil layers, where they enter the pupal stage. The emergence of adults usually takes place in the afternoon and is favored by cool temperatures (20°C) and 60-82% relative humidity. There can be up to 3-4 pest generations over the period of January to March in the northern hemisphere.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCultivate tolerant or resistant tree varieties.\\nMonitor fields regularly for signs of infestation with midges.\\nHand-pick the insect, especially if the population is not dense.\\nMake sure to maintain the field free of debris and broken branches.\\nRemove weeds in and around the fields regularly.\\nPrune infested branches during the season.\\nPlant an intercrop in your mango orchard to reduce population levels.\\nUse yellow sticky traps to catch the flies.\\nCover the soil with plastic foil to prevent larvae from dropping to the ground or pupae from coming out of their nest.\\nPlow the soil regularly to expose pupae and larvae to the sun, which kills them.\\nCollect and burn infested tree material during the season.\\nDo not transport infested plants or fruits to new areas or markets.'},\n",

In most cases, leaf margins turn red first and the discoloration later spreads to the rest of the blade. Other symptoms may include wilting, reddening of stems, poor or no boll development, leaf and fruit shed and stunted plants. During senescence, the discoloration is a natural process that can usually be observed throughout the whole field. Besides nitrogen deficiencies, leaf reddening can also be caused by overexposure to direct sunlight, cold temperatures and wind damage. In that case, the discoloration affects single leaves rather than the whole field.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDepending on stress and growth stage, the application of organic fertilizers can be beneficial for the plant. Biological control is not necessary if the leaf reddening starts late in the season or if the process is triggered by physical factors.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. There is no chemical control available for leaf reddening in cotton crops. A good supply of farmyard manure, a judicious irrigation program and balanced fertilization will help to avoid the problem. If happening early in the season, amendments with nutrients may help to solve the problem. If symptoms start around the same time as the opening of the first bolls, no measures need to be taken.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms can be caused by several abiotic factors such as water, continuous temperature stress or soil poor fertility. Some varieties or hybrids are more susceptible than others. The reddening is due to the increase in a red pigment called anthocyanin and a decrease in the green pigment chlorophyll in leaves. A cause can be the death of rootlets that reduces the ability of the plant to actively take up water and nutrients. During senescence, this process is natural and has no negative effect on the yield. Other causes early in the season may be the deficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (magnesium does not seem to be involved). Furthermore, overexposure to sunlight, wind and cold temperatures can also trigger discoloration.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant at the recommended time to avoid high soil temperatures during fruiting.\\nCheck the best distance between plants.\\nUse cotton varieties resistant to abiotic stress.\\nMake sure to have an adequate manuring of the soil.\\nProtect the crops from physiological stress like direct wind damage.\\nPlan a judicious irrigation according to the plant's needs.\\nMonitor soil nutrients and apply balanced nutrient management practices.\\nAfter harvest plow deep to mix soil.\"},\n",

The disease typically develops late in the season and during storage. Diseased kernels with white, pinkish-colored mold are interspersed amid healthy-looking ones. The kernels may also show discoloration. They might turn tan or brown. The discoloration follows a radial pattern from the top of the kernel. If conditions are favorable for the development of the disease (warm and dry weather, presence of pests), ears may be completely colonized by the fungus and show abundant fungal growth. The entire ear appears withered and the kernel might be completely consumed. Grain yield is reduced. The fungus produces toxins, making the ear inedible.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSolutions based on the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens can be used as seed treatment and as spray to reduce the incidence of the disease, and the production of toxins\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatmetns if available. Fungicides applied early in the season can limit ear infection. Since the damage occurs in the ears, fungicides are not the most effective way to fight the disease. Consider controlling insect pests that injure the ears and favor the growth of the fungus. Products containing propiconazole 1 ml/l can be used at the time of grain hardening stage to control the fungus.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused mainly by the fungus Fusarium verticillioides, but other species of Fusarium can trigger the same symptoms. It survives on seeds, crop residues or on alternative hosts such as grasses. Spores are mainly transported by wind. It enters the corn ears primarily through wounds from hail or feeding damage from insects and birds, or injuries during field work. It germinates and gradually colonizes the kernels from the entry points. Alternatively, it can start to colonize the plant from the roots and move up the plant through systemic growth. Plants can get infected under a wide range of environmental conditions, but the symptoms become particularly severe when the weather is warm and dry and the plants have reached the flowering stage. It is the most common mold in maize.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse tolerant or resistant varieties available in your market.\\nSow plants that are adapted to local weather conditions.\\nAvoid planting too densely in the field.\\nEnsure a good fertilization during later stages of plant growth.\\nClean infected grains or store them separately to avoid production of toxins.\\nClean your storage facilities thoroughly.\\nFollow weather forecasting information before harvesting the crop to avoid over wetting of the produce on threshing floor.\\nMake sure not to injure the cobs during harvest.\\nStore grains in low humidities and low temperatures.\\nPlow and bury crop residues after harvest.\\nRotate with non-host plants for at least one year.'},\n",

The first sign is usually the discoloration and thickening of young leaves. Yellowing may be uniform, or diffusely interveinal, fading gradually with distance from the main veins. Leaves and stems near the shoot tip are brittle and break easily when bent. Leaves may become puckered (slightly raised in interveinal zones) and the tip and lateral lobes may curl down. In some cases, the leaf veins may appear thickened and raised and petioles may twist. Internodes may be shortened, producing a higher density of leaves near the apex. At greater severity, the deficiency causes necrosis of the growing points. Storage roots are often short and blunt-ended and may split as the deficiency progresses.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nMake sure to have healthy soils with good organic matter content and a good water retention capacity by applying farm manure.\\nChemical Control\\nUse fertilizers containing boron (B).\\nExample: disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (Boron 20%) for foliar spray.\\nConsult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.\\nFurther recommendations:\\nIt is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.\\nIt is better to apply boron to the soil because foliar sprays can damage leaves on many crops.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBoron deficiency is usually observed in soils with a high pH because in these conditions this element is in a chemical form that is not available for the plant. Soils with low organic matter content (<1.5%) or sandy soils (prone to nutrient leaching) are also susceptible to boron deficiency. The application of boron may not correct the deficiency in those cases because it may remain unavailable for plant absorption. Symptoms on foliage might resemble those of other pathologies: false spider mite, zinc deficiency or mild iron deficiency. On storage roots, blister-like bumps and cracking can also be symptoms of root-knot nematode or rapid changes in soil moisture.

If infested during the vegetative state, they bore through the terminal buds of the shoots and move downward. This causes drying and shedding of terminal shoots before flowering. If the main stem is affected, the whole plant might collapse. When attacked in a later stage, the larvae will bore holes at the base of buds and bolls to feed inside. The tunnel entrance is often blocked by excrement. Damaged flower buds sometimes spread prematurely and so-called flared squares can be observed. Damage to the plant tissue can lead to fungal or bacterial infections. The younger the plant, the more damage the spotted bollworm can cause.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nScouting for eggs or small larvae is essential in the management of this pest. Some parasitoid insects of the family Braconidae, Scelionidae and Trichogrammatidae can be used as a biological control method. Also try predatory insects from the following orders: Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Neuroptera. Make sure to promote these species (or even introduce them to the field), and avoid the use of broad-scale pesticides. You can apply bioinsecticide sprays containing Bacillus thuringiensis to control population peaks. Spray Neem seed kernel extracts (NSKE) 5% or Neem oil (1500ppm) @ 5ml/l.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Treatment is recommended when 10 eggs or five small worms per 100 plants are present during early bloom. As larvae become increasingly resilient to insecticidal treatment while growing, scouting for eggs and young larvae is crucial. Treatment is recommended to be applied during the egg stage. Insecticides containing chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, flubendiamide, or esfenvalerate can be applied. Chemical treatment may be inviable in low-value crops.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of the spiny bollworm, Earias insulana, a common pest in the northern regions of India. Alternative host plants for this pest are, among others, hibiscus and okra. The moths are silver-green to yellow in color, approximately 2 cm long and can be seen on flowers or close to light sources. Three darker streaks can be seen on the wings. Green forms are common during summer while yellow and brownish colors appear in fall. Eggs are of blue in color, singly laid on young shoots, leaves, and squares. The young larvae are light brown with grey to yellow and orange features. They can be best distinguished from most other caterpillars by the tiny spines, visible under a hand lens, that cover most of the body surface. As they reach maturity, they pupate in a silken cocoon attached to leaves or fallen plant parts. Under tropic conditions, a generation is complete within 20-25 days. Low temperatures can delay the process to a length of up to two months.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resilient varieties, if available in your area.\\nAvoid monocultures and implement intercropping with beneficial plants.\\nEnsure early planting to avoid peak populations.\\nProvide uncultivated marginal areas to break life cycle or plant trap crops like hibiscus and okra.\\nLeave sufficient distance between plants.\\nMonitor the cotton field regularly for larvae and eggs of the spiny bollworm.\\nKeep up a sufficient fertilization.\\nPromote an early harvest.\\nClear all harvest residues after each cropping cycle.\\nPlow deeply to expose pupae to predators and elements.'},\n",

Looking forward hearing from you.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Greasy spot is usually controlled with a one or two well-timed applications of petroleum oil during the summer months. This reduces the penetration of the spores into the leaves and fruits and thus delays the appearance of symptoms, even when the pathogen has already colonized the leaf. Products containing copper or copper sulfate are normally added to the oil to achieve a successful control of leaf and fruit symptoms. Other fungicides have also been used previously (for example strobilurins) but have lead in some cases to the development of resistance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella citri, which survives in crop debris on the soil surface when no suitable crop is available. In the spring, when conditions are favorable, the fungus produces spores that are released by rain splashes, overhead irrigation or heavy dew. Wind can also transport them to other citrus groves. Once they land onto the lower side of a leaf, they germinate and the fungi slowly penetrate the tissues through the natural pores on the blade. This process is also favored by elevated temperatures, high humidity and prolonged leaf moisture. Several months can pass between the primary infection during the summer and the appearance of the first symptoms in winter. By contrast, cool temperatures and dry weather result in lower spore number and less infection. Leaves remain susceptible to infection throughout the growth stages of the tree if environmental conditions are favorable. The presence of rust mites on trees has also been associated with the disease.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nDo not plant citrus in fields with history of greasy spots.\\nMonitor the field for any sign of the disease, for example canopy density and leaf drop.\\nDo not use overhead irrigation.\\nKeep the field clear of crop debris, fallen leaves and fruits.\\nApply lime and extra irrigation after harvest to accelerate leaf decomposition on the ground.\\nAlternatively, apply urea to retard the growth of the fungi.\"},\n",

Usually, symptoms are confused with bird damage.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPromote predator species like spiders, lacewings, ants and other natural enemies by avoiding the use of pesticides. Release Trichogramma chilonis at weekly intervals @ 1.5 lakh/ha for four weeks. Bio-insecticides based on NPV (Nucleopolyhedrovirus), Bacillus thuringiensis or Beauveria bassiana can also help to control semiloopers. Botanical products, such as neem extract and chilli or garlic extract can be sprayed on the foliage to control the pest. Apply NPV 250 LE/ha with Teepol 0.1% and Jaggery 0.5% thrice at 10-15 days interval commencing from the flowering stage. Apply Neem oil or Pungum oil 80 EC @ 2ml/lit.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments. If more than 2 larvae are found per 10 plants, control measures must be started. Chlorpyriphos and Quinalphos are suggested to reduce semilooper population.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of Autographa nigrisigna. The moth of the semilooper has patterned fore wings. The eggs are spherical and are laid in clumps of 40 eggs on the leaflets. The larvae and semilooper are green in colour. One generation takes about 4 weeks to develop. Egg period takes about 3-6 days and the larval period is completed in 8-30 days, while the pupal period occupies 5-10 days.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose a tolerant variety.\\nAvoid close plant spacing and late planting.\\nTry to grow large and vital plants with a good fertilization and irrigation scheme.\\nMonitor your plants at weekly intervals and check for the presence of larvae.\\nLight and pheromone traps can be installed to check and kill the moth population.\\nOne light trap should be installed per 2 ha whereas pheromone traps are installed at a distance of 50 m @ 5 traps/ha.\\nYou can also install bird perches for predatory birds @ 50/ha.\\nGrow tall sorghum as a comparison crop to serve as biological bird perches.\\nCollect and destroy larvae and adults to the extent possible.\\nPlough your field after harvest to make the pest accessible to predators.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Great Southern White\\n\\nSymptoms\\nA clear sign of an infestation is when plant leaves are damaged by feeding. The caterpillars of the Great Southern White butterfly are the one doing the damage. Usually they eat the edges of the leaves, starting from the outer parts and moving inward. This kind of feeding often creates uneven holes along the edges of the leaves. The caterpillars are capable of eating the entire plant parts above the ground. They are voracious eaters of cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli). Keep an eye out for clusters of eggs on the top side of the leaves and caterpillars feeding together in groups. You may also spot adult moths in the field.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nConsider using Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spray, a natural insecticide that targets and kills cabbage worm larvae while being safe for humans and beneficial insects. Apply neem oil spray, derived from the neem tree, as a natural repellent and insecticide.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological/environment friendly treatments. According to literature most of the following insecticides efficiently controlled Ascia monuste, but not all of them are safe for natural enemies: Chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, indoxacarb, spinosad, chlorfenapyr. Additionally, the use of pesticides can lead to cases of resistance, where pests become less affected by the insecticides over time.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the caterpillars of the insect Ascia monuste. It is a very harmful pest that causes significant losses in cruciferous crops. Female adults lay groups of yellow, spindle-shaped eggs on the top side of leaves. This happens between November and May, which is the warm and rainy season in tropical areas. The caterpillars are yellow with gray stripes. The stripes run along their bodies and they have small black spots. The adult butterflies are white (males) and dirty white to gray (females). The adults live for about 19 days. They will travel long distances to find food, mates, and good conditions for those in juveniles stages to grow. Studies have shown that these pests do best in wet and warm conditions with temperatures ranging from 16 to 35 °C. Yet cold weather and heavy rainfall make it difficult for them to survive.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUsing resistant cultivars or varieties, if available.\\nPlant purple or red cabbage varieties, as they are less appealing to cabbage worms and moths.\\nMonitor plants regularly for signs of infestation, such as feeding damage and groups of eggs.\\nRemove eggs manually when found. Preserve biodiversity by protecting habitats for natural enemies of the moth, such as predatory insects and birds.\\nUse floating row covers, preventing these pests from reaching your plants.\\nUse polyculture and companion planting by interplanting with herbs like thyme, sage, and rosemary, as well as marigolds and nasturtium.\\nHang decoy moth traps to capture male moths and disrupt their reproduction.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Root Rot of Cotton\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe wilting of cotton plants is the first visible symptom of this disease and in severe cases complete defoliation or collapse may happen as a result. The rapid development of the wilting is characteristic, a feature that can be used to differentiate root rot from other pathologies causing this symptom. In the beginning, only a few plants in the field are affected, but over time, the disease spreads in a circular manner around these plants throughout the field. The wilting taking place above ground is actually a late manifestation of the disease, a sign of the rotting of the roots and the poor transport of water and nutrients to the aerial parts of the plant. Eventually, the affected plants lose stability and are easily dislodged by wind or can easily be pulled out of the ground. The bark of roots takes a yellowish appearance compared to healthy plants and is often broken into shards.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo this day, no biological agent is known to provide efficient control against cotton root rot. Some species of the fungus Trichoderma showed promising results in that they significantly increased the survival of treated cotton seedlings and are being considered for commercialization. Some organic formulations of zinc sulphate can be sprayed to limit its spread.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Seed or soil treatments with various formulations containing the fungicides thiram, thiophanate methyl, zinc sulphate and captan are effective in controlling the incidence of root rot.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the seed and soil-borne fungus, Macrophomina phaseolina. It is an important and widely prevalent disease of cotton all over the world. It can also affect a broad range of about 300 different hosts, among others pepper, melon or cucumber. This pathogen survives in soils and it can easily be isolated in the roots of cotton, particularly during the late period of the growing season. The fungus thrives in soils when plants experience drought, and the disease occurs most frequently in mid-summer and decreases until autumn sets in. Dry soils, with moistures of 15-20 percent, and hot temperatures between 35 and 39 °C are optimal conditions for the fungus.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nGrow varieties tolerant to the fungus or to drought.\\nPlant varieties with stronger stems that will not dislodge.\\nAdjust the sowing date so that the post-flowering stage is not in the driest part of the growing season.\\nUse wider spacing between the plants.\\nMaintain good soil moisture through irrigation, especially during the post-flowering period.\\nEnsure balanced fertilization and avoid excessive nitrogen use.\\nHarvest early to avoid major yield losses.\\nPlow deep to bury crop residues.\\nSolarization of soil residues after tillage may also be effective.\\nRotate with non-host crops such as small wheat, oats, rice, barley and rye for three years.'},\n",

The fungus infects plants through the roots or crowns and then grows systemically within the plant through the stem. If they survive the first stages of the infection, the seedlings develop into abnormally tall plants (often several inches) with pale, thin and dry leaves, and with fewer tillers. The inner side of the stem becomes rotten and new roots develop from the upper nodes of the stem. Brown spots develop on the stem of infected plants. If the plants survive to maturity stage, they develop partially-filled, sterile, or empty grains. In those plants, the flag leaf is noticeable by its elevated and more horizontal orientation.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological treatment against this disease is known to this day. Salt water can be used to separate lightweight (infected) seeds from healthy ones during soaking.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Soaking seeds in a fungicide solution containing triflumizole, propiconazole, prochloraz (alone or in combination with thiram) for five hours has been shown to be useful. Seed treatment with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is also effective at reducing the incidence of this disease. Spraying of the compounds above during vegetative stage for two times at weekly intervals also helps to control the disease.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBakanae is a seedborne fungal disease. The disease occurs most frequently when infested seeds (i.e., seeds covered in fungal spores) are used, but also can occur when the pathogen is present on plant material or in the soil. It spreads through wind or water that carries the fungal spores from one plant to another. Bakanae can also be transmitted during farm operations, such as harvesting infected plants allowing fungal spores to spread to the healthy seeds, and soaking seeds in water that contains the fungus. High temperatures of 30 to 35°C favour the development of the disease.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse clean seeds to minimize the occurrence of the disease.\\nCheck the resistant varieties available.\\nMonitor your seedlings and avoid planting palish, albino plants.\\nAvoid over-fertilization with nitrogen-rich fertilizers.\\nDeep plowing of fields before planting helps to expose the soil to UV light.\\nDestroy the stubbles of the previous crop by plowing before sowing.'},\n",

These symptoms include water-soaked patches on the lower side of cotyledons and, occasionally, damping-off. On older plants, dark or reddish-brown, angular lesions form along the veins of leaves. Symptoms on the fruit typically develop just prior to maturity, and appear first as small, olive-colored, irregular lesions on the surface. These lesions can rapidly expand and grow together, coalescing into a large dark-green blotches. As the disease progresses, cracks form in the lesion area, and an amber-colored liquid oozes out of the tissue. Opportunistic pathogens colonize the damaged tissues, leading to the rotting of the fruit from within.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeed can be cleaned using a dry heat treatment to remove the pathogen with some success.

Applications should start at or before flowering and continue until fruits are mature.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the bacterium Acidovorax citrulli, which survives in and on seeds from infected fruit, in plant debris in the soil, and on alternative hosts such as weeds of the cucurbit family or volunteer plants. All cucurbits are susceptible to the disease to a certain degree but there are differences in the severity of the symptoms. Infected seeds are thought to be the most important factor in the primary dispersion of the disease. Secondary infection from plant to plant takes place through splashing water (rain or overhead irrigation), on the hands and clothing of workers, and on tools and equipment. Infection and disease are favored by high temperatures (above 32°C) and high relative humidity (above 70%). Fruit can become infected through the pollination of flowers and up to 2-3 weeks after flowering. But as the fruit matures, it develops a waxy layer on its surface that inhibits further infection.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nBe aware of possible quarantine regulation in your country.\\nOnly use seeds from certified sources.\\nMake sure to maintain a high standard of hygiene throughout the entire growing cycle.\\nMonitor the crop regularly for symptoms of the disease and destroy infected plants immediately.\\nWeeds of the cucurbits family and alternative hosts should be avoided.\\nPlant debris should be plowed deep in the soil after harvest.\\nPlan a 3 year crop rotation to avoid the spread of the bacterium.\\nAny equipment used in a infected field should be thoroughly cleaned before further use.'},\n",

In any case, main symptoms are visible on leaves and stems. Leaf lesions include both circular, pale grayish lesions dotted with black specks, and dark necrotic lesions. A yellow discoloration of the leaf vein or of whole patches surrounding the lesions is also common (chlorotic halo). Stems also show grayish lesion that can range from small, oblong, brownish spots to cankers that girdle the whole stem. Blackish specks can also be observed on them. As they grow, the cankers girdle the stem and weaken it, leading to early ripening, lodging and plant death. Pods may show symptoms in the form of brown lesions with a black margin, resulting in premature ripening and seed infection.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological control measures seem to be available to fight these disease. Please contact us if you know of any.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Fungicides have very little effect once the fungus has reached the stem and treatment are only justified in fields where high yields are expected. Prothioconazole can be used as foliar spray. An active seed treatment with prochloraz added to thiram can reduce seedling infections caused by seed-borne Phoma infection.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBlackleg (also known as Phoma stem canker) is actually caused by two species of fungi, namely Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa. They overwinter in seeds, or in stubbles and crop debris that remain in the field. They begin to produce spores during the onset of warm and humid weather in spring. These spores are dispersed by the wind or splashing rain to healthy plant parts, mainly lower leaves and the base of the stem. The germination of the spore and the growth of the fungus on the plant tissues trigger the appearance of symptoms. If the cotyledons are infected, seedlings may die early in the season (damping-off). The fungus spreads from the young leaves to the stem, where it grows forming cankers at the junction between petiole and stem or around the crown. This restricts water and nutrient transport to through the stem, and death and lodging may ensue. It is an important disease on rapeseed and other crops of the Brassica family (canola, turnip, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage).\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nThe most important measure against this disease is to use resistant varieties, if available for the crop of choice.\\nPlan a crop rotation with non-host plants.\\nPlow and bury crop debris after harvest.\\nSuperficial tillage can hinder the fungus to reach the lower leaves and stems.'},\n",

The disease is initially characterized by darkened roots and stem tissue and typically chlorotic lower leaves. If plants survive this stage, they grow poorly or not at all, and display black lesions in the roots, that later extend towards the crown tissue. Dark fungal growth may become visible along the root tissue. In high rainfall areas and in irrigated fields, the disease may result in the formation of large patches of numerous white-headed wheat plants. Plants can be pulled easily from the soil because of the severe rotting of the roots, which are almost black at this stage. Infected plants produce pinched grains, which are often not worth harvesting.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nVarious bacteria of the family Pseudomonas are able to effectively suppress the pathogen. They produce the antibiotics and compete for essential nutrients like iron. Bacteria producing phenazine or 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol have been proven effective against take-all disease as well. Antagonistic fungi strains can also be used, e.g. the non-pathogenic Gaeumannomyces graminis variant graminis.

Fungicides containing silthiofam and fluquinconazole can be used to decimate G. graminis. Application of sterol-inhibiting fungicides and strobilurin may also be effective in suppressing take-all symptoms.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis. Between seasons it survives in crop debris or in the soil. It infects roots of living hosts and as the root dies, it colonizes the dying tissue, feeding on it. It thrives when there are relatively short periods (weeks or a few months) between harvest and the sowing of new plants. Spores can be transported by wind, water, animals, and farm tools or machinery. The pathogen is relatively sensitive to competitors, and does not coexist well with native soil microorganisms. It is also sensitive to inactivation by heat.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resistant varieties, if available.\\nIn warm, wet climates only plant wheat every other year, in cold climates every third year.\\nAlternation with rice every second year can kill the pathogen through flooding.\\nDelay seeding of new wheat by a couple of weeks after harvesting the previous crop.\\nTill the soil carefully to increase microbial pressure from other organisms.\\nFertilize sufficiently, especially concerning phosphorus, manganese, zinc and nitrogen.\\nEnsure good drainage of the fields.'},\n",

After mating, the female deposits overwintering eggs on the bark, in bark crevices or under bark scales. These eggs hatch when temperatures average around 12-13ºC. The newly hatched caterpillars migrate up the tree trunks and wriggle between the scales of newly emerging buds.

These wounds are a perfect gateway for opportunistic pathogens that further worsen the symptoms. The occurrence of dead seedlings and hollowed-out seeds soon after planting are telltale signs of an infestation of the soil by this pest. At later stages of plant growth, young plants may wilt and show signs of discoloration. Central leaves may have feeding damage or die while the outer leaves remain green. Stems may be shredded but still attached to the roots. In the field, patches with thin stands or simply bare plants are common. Most of the damage is done during early spring. In potato, wireworms can burrow into potato seed pieces in the spring and into developing tubers in the fall.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSome ground beetles and rove beetles will feed on wireworms. Larvae of stiletto flies (Therevidae) are also predators of wireworms. Some species of nematodes will also feed on wireworms. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae seems to infect and kill wireworms. A granular formulation containing this fungus is being tested to determine its potential as a control measure for wireworms.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Prevention of wireworm damage requires treatment before or at planting time. Seed treatments with insecticides can be used to get some degree of control of their populations. Be aware of the restrictions of use of some of these products in your country.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the immature larval stage of a group of click beetles (Elateridae). Wireworms can be up to about 2 cm long, have slender, cylindrical bodies and are white, yellowish, or coppery in color. Females lay several hundred eggs singly among the soil particles during the summer. Loose and sandy soils favor their proliferation. The larvae feed on underground plant parts, germinating seeds or young seedlings for 2 to 3 years before reaching maturity. This often results in thin crop stands and lower yields. Beside wheat, they also attack maize, grasses and some vegetables (potato, carrots, onions). Crop damage is usually detected after planting, when it is too late to take effective measures. This makes scouting for wireworms essential prior to planting.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant less susceptible varieties if available.\\nMake sure to scout the field regularly and thoroughly prior to planting as this measure is essential to fight this pest.\\nBait traps or balls methods can be used to catch wireworms and monitor their numbers.\\nAvoid to plant potatoes in a field with a potential infestation with wireworms.\\nSow seeds into warm and moist soil to promote quick germination.'},\n",

This is generally confined to a single branch initially, but can spread to other part of the tree over time. At later stages of the disease, leaves split and may turn brown around the margins and the mid-rib. Internal tissues of affected stems turn dark brown under the bark and eventually die back. From late summer onwards, flat or bracket-shaped fungi develop on the bark of dead branches. They have a whitish woolly upper surface and a purple-brown lower surface. Both sides have spore-forming bodies and are soft and slippery when wet, brittle and shriveled when dry.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIn many cases, the trees will recover naturally from an attack of silver leaf, so it is recommended to wait some time before taking action.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. In susceptible trees in areas where silver leaf is a recurring problem, the treatment of pruning cuts with paints is recommended as a standard practice. However, some specialists claim that the best thing is to let these wounds heal naturally.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Chondrostereum purpureum, which build conspicuous fruiting bodies on the trunks and dead branches. These structures yield spores that are later released and transported by the wind to healthy trees and shrubs. They enter the tissues through wounds, mainly caused by pruning. As they grow down into the wood, they slowly kill it, producing a characteristic dark stain of the internal tissues. They also secrete a toxin that is carried up to the leaves through the sap stream. This toxin damages tissues and causes them to separate, conferring them the silvery aspect. So, even though the fungus is not actually present in the leaves, it can kill the leaves and branches. New fruiting bodies later appear on the dead wood and the cycle starts again. Drizzly, rainy, foggy or humid days with no wind or sun provide the perfect conditions for spore release and infection.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nOnly work with clean, disinfected tools.\\nProtect trees from unnecessary injuries.\\nMonitor the orchard regularly.\\nRoutine pruning in late spring or summer avoids the main infection phase.\\nAvoid pruning during wet weather conditions, which favor infection.\\nCover wounds with wound dressing to avoid the germination of spores.\\nDispose of the pruned material (burning or burying) immediately, as fruiting bodies form continuously.\\nMake sure to exclude alternative hosts like willows and poplars from and around the orchard.'},\n",

These lesions may have a sooty mass of spores in their centers and be surrounded by a chlorotic halo. Over time, the centers become thin and papery, eventually dropping out to give a \"shot-hole\" aspect to the lamina. Leaves become chlorotic and defoliation can ensue in severe cases.

These include: anilazin, chlorothalonil, difenoconazole, iprodione, mancozeb, maneb.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms vary slightly depending on the crop in question and are caused by the seed-borne fungus Alternaria brassicae, a common pathogen of cabbage and other species of Brassica. Another related species of fungus, namely Alternaria brassicola, may also be encountered in some of these crops. The main way of transmission of these pathogens is through infected seeds. They may have spores on the seed coat or fungal threads in the internal tissues. In both cases, the fungus gradually colonizes the developing plant and lead to the appearance of symptoms. The fungus can also overwinter on susceptible weeds or non-decomposed crop debris. In that case, the spores landing on healthy plant enter the tissues through the natural pores on leaves or through wounds.

       "  'data': 'Fusarium Head Blight\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe severity of symptoms depend on the type of crop (notable hosts are wheat, oat and barley), the time of infection and the environmental conditions. The disease is characterized by two types of symptoms: seedling blight and head blight. In the former, light-brown, water-soaked lesions appear at the base of the stem and the seedling turn necrotic during emergence. This is particularly striking when infected seeds are sown in cool, moist soil. During later stages of plant development, crown and basal stem rot are commonly observed. Water-soaked spikelets and a bleached straw color are two distinctive signs of head blight. During warm, humid weather, the they take a pink to light-brown cast, due to the abundant fungal growth. The kernels have a shriveled and rough appearance. Usually, the infection spread from spikelet to spikelet until the entire spike is affected. In some crops, yield losses have been evaluated to up to 70%.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeveral biocontrol agents have been tested successfully to reduce the effects of the infection by Fusarium graminearum. In wheat, different products containing the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus megatherium and Bacillus subtilis have been applied during flowering time to reduce the incidence of the disease, its severity and yield losses. Most of these trial were done in filed-controlled condition. Competitive fungi Trichoderma harzianum and Clonostachys rosea have also been used with some success. A dry heat treatment of 70 °C for 5 days was found to be an effective method to rid the seeds from this fungus, as well as others, from wheat and barley seeds.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Timing of fungicide applications is crucial for the control of Fusarium head blight. Foliar sprays during flowering time with fungicides of the triazole family (metconazole, tebuconazole, prothioconazole and thiabendazole) leads to a significant reduction of the incidence of the disease and the content of mycotoxin in the grain. Note that there are harvest restriction periods for these products.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms of head blight of cereals are caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, which survives in-between seasons in alternative hosts or in a latent state on crop debris and organic matter on the soil. Under favorable conditions, it starts to produce spores that may be transported by air currents over long distances. It is also thought that its spread could be facilitated by some species of midges. The susceptibility of cereals to this fungus is at its highest around the flowering period. Once it germinates on the plant tissue, it is able to penetrate the cuticle directly through natural pores. As it grows in the vascular tissues, it hinders the supply of water and nutrients in the spikes, resulting in the typically bleached spikelets and the shriveled kernels. Moreover, the production of toxins reduces the marketability of the grain. A range of environmental factors such as light intensity, temperatures, humidity, precipitations and leaf wetness can influence its life cycle. Temperatures between 20-32°C and prolonged leaf wetness are highly favorable.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse resistant varieties, if available.\\nChoose locations that are exposed to the sun and with good aeration.\\nIncrease crop spacing at sowing to allow for a good ventilation of the crop.\\nPlan a crop rotation with non-host species.\\nAvoid excessive fertilization with nitrogen.\\nCheck the necessity of tillage as this can favor the life cycle of the fungus.\\nClear the field and surrounding from weeds and alternative hosts.\\nRemove plant residues after harvest and bury them.'},\n",

Early infection of mature plants may not produce symptoms, except for a decrease in leaf area and number of tillers. However, dark-brown areas may be present at the base of the stem (foot rot) or below ground, and on internodes and roots (root rot). Later on, as the pathogen progresses into the stem, elongated, brown-black spots appear on lower leaves. This is particularly evident during prolonged periods of rain. Diseased plants occur randomly or in irregular patches, and are stunted and often chlorotic. A common symptom of late infections is the premature bleaching of one or more spikelets or the entire head (head blight).\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe fungus of Sporobolomyces roseus is a natural enemy of Cochliobolus sativus and has been used in cereals to reduce the incidence and severity of the disease.

Beside barley, wheat and rye, it can also infect a number of species of weeds and grasses. Oat is resistant to the disease but can still contribute to the dispersal of the pathogen. When a susceptible host is found and conditions are favorable, its spores germinate and initiate a primary infection on the young plant or its roots. It penetrates plant tissues either directly through the epidermis or via natural pores or wounds.

Herbs like lavender and tagetes can be mulched onto the soil around strawberry plants.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Commercial insecticides against biting insects provide decent control against the weevil. Use products during sunny days, when the weevils are located on the upper plant and flower parts.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nAdult weevils are black and 2-4mm long, including the rostrum or snout that characterized them. The weevil seek shelter and overwinters in plant debris or in the ground. In spring, the females lay about 30 eggs at a rate of one per bud, in the still closed flowers. The flower is prevented from opening by the adult weevils, which bore a hole in the stalk about 10 mm below the bud, thus preventing water and nutrients to reach it. Larvae hatch after 5-7 days, feed on the withering flower parts (anthers and style) until they eat into the buds and pupate. Adult weevils leave the withered bud and continue feeding on leaves of the strawberry plants. Strawberry blossom weevil also affects raspberry and blackberry.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the strawberry field regularly for symptoms of the pathogen.\\nRemove plant debris, which is the preferred location for the weevils to overwinter.\\nRemove weevils and withering buds regularly from the strawberry plants.\\nUse pheromone traps to monitor the populations.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Anthracnose of Lentil\\n\\nSymptoms\\nAnthracnose is characterized by the appearance of lesions on leaves, stems, pods and seeds. Oval, gray to tan-colored necrotic patches with dark brown margins develop on the older leaflets. In severe cases, these leaflets wilt, dry and fall off, causing defoliation of the plant. On stems, lesions are elongated, sunken and brownish with darker margins. As they enlarge, the lesions may cover the base of the stem and girdle it, causing the plant to wilt and die. Pods have circular and sunken lesions with reddish-brown margins and reddish centers. In all cases, small distinctive dark or black specks are visible on the dead tissue. Occasionally, a salmon-colored ooze may also appear in the center. Infected seeds are shriveled and discolored. Overall, plant vigor is drastically reduced and they may lodge during adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nFor some related species of fungus (on other crops), a certain control of the disease have been reached by soaking infested seeds in 52°C hot water for 30 minutes. Temperature and time should be complied precisely to ensure the desired effect of the treatment. Biological agents might also help to control the infection. The fungus Trichoderma harzianum and the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens used as a seed treatment compete with some species of Colletotrichum.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Seed treatments can be used for seed-borne infections. Various fungicides are recommended as foliar spray prior to flowering, repeating the application if the conditions for disease development are favorable. Formulations based on pyraclostrobin, chlorothalonil, prothioconazole or boscalid have been used successfully to hold the disease in check. Some cases of resistance to some of these products have been described.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Colletotrichum truncatum, that survives associated to seeds, in the soil or on plant debris for up to four years. There are two ways by which the infection is carried over to new plants. Primary infections happen when spores that grow in the soil infect seedling during emergence, growing systemically in the tissues. On other cases, the spores are splashed onto the lower leaves by rain drops and start an infection that spread upward. The fungus later produces more spores within the lesions developing on plant tissues (dark or black specks). These are dispersed by rain splashes to upper plant parts or to other plants (secondary infection). Cool to warm temperatures (optimal 20 to 24 °C), soils with high pH, prolonged leaf wetness (18 to 24 hours), frequent rain and dense canopies favor the disease. Nutritionally stressed crops are especially susceptible. In worst cases, yield losses can be as high as 50%.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse seeds from healthy plants or from certified sources.\\nChose a more resistant variety, if available.\\nKeep a wide space between plants at sowing.\\nFollow a minimum crop rotation of 4 years with non-host plants.\\nDo not plant lentils in fields that were previously infected.\\nRemove volunteer lentil plants and weeds in and around the field.\\nDo not plant peas or broad beans as they are alternative hosts.\\nDo not bury plant residues, as these can carry the fungus to the next crop.\\nLeave plant debris on the ground instead as the fungus decomposes quicker there.\\nAvoid no-till strategies, as they favor the pathogen.'},\n",

During severe infestations, the older larvae can remove whole leaves and even whole seedlings from the base. Characteristic for M. separata is also the cutting of the base of the panicles, and those that are left simply bend over or fall. Grass-green young larvae with dorsal stripes appear on the plants. Damage is often localized to one part of a field. During outbreaks many fields can be affected at the same time as the larvae migrate in groups between them.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSome aggressive strains of the wasps Cotesia ruficrus and Eupteromalus parnarae have been successfully implemented in fields. These insects lay eggs in the larvae of M. separata, killing them slowly. An important cultural method includes the raising of the water level when the population is in the pupal stage to drown them. Flooding also limits plant-to-plant dispersal of the larvae of M. separata. Ducks in paddy fields also help to control populations.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with both preventive measures and biological treatments if available. To prevent the caterpillars from moving to another field, apply a spray along the boundary of infested fields with cypermethrin to avoid the migration of the larvae. If there is high infestation of army worm, chemical spray is necessary. It is recommended to spray cypermethrin @ 1 ml / 1 l water. The best time to spray is in the later part of the day.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of the rice ear-cutting caterpillar, Mythimna separata. Adults have grayish-yellow forewings with a dark-gray or reddish-yellow tinge and peppered with numerous black specks. Females lay round, greenish-white to white eggs on the leaves, either bare or covered with a thin layer of blackish felt.

Yellow stunt or “yellow disease complex” seems to be triggered by excessive moisture levels at the root zone, resulting in a lack of aeration for the roots. Within this context, the collapse of the tobacco roots favours the penetration or alters the plant susceptibility towards the invasion of pathogens associated with the yellow stunt.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nUse plant varieties that are resistant to soil pathogens.\\nChemical Control\\nThe yellow stunt cannot be chemically controlled and occurs due to poor water management and soil saturation.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nTobacco has a low tolerance to O2 deficit and the excess of CO2. And the combination of excessive moisture, lack of oxygen and high temperatures could cause the root system to collapse. The collapse of tobacco roots favours the penetration of pathogens such as Fusarium spp., Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium spp. etc. associated with a yellow stunt.

The symptoms are first visible on older foliage, initially at the basal part of the leaf and leaf sheath and are characterized by long pale green or yellow stripes on the lamina. As the disease progresses, the stripes gradually extend to the rest of the leaves. The older ones become brown and necrotic and later coalesce to form large bands of necrotic tissues that can cover the whole leaf. The decay of the leaves is visible as splits along the necrotic tissue and the fringe-like margins that give them a shredded appearance. Moreover, infected plants usually are stunted and produce sterile and distorted heads that may fail to emerge from the sheath. Ear length may also be reduced with fewer and poorly developed, brown grains.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo this day, no biological treatment is available to treat this disease. Let us know if you know of any.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Seed treatments are useful to reduce the incidence of the disease during the emergence of seedlings. If seeds from affected crops are re-sown without an effective fungicidal seed treatment, the disease is bound to propagate in the area large yield losses can be expected. Different formulations of methfuroxam, carboxin + thiram have been used with success. Note that germination rates could be lower after those treatments. Systemic fungicides can also be used to treat infected plants but have to be evaluated against costs and benefits.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the seed-borne fungus Pyrenophora graminea, which survives in the outer layers of the infected seed. The seedlings are infected by the fungus at emergence under cool, moist conditions and a soil temperature below 15 °C. The fungus penetrates the plant tissues through small injuries in the leaflets when those come out of the surface and grows systemically within the plant. The symptoms on leaves are triggered by fungal toxins that kill the plant cells and discolor leaf tissue between veins. The alternating of healthy and diseased tissues causes the striped aspect of the lesions. When conditions are wet or humid, black fungal structures on the leaf surface produce spores that are then carried to the spikes of healthy plant. Warm and dry environments, without irrigation, hinder the life cycle of the fungus. The balanced supply of nutrients, particularly copper and iron also reduced the incidence of leaf stripe disease.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChose resistant varieties, if available.\\nIf possible, delay the sowing date to decrease the infection.\\nGrow plants aimed at seed production in semi-arid environment, without irrigation.\\nShallow sowing results in less infection than deep sowing (2-3 and 4-5 cm respectively).\\nPlan a balanced fertilization, particularly with a good supply of copper and iron.'},\n",

The symptoms can easily be mistaken for herbicide damage and usually start with the clearing of the veins. Later on, the chlorosis extends to the rest of the leaf blade, until i engulfs it entirely. In some crops, the foliage may be reddening instead. Other symptoms include the deformation and greening of flowers, the development of leaf-like flower petals and the formation of sterile flowers. Overall, plants have a reduced root system and a stunted appearance.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nApply bioinsecticides containing parasitic fungi species such as Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus and Verticillium lecanii to control acute infestation.

Beneficial insects such as ladybugs and lacewing are also voracious predators of both the egg and larval stage of these insects. Insecticidal soaps also work.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated apporach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Formulations based on lambda-cyhalothrin, and indoxacarb show a relatively high efficacy towards leafhoppers and can help to limit the spread of the disease in the field.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by an obligate bacterial parasite of plant vascular tissues called phytoplasma asteris. The plant-to-plant transmission is mostly through insect vectors, mainly leafhoppers. Conditions that favor the movement and feeding of these insects in the field also enhance the spread of the phytoplasma. For example, wind, rainfall or temperatures below 15°C can temporarily halt their migration and delay the time of infection. Weather conditions of the region also greatly influence leafhopper feeding patterns. If conditions are hot, plants are less nutrient-rich and become less attractive to the leafhoppers. Seasons with abundant rainfall allow the plants to have much more lush growth and become more attractive. The leafhoppers then feed all summer until they migrate back to their overwintering sites in the fall.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nRegularly monitor the fields for symptoms of leafhopper infestation and of the disease.\\nInfected plants should be removed to eliminate the source of the phytoplasma and minimize spread.\\nUse yellow sticky traps that are very attractive to green leafhoppers.\\nTry to promote a good environment for beneficial insects such as ladybugs, parasitic wasps and lacewing.\\nSince leafhoppers can overwinter in weeds and perennial ornamentals, such as thistle, dandelion, and carrots, avoid these plants in the field.'},\n",

Leaves are short, narrow, pale-green or yellow, with a mottled appearance. A closer look shows numerous dark-brown or rust-colored spots or patches on the leaf surface, which often cover the whole leaf. When infected during the seedling stage the plants rarely reach maturity. Plants affected at a later stage usually do reach maturity but generally fail to produce panicles, thus impacting on yields.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDirect treatment of viral diseases is not possible. Neem Seed Kernel Extracts can help to reduce the populations of brown planthoppers and thereby suppress the transmission of RGSV.

The application of insecticides is not always successful in controlling vector populations, especially in regions where rice is grown throughout the year\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe virus is transmitted by brown planthoppers of the species Nilaparvata (N. lungens, N. bakeri and N. muiri). Both nymphs and adults have to potential carry the virus for long periods and thus infect new plants in a persistent and propagative manner. However, the planthoppers need to feed on an infected plant for at least 30 minutes to pick-up the virus. The disease is mainly found in South and Southeast Asia, China, Japan, and Taiwan, Indonesia, Philippines and India, particularly in areas where rice monoculture is practiced.

Pears are only an intermediate host for the pathogen and both trees are actually needed to complete its life cycle. It is not able to survive on dead plant material, so it must alternate between hosts. The fungus hibernates in juniper, which is its primary host. In spring, the spores spread from juniper and infect nearby pear trees. The spots that emerge on the underside of the pear leaves are in fact spore-producing structures. These spores cannot reinfect pear leaves, so by the end of the summer, they are dispersed over long distances (up to 500 meters) to infect new junipers.

       "  'data': 'Sugarcane Pyrilla\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe pest is found on the underside of the leaves where they suck up plant sap. This causes the yellowing first and then the drying of leaves. Under low infestation, yellow patches appear on the leaf surface. Photosynthesis is reduced resulting in the stunting of the plant. Hoppers also secrete a sweet substance called honeydew that coats the leaves. This attracts opportunistic fungi whose growth blackens the leaf blade. This reduces photosynthesis even more, resulting in yield loss. Beside maize, they also readily attack sugarcane, millets, rice, barley, oats, sorghum, bajra and wild grasses.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeveral parasitoids attack eggs and nymphs. Egg parasitoids include Tetrastichus pyrillae, Cheiloneurus pyrillae, Ooencyrtus pyrillae, O. pipilionus and Agoniaspis pyrillae. Nymphs are attacked by Lestodryinus pyrillae, Pyrilloxenos ompactus, Chlorodryinus pallidus, Epiricania melanoleuca. Predators of this insect also include several species of ladybirds such as Coccinella septempunctata, C. undecimpunctata, Chilomenes sexmaculata, Brumus suturalis. Egg-predators are Nimboa basipunctata, Goniopteryx pusana.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Products containing Chlorpyriphos are effective against this pest.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the adults of Pyrilla perpusilla, a very active plant hopper that breed throughout the year and may migrate from field to field, causing major damage. Adults are greenish to straw-colored and about 7-8 mm in length. They are usually found feeding gregariously on plants and jump off readily when disturbed. Their pointed snout hide the mouth parts with which they pierce and suck plant tissues. Spreading of the pest is favored by high humidity and rapid plant growth, for example in heavily manured or fertilized fields. Excess irrigation or the rainy season also contributes to its propagation.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the field regularly for symptoms of the pest.\\nRemove infected plant after harvest and burn them.\\nDo not use broad-range insecticides as this can affect negatively beneficial insects.'},\n",

The severity of the disease and its spreading depend to a high degree on the variety, the growth stage and the environmental conditions. Infected plants show a progressive yellowing and wilting of the leaves, and uneven and premature ripening of the fruit. However, the most characteristic symptom is the excretion of a yellowish bacterial ooze from the plant organs. A cross section of an infected banana shows a yellow- orange discoloration of the vascular bundles and dark brown scarings of the tissues. Symptoms on the inflorescence include a gradual wilting of the bracts and shriveling of the male buds.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo this day, no biological treatment is known to control the spreading of this bacteria. Please notify us if you know of any.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Conventional antibiotics have been used to manage plant diseases caused by this bacteria but they are seldom cost-effective. In some cases herbicides have been advised as a more economical and effective way of destroying infected banana crop and avoiding the spread of the disease.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum, a particularly tenacious bacteria that can cause considerable damage in banana plantations. Its spreading occurs via infected plant material, contaminated tools, airborne vectors through exposed male flowers. The bacteria can also contaminate the soil for up to 4 months and this is the main sources of inoculum. Moisture levels affected survival, which was lowest in the drier soils. Airborne vectors include insects of the families of the stingless bees (Apidae), fruit flies (Drosophilidae) and grass flies (Chloropidae). These transmit the disease from banana to banana after being drawn to the infected nectar produced by male flowers.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nConsider quarantine regulations when importing plant material.\\nChose resistant varieties, if available in your area.\\nMonitor the plantations regularly for signs of the disease.\\nQuickly remove and destroy infected plants and debris from the plantation.\\nMake sure to use clean and sterilized tools.\\nRemove male flowers to prevent vector transmission.\\nAvoid transport of any infested plant material between plantations.'},\n",

Dark-green blister-like structures first appear on leaves. Later, these develop into a mottled pattern in different shades of green. At later stages of the disease, leaves have a shoestring appearance and show a mosaic pattern with yellow and brown necrotic spots. Leaf size is considerably reduced, resulting in stunted growth and smaller canopy. Water-soaked yellow spots and oily streaks also appear on stems and petioles. Infected fruits show many dark green, often sunken, oily ring spots of reduced size and deformed shape. If infection takes place at an early age, fruits are not marketable.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSpray white oil emulsions at concentrations of 1% to hinder the uptake and transmission of the virus by aphids. Mixtures of beneficial microorganisms including some types of bacteria, yeasts, actinomycetes and photosynthetic bacteria can reduce the incidence of the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. There is no direct chemical treatment for viral infections. However, a foliar spray of di-methoate or azadirachtin can reduce the population of aphids. Apply the spray every fortnight after the first symptoms appearance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe virus is transmitted by numerous species of aphids in a non-persistent manner. Since it does not multiply in aphids, the transmission from plant to plant must happen within short periods of time (no longer than one minute). The virus has a variety of alternative hosts such as watermelon and other cucurbits, but its preferred target is papaya.

Symptoms in mature plants can be due to the spreading of a primary infection to new tissues (systemic) or resulting from secondary infections. Interveinal chlorosis, curling and wilting of older leaves (sometimes only on one side) characterize the systemic spreading. Later on, the leaves eventually turn brown and collapse. Petiole usually remain green and firmly attached to the stem. New infections are characterized by dark brown lesions at the leaf margin and round spots with a bright halo on the leaf blade. The stalk base is rotten and dark-brown and brown vertical stripes appear on the upper part. Stem later split forming long, brown cankers. On the fruits, brown spots with a bright halo appear.

You can also use methyl bromide or water treatments.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Under conditions of frequent rainfall and prolonged wet periods, the use of sprays with bactericides may be justified. These can reduce the incidence of foliar blight and fruit spotting. If preventive measures are followed, the application of copper-based products offer little added benefits since localized infections pose a small economic threat.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe bacteria can survive on seeds, in plant residues or in the soil. The transmission occurs via infected seeds, pathogens in the soil, or during pinching. The bacteria multiply in the leaf veins and hinder water and nutrient transport. As a result, the plant starts wilting and withering.

During storage, potatoes display silvery spots that enlarge into circles with defined brown margins. The lesions later coalesce and may turn brown, making them hardly visible on unwashed potatoes. The appearance of lesions also varies with the potato variety, mostly due to skin types. The outer skin layer of infected potatoes softens and wrinkles and eventually peel off. Secondary infections with other pathogens may occur.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNatural biocides (hydrogen peroxide) or biological products (Bacillus subtilis, clove oil) have shown limited or no efficacy in reducing the risk of infection with silver scurf.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. The application of fungicides to seed potatoes prior to planting or at harvest may prevent infection. Thiabendazole, applied to tubers as dusts, can reduce the incidence of silver scurf in the next season or during storage.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSilver Scurf is caused by the seed-borne fungus Helminthosporium solani. It survives on tubers for long periods of time and infects the skin. The infection can arise from the soil, the use of infected seed tubers or remaining spores in storage rooms. Temperatures of 3°C and relative humidities lower than 90% during storage hinders the development of the disease. The formation of condensation on the tubers during storage (warm air meets cold tubers) exacerbates the problem.

Later on, mature stems show a black discoloration of their internal tissues that give them a charred appearance, thereby the name. The rot slowly colonizes the vascular tissue, and hard fibrous tissues with black fungal specks are visible between the internodes. The destruction of transport tissues leads to symptoms similar to water deficiency. Plants ripen prematurely and have weak stalks, causing breakage or lodging. Upper leaves first become yellow and then dry out. Brown, water-soaked lesions are present on the roots. In cases of strong infection, more than 50% of plants can break.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nOrganic treatments such as farmyard manure, neem oil extracts and mustard cake can be used to control Macrophomina diseases. Soil amendment with pearl millet and weed-based composts can lead to a decrease in soil population of the fungus of 20-40%. Soil application of Trichoderma viride (5 kg enriched on 250 kg of vermicompost or FYM) at the time of sowing also helps.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Foliar application of fungicides is not effective, as damage has already occurred when the first symptoms occur. Fungicide-treated seeds (with mancozeb for example) may offer protection during seedling growth. The application of 80 kg/ha of MOP in two splits also help to fortify plants and make them more tolerant to this fungus.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThis disease is caused by the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, which thrives in hot and dry environments. It overwinters for periods of up to three years on host crop residues or in the soil. The infection of roots and transport tissue of the stem leads to an impairment of the transport of water and nutrients, thereby the drying of the upper parts of the plant, the premature ripening and the weak stalks. Further favorable conditions for the spreading of the fungus are provided by insects, damaged roots and shoots as well as other plant diseases. Symptoms are are worsened during drought, elevated soil temperatures (over 28°C) and excessive fertilization at later stages of plant growth.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nGrow drought tolerant varieties.\\nPlant lodging-resistant varieties.\\nAdjust the sowing date so that the post-flowering stage is not in the driest part of the growing season.\\nUse wider spacing between the plants.\\nMaintain good soil moisture through irrigation, especially during the post-flowering period.\\nEnsure balanced fertilization and avoid excessive nitrogen use.\\nHarvest early to avoid major yield losses.\\nRotate with non-host crops such as small wheat, oats, rice, barley and rye for three years.\\nPlan a deep summer plowing to reduce the pathogen inoculum in the soil.\\nThis may help decrease the population of the fungus in the soil.\\nSolarization of soil or a longer fallow after tillage may also be effective.\\nIn endemic areas farmers are advised to incorporate green manure in soil before sowing of maize.'},\n",

The secondary veins in these spots appear brownish. As the spots enlarge they change from yellow to reddish brown and become angular since they are delimited by the main veins (thereby the common name of the disease). As the leaf tissue becomes necrotic, the lesions usually develop a yellow margin between healthy and diseased tissue. In the case of red grape varieties, this margin is red. Infections that take place late in the season are characterized by the development of freckled spots on leaves, and can cause premature defoliation and the drying out of infected flower clusters. Unlike Botrytis blight, this disease infects only the stem of the berries, not the rachis.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological treatments are available against this disease. The best way to avoid heavy losses is to remove severely infected twigs or entire plants and destroy them by deep-burying or burning in distance to the orchard. Good weeding and sanitation programs are also recommended.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. The disease can be controlled by applying fungicides containing mancozeb before rainy weather. Applications should begin at early shoot growth, and protection should be maintained through fruit set, even more so during rainy weather.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe fungus P. tetraspora, which causes angular leaf scorch survives the winter in infected leaves on the vineyard floor. Therefore, foliage free dormant cuttings do not provide a pathway for these fungi. During wet weather in spring fungal spores are released from these fallen leaves and spread by wind and water splashes to new leaves and flower stems. There is normally only one cycle of infection in spring from the overwintering fungus on the decaying leaves. Occasionally after several consecutive days of constant rainfall, spores may be formed on the dead tissue of infected leaves still attached to the vine. These spores can cause secondary infections any time during the growing season if moist conditions persist. This explains why the disease may seem absent in most years but can be severe in years with prolonged rainy weather.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nOnly obtain planting material from certified sources.\\nEnsure sufficient space between vines.\\nImplement measures that increase air circulation between plants, for example through pruning.\\nMonitor the vineyard regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nMaintain a high standard of hygiene, for example by removing weeds and plant debris from the vineyard.\\nDestroy dry or infected vines by burning or deep-burying them in distance to the vineyard.\\nMake sure not to transport leave trash on harvested fruit or machinery between vineyards.'},\n",

In very severe cases, sprays containing the insecticide deltamethrin or lambda-cyhalothrin can be used to kill the emerging aphids. Do not wait for visible symptoms to act, as there's no point in spraying once the leaves have become puckered. Do not spray flowering plants due to the danger to bees and other pollinating insects.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the redcurrant blister aphid, Cryptomyzus ribis. The puckered and blistered leaf tissues are often more noticeable than the wingless, pale yellow aphids that suck the sap on the leaf underside, visible starting late spring or early summer. The blisters and the discoloration are due to the injection of chemicals into the foliage during the feeding process. By midsummer winged aphids are produced which migrate to secondary host plants, mainly hedge woundwort (Stachys sylvatica). These return to the currant by autumn, and lay overwintering eggs on the shoots. The eggs hatch in spring and form aphid colonies that migrate to the lower side of leaves. Currant blister aphid affects red, white and black currant, as well as the wild relative jostaberry (also genus Ribes). As the crop usually is not affected, control measures only need to be applied in very severe cases.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor currants and related hosts regularly for the presence of C.\\nribis and their symptoms.\\nDo not apply insecticides indiscriminately since this can affect populations of natural predators such as ladybugs.\\nAvoid excessive fertilization with nitrogen as the resulting lush foliage will attract more aphids.\\nRemove waste from previous cultures.\"},\n",

A thin dark streak or dotted dark line, that corresponds to the larval frass, is visible inside the tunnels, more conspicuous from the underside. Larvae are often found at the end of these tunnels and several of them can be present per leaf. The damage to the leaves can be a source of infection by opportunistic fungi or bacteria. Heavy infestation can also lead to lower photosynthetic rates, resulting in stunted growth, reduced fruit size and quality. In severe cases, citrus leafminer infection can even cause total tree defoliation and eventual death for young trees.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPredators include the green lacewings of the Neuroptora genus. There is also a wide array of parasitic wasps that attack and feed on the larvae of the citrus leafminer, among others, species of Tetrastichus. Organic insecticides containing spinosad, fish oil resin soap and Pongamia oil may be used as foliar spray applications to control the infestation by citrus leafminer. Neem oil can also be applied to deter the moths from laying their eggs on the leaves.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments. Insecticides are not entirely effective against infestations of citrus leafminer because larvae are protected by the leaf cuticle.

The adults are tiny, brownish or gray moths with heavily fringed wings and a typical dark spot on the top of the front wing. They are mainly active during the cool temperatures of dawn and dusk, early morning and night. In spring, the females lay their eggs on the lower side of leaves. The hatching larvae are translucent greenish or yellow and feed mainly on leaves, even though fruits can also be attacked. They bore tunnels between the two leaf epidermis, resulting in distinctive silvery, serpentine mines. At the end of the larval stage, the leafminer emerge from the mine and enters its pupa stage by curling the leaf around itself. It is a major pest of citrus, found in virtually all major citrus-producing areas. Moreover, the susceptibility to other diseases, such as bacterial canker, is increased.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nSelect varieties that are partly resistant to the citrus leafminer.\\nPlant billy goat weed (Ageratum conyzoides) as ground cover between the trees.\\nMonitor orchards regularly, mainly the underside of leaves, for signs of the disease.\\nCollect and destroy fallen leaves in winter to reduce insect hidings.\\nUse pheromone traps to attract the moths and monitor populations.\\nPrune the trees so that to avoid the appearance of new growth during peaks of infestation.\\nPrune suckers accordingly.\\nAvoid an excess of pesticides that can harm beneficial insects.'},\n",

They have to be applied in a timely manner. Granular formulations are preferred. Products containing cyfluthrin, esfenvalerate can be spayed on whorls and developing ears. Synthetic pyrethroids can also be used for this purpose.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe larvae overwinter in crop debris in the soil and emerge in the spring. The adults of the European maize borer are active during the night. Male moths have a thin body with brown tinges, and tan-to-brown wings with yellow serrated patterns. Females are thinner, yellowish brown with several darker zigzagging bands across the wings. They lay white egg masses on the underside of leaves, usually when the wind is calm and temperatures are warm. Larvae are dirty white to pinkish tan, with smooth, hairless skin and dark spots all over their bodies. Their head is dark brown to black. They feed on an array of weeds and alternative hosts such as soybeans, peppers and tomatoes. Low humidity, low nighttime temperatures, and heavy rain are detrimental to egg-laying and the survival of the borer.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse tolerant varieties if available.\\nPlant early to avoid peak populations of the pest.\\nRegularly monitor the fields and use traps to avoid population build-up.\\nEnsure a good weed management in and around the field.\\nPlow deep to dig the pupae overwintering in the soil and the plant residues.\\nRotate with non-host crops to break the life cycle of the pest.'},\n",

No pest or pathogens are involved. Calcium promotes the strength and firmness of tissues. Calcium deficiency can occur due to the unavailability of this nutrient in the soil or the incapacity of the plant to absorb it and distribute it to its fruits. This leads to the destruction of the tissue structure, resulting in the characteristic dark, sunken areas. Irregular irrigation or root damage can be the cause of calcium deficiency.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nAdjust soil pH-levels, for example through liming.\\nUse mulch to keep soils moist.\\nAvoid root damage through deep cultivation practices.\\nEnsure fertilization low in nitrogen and rich in calcium.\\nEnsure regular irrigation during dry periods.\\nAvoid over-watering and allow for good drainage of the fields.\\nUse nitrate forms of nitrogen rather than ammonium.'},\n",

Necrosis start to appear from the leaf margins and defoliation may occur, but more often, leaves remain attached to the branches. Infected blossoms become dry and brown, a sign of blight. Young developing almond fruits often have round, crater-like sunken lesions with a reddish to orange staining on the surface. This symptom may appear about 3 weeks after petal fall. Lesions continue to appear until the fruit are about 20 mm long, after which no further symptoms developed. As the fungus grows and makes its way into the kernel, often killing the embryo, profuse gum is produce, which is excreted from the lesions on the hull. Affected nuts turn into mummies and often remained attached to the branches. As the disease progresses, the shoots and branches that bear infected nuts often become infected and die.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo this day, no biological control of anthracnose in almond is known. We would be delighted to get any recipe from you.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Repeated fungicide applications may be necessary through the spring as trees should be protected before rain events. Fungicides provide protection for up to 10 days, and should be repeated if rain occurs. First fungicidal applications are recommended at the pink bud stage (pre-bloom) to protect the blossoms. Several products based on the active ingredients azoxystrobin, propiconazole, metconazole, myclobutanil and chlorothalonil could be used. Several combinations of these same products are recommended after bloom as a way to avoid the development of resistance in the fungus\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, a fungus that also infects other crops such as citrus, strawberry and celery, triggering a variety of symptoms. It survives in infected tissues and resume growth once the weather conditions are favorable. Anthracnose is most severe during wet, rainy warm springs (over15 °C) with an early summer onset. All almond varieties are susceptible to the disease, but they vary in their degree of susceptibility. The death of shoots and branches is not directly due to the colonization of these tissues by fungus but rather by a toxin that is produced by the fungus and transported by the vascular tissue there. The dieback of shoots affects the current year’s crop as well as the production of nuts in the next seasons.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nSelect sites with low rainfalls to grow almond trees.\\nLeave sufficient space between plants.\\nPlant resistant or less susceptible varieties, if available (several have been put on the market).\\nImplement good drainage methods.\\nPrune out dead, infected wood to reduces inoculum.\\nUse sprinkler irrigation with low angle nozzles to prevent the tree canopy from getting wet.\\nMonitor the orchard regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nKeep the field clear of weeds.\\nRemove infected almond tree parts as well as decaying leaves and remaining floral parts.\\nRemoved tissue should be destroyed by burning or deep burying.'},\n",

New leaves are often smaller and narrower and have wavy margins. Over time, the yellow (chlorotic) spots can turn a bronze color and dead (necrotic) spots may start to develop from the margins. In some crops, zinc-deficient leaves often have shortened internodes, so leaves are clustered on the stem (rosetting).

High levels of soil phosphorus and calcium (calcareous soils) also affect the availability of zinc to plants. In fact, phosphorus application can show negative effects on zinc uptake. The addition of calcium-rich materials such as limestone or chalk (liming) also offsets soil acidity and reduces the uptake of zinc by the plants (even though the levels in the soil remain unchanged).

Dipping plantlets in specific fungicides (10g/10 litres of water) followed by drenching of the soil every second month starting 6 months after planting is recommended.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nPanama disease (also called Fusarium wilt) is caused by a subspecies of the fungus Fusarium oxyporum, that can survive in soils for decades. It enters the plant through the tiny root hairs, a process that is favored in light, poorly drained soils. It is be spread over short distances by surface water, vehicles, tools and footwear. Infected planting material, in turn, is the most common way the disease is spread over long distances. Elevated temperatures are an important component in the progression of the disease. The chlorosis of leaves and the lack of plant vigor occurs due to the decay of the transport tissues in the stem which leads to impaired water and nutrient transport.

Distorted leaves, yellowing foliage, poor growth and branch dieback are the consequence of this activity. A white, fluffy covering and honeydew appear near the feeding sites. On bark and shoots, the development of cankers and swellings is also characteristic. Underground forms of the aphid also attack roots and lead to the formation of swollen enlargements or large knots. The impaired transport of water and nutrients explains the yellowish appearance of the trees. These galls increase in size from year to year as a result of aphid feeding. The wounds caused by the insects and the presence of the honeydew also attract opportunistic fungi that may cover the infected tissues with sooty mold. Young plants are easily uprooted when infested.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSpray solutions must be able to penetrate the woolly coat secreted by the aphids to kill them. Diluted alcohol solutions or insecticidal soaps can be splashed over the woolly spots to disturb them. Ecological oils or neem abstracts (2-3 ml/l water) can also be sprayed over the trees. Good coverage and a follow-up spray 7 days after first application are essential. Parasites or predators such as lacewings, ladybugs (Exochomus quadripustulatus), hoverflies larvae, and parasitic wasps (Aphelinus mali) can help to control populations. Artificial refuges foster populations of predator earwigs, for example Forficula auricularia.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chemical controls can be applied either preventively or after detection. Systemic treatments can be useful to deter the aphids from feeding on treated plants. Unfortunately they can also be harmful to beneficial insects. Reactive sprays include formulations based on deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and acetamiprid. Carbamates and pyrethroids should be avoided as they encourage outbreaks of aphids by killing parasites and predators. Trees in flower should not be sprayed due to the danger to pollinating insects.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the woolly aphid Eriosoma lanigerum. Unlike most aphids, it sucks sap from the woody stems and shoots, rather than from foliage. This insect is characterized by its white, thick, fluffy wax covering. It overwinters on its host in cracks on the bark or on suberised wounds around old feeding sites. As temperatures increase in the spring, the aphids become active again and climb on the suckers, younger shoots and branches in search of a vulnerable sites (areas with thinner bark). There, it feeds gregariously, sucking sap from beneath the bark, and starts secreting the fluffy hairs that eventually wrapped the colony. Opportunistic pathogen can then colonize these open wounds. During the summer, the adults grow wings and fly off in search of new host plants. Elm trees in the vicinity of orchards increase the migration of the aphid to apple orchards.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose resistant varieties if available.\\nIn mild infestations, the insect can be monitored and scrubbed with a brush.\\nApply fortifiers or balanced fertilization to strengthen the plants.\\nAvoid the excessive usage of pesticides as they can decrease populations of beneficial insects.\\nSummer prune in late summer to remove developing colonies.\\nRemove affected young shoots and branches.\\nRemove suckers at the base of the plant to create less favorable conditions for the aphids.\\nPaint large pruning cuts with commercial pruning paint to discourage aphid colonies.\\nDo not plant elm trees close to apple tree orchards.'},\n",

At high levels of infestation, these specks merge into larger spots that give the leaf or the green fruit a uniform silvery or bronze appearance. The attacked tissue gradually harden and decay, leading to premature leaf fall, twig dieback, reduced quality of fruits and decreased vigor of the trees.

Because of the web nests, phytoseiid mites (for example Euseius stipulatus) are not effective against this mite. Some species of ladybird of the genus Stethorus feed voraciously on the pest. Fungi, and particularly viruses, also play a major role in controlling populations in the field, something that may be influenced by temperature.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Selective pesticides are highly recommended, as broad-spectrum insecticides, by killing predators and other beneficial insects, may aggravate the situation. A rotation of several types of acaricides avoids the development of resistance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the adults and nymphs of the citrus Hindu mite Schizotetranychus hindustanicus. They are characterized by peculiar web nests (1-3 mm in diameter) that females produce on the underside of leaves and under which the colony develops. This characteristic differentiate them from other mites and give them their other common name 'nest-webbing mite'. Adults move out of the nest and attack other leaves or fruit tissues, while immature stages prefer to settle under the web. Insects and birds may transport and spread the mites to other trees. Infected tools and bad field practices can also propagate the pest to other fields.

Black spot disease is characterized by the appearance of small, reddish-brown or black circular spots (1-3 mm) surrounded by a green yellow halo on fruits and leaves. As the disease progresses, these spots coalesce to form larger patches that can cover up to 50% of the fruit surface. On leaves, they become chlorotic and may lead to premature shedding. The outer part of the fruit starts rotting, while the edible tissue remains undamaged. A slightly abnormal skin color or changes in shape of the fruit can be external signs of heart rot but often the fruit retain their healthy appearance until harvest.

Other pesticides of the families of the organophosphates (malathion) and pyrethroids have also been used against O. melanopus.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is mainly caused by the larvae of the beetle Oulema melanopus. Adults are about 5 mm long and have dark-blue wing covers with a red head and legs. They spread to the exterior of the field and spend their overwintering time in protected areas such as wind rows, crop stubble, and tree bark crevices. They emerge when the environmental conditions improve during spring, at temperatures around 10 °C. Warm springs are favorable for its life cycle, while cold periods hinder it. After mating, the females start to lay bright yellow, cylindrical eggs on the underside of leaves, often along the midvein, and continue to do so over an extended period (45-60 days). The larvae hatch after 7-15 days and start feeding on the upper epidermis of the leaves, causing the worst damage. They are white or yellow, hump-backed, and have a black head and six small legs. As they reach maturation after 2-3 weeks of feeding, they pupate and give rise to the adult beetles in 20-25 days, starting the cycle again.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse resistant varieties.\\nCheck quarantine regulation in the area or at the national level.\\nMonitor fields regularly during early spring, when temperature get warmer.'},\n",

The affected tiller inhibits growth of leaves and fails to produce panicles. Plant stunting and leaf deformity, wilting and rolling are also symptoms caused by drought, potassium deficiency, salinity, and by rice thrips. To confirm cause of problem, check for presence of insects. Particularly, elongated-tubular eggs and maggot-like larva feeding inside developing buds.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nParasitization with platygasterid, eupelmid, and pteromalid wasps (parasitize the larvae), phytoseiid mites (feed on eggs), spiders (feed on adults) have successfully been used.

For example, spraying with mancozeb @ 2.5 g/l of water at 8-10 days interval is effective against the pathogen.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nNorthern leaf spot of maize is caused by the fungus Helminthosporium carbonum, which overwinters on corn residues in the soil. The spores on these debris serve as primary source of infection during wet weather. Secondary infection from plant to plant is wind- or rain-driven. The disease develops mainly on plants used in seed production and is therefore rarely a problem in the fields, where mostly resistant hybrids are grown.

Poison baits containing chlorpyriphos can also be used.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nAdult moths are light to reddish brown with a wingspan of 4-5 cm and thoracic hair. Their forewings are grayish yellow and scattered with black specks. They have two small clear spots with an indistinct edge in the center. Their hindwings are blueish gray with dark veins and dark external margins. Adults are nocturnal and strongly attracted to light. Females lay pale, creamy eggs under the leaves. They survive better and produce more eggs when temperatures are above 15°C. Caterpillars are stout and usually pale greenish to brown in color. They have longitudinal stripes running along the body with the ones on the flanks being broken into black spots. They are nocturnal and thrive in well fertilized fields. Favorable conditions for an outbreak include prolonged dry periods followed by heavy rainfall.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nAdjust the time of sowing to avoid peak populations.\\nCheck your plants regularly for any sign of the pest.\\nHandpick the larvae found in plants.\\nUse light or pheromone traps to monitor infestations.\\nControl weeds in and around the fields.\\nDig trenches around infested plots to control the movements of the larvae.\\nFlood the seedbeds to drown the larvae.\\nRemove crop residues from the field and burn them.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Fusarium Stem Rot\\n\\nSymptoms\\nClearing of veinlets and chlorosis of leaves are the initial disease symptoms. In young plants, symptoms consist of veinlet clearing, following by drooping of petioles. Yellowing is first observed on lower leaves. These leaflets wilt and die eventually, spreading the symptoms to subsequent leaves. At a later stage, the browning of the vascular system occurs. The lower leaves and later all leaves of the plant will drop off. The plants become stunted and die. Soft, dark brown or black cankers appear on the stem, usually at nodes and wound sites, causing girdling of the stem. The lesions develop light orange-coloured, very small, flask-shaped fruiting structures of the fungus (perithecia). White-cottony fungal growth may form on the plant. The roots, when infected, become dark brown, soft and water soaked. Pepper fruits might develop black, water-soaked lesions beginning at the calyx.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeveral biological control agents, including bacteria and nonpathogenic strains of F. oxysporum that compete with the pathogens, have been used to control Fusarium wilt in some crops. Trichoderma viride @ 1% WP or @ 5% SC can also be used to treat the seeds (10g/kg seed). Other products based on Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens are also effective. Trichoderma harzianum can be applied to the soil.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Apply soil-based fungicides on contaminated locations if no other measures are effective. Drenching the soil with Copper Oxychloride @ 3g/l of water before sowing/transplanting is also effective. Other products based on Carbendazim, Fipronil, Fluchloralin can also be applied to limit the disease spread.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nFusarium solani is a fungus that grows in transport tissue of plants, affecting water and nutrient supply. Plants can be infected directly via their root tips or through wounds in the roots. Once the pathogen has become established in an area, it stays active for several years as it can create overwintering spores. Soil-borne diseases survive in soil and spread through seed, soil, water, seedling, workers, irrigation water and wind (by carrying infected plant debris). The fungus is a serious disease-causing organism that affects various hosts. If infestation happens at flowering stage, serious yield loss can be expected. Stem cankers restrict the upward flow of water, which causes wilting and eventually the death of plant. Fusarium solani can colonize dead or dying plant tissues and actively ejects spores nightly. Favourable conditions of the fungi are relatively high soil moisture and soil temperature. Poor water drainage or overwatering support the disease spread.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant only healthy plants from the available resistant varieties, such as Phule Jyoti and Phule Mukta.\\nMonitor the plants for symptoms, such as wilting or stem lesions.\\nHandpick and remove affected plants carefully.\\nDiscard them by either placing them in a landfill or burning them far away.\\nKeep your equipment and tools clean, particularly when working between different fields.\\nAvoid damage to the plants during field work.\\nGood crop hygiene and pruning by clean cutting can help control the disease.\\nAdjusting the soil pH to 6.5-7.0 and using nitrate rather than ammonium as nitrogen sources can reduce the severity of the disease.\\nIn greenhouses, use precisely adjusted drip irrigation.\\nAvoid use of excessive fertilizer concentration.\\nAfter harvest, remove plant debris and burn them.\\nKeep in mind that the rotting can continue in storage.\\nDisinfect the seedbeds by covering the area with black plastic foil under direct sunlight for a month.\\nFollow crop rotation to reduce levels of fungi in the soil.'},\n",

Additionally, leaf veins can thicken and darken, and outgrowths (enactions) may form on the undersides of leaves, typically in the shape of leaves. Flowers may stay closed and then drop along with the bolls. If plants are infected early in the season, their growth will be stunted and yield will be reduced significantly.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nWhitefly populations can generally be controlled by natural enemies (e.g. lacewings, bigeyed bugs, minute pirate bugs), so be careful not to kill them with rampant spraying of chemical pesticides. Neem oil or petroleum-based oils can be used and should thoroughly cover the plants, particularly the undersides of leaves. Recent research has also indicated the potential of using biocontrol agents such as beneficial isolated bacterial strains (Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia) as a means of reducing the incidence of the virus.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. There are no known methods for preventing or reducing cotton leaf curl virus. Chemical control in the form of insecticides can be used to control the whitefly population, such as imadacloprid or dinotefuran. Insecticides should be approached with caution however, because excessive usage of insecticides has caused many whitefly species to become resistant to them. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring, be sure to rotate between insecticides.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the cotton leaf curl virus, which is primarily transmitted through whiteflies. The spread of the disease is in part determined by prevailing winds, which will indicate how far the whiteflies can travel. Whiteflies are most problematic in the mid- to late season. The disease is also associated with shelters, such as trees. Since the disease is not seed-borne, the virus persists in the landscape via alternative hosts (such as tobacco and tomato) and weeds. Some additional factors that can favor development of the disease are recent rainfall, infected transplants, and the presence of weeds. The virus is also most likely to spread under a temperature range of 25-30ºC. In nurseries, cotton plants are most prone to infection during the seedling and vegetative stages.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse certified disease-free seeds and ensure transplants are healthy.\\nControl whitefly populations and protect seedlings in particular from them.\\nEnsure a weed-free field and surroundings.\\nPractice crop rotation by not planting cotton near alternative hosts.\\nPlow under or burn all plant debris after harvest.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Cherry Leaf Spot\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms vary slightly depending on the species of tree affected. In early summer, round purple to brownish blurred spots appear on the upper side of older leaves. The spots are typically 1-3mm in diameter and turn reddish brown over time. At later stages of the disease, the spots gradually merge to form larger lesions that can cover a large portion of the lamina. In some hosts, the necrotic part of the leaf lesion falls out, resulting in a shot-hole effect. On the lower side of leaves small red to white spots, mainly bound to the leaf veins, can be observed. Over time, they develop into yellowish or white spore cushions that are visible to the naked eye. Leaves will turn entirely yellow and can shed prematurely. Severe infections can lead to a total defoliation by midsummer, with the consequent effect on the development of fruits, which can become soft and immature, or ripen unevenly.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological control solution seems to be available against this disease. Please contact us if you know of any. Treatments with organic fungicides include formulations containing copper salts such as copper hydroxide or copper sulfate may provide some protection against leaf spot infection. Fungicides work best if combined with sanitation of the field.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Preventive measures are essential to control the disease but ultimately fungicides are required to maximize yield and quality. Five to seven applications are recommended, starting 2 weeks after bloom, depending on disease pressure. The most common active ingredients used to control cherry leaf spot include chlorothalonil, captan, strobilurins and several fungicides such as fenbuconazole, tebuconazole, myclobutanil. The alternation of active ingredients provides the best protection against the generation of resistant fungi.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nCherry leaf spot is caused by the fungus Bolumeriella jaapii, which can affect, besides cherry, plum and apricot trees. The fungus overwinters on fallen leaves on the orchard floor. In spring, when temperatures are above 6°C, the fungus germinates and produces spores that are spread by wind or rain. Leaves remain susceptible throughout the growing season. The infection cycle can be repeated several times during a single season, depending on environmental conditions, particularly leaf wetness. For example, at temperatures below 10°C and above 30 °C, the fungus needs 28 hours of leaf wetness for a successful infection. The corresponding time interval at temperatures around 20°C is 5 hours. This explains why serious damage usually occurs in years with numerous rainy periods throughout late spring and summer. Trees become more susceptible to stress (for example frost), and blossom and leaf production may be reduced for at least the two subsequent years.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse more resistant varieties, if available for the crop.\\nSelect a planting sight that is always exposed to direct sunlight and has good air circulation.\\nProper pruning to open the canopy will increase sunlight penetration and air circulation.Add plant fortifiers to create a balanced nutrition supply.\\nProvide a good drainage to the field.\\nCheck the plants for any sign of disease after the leaves are completely unfolded.\\nCollect and destroy fallen leaves in late autumn.'},\n",

The net form starts as pinpoint brown lesions which elongate and produce thin, dark brown streaks along and across the leaf blades, creating a distinctive net-like pattern. Older lesions continue to elongate along leaf veins and are often surrounded by a yellow margin. In the beginning the spots are small solid brown oval lesions, surrounded by yellow edges. Later on, the spots may grow to light or dark brown blotches of 3-6 mm in diameter. The ear can also be infected. Small brown streaks, without the netted appearance, develop on the glumes, causing reduced yields and shriveled seeds.

Foliar fungicides containing triazole and strobilurin are effective in controlling both forms of net blotch. Avoid using tebuconazole. In high rainfall environments it may be necessary to apply two sprays. Whenever possible, rotate fungicides with different modes of action, which will reduce the risk of development of resistance. Seed dressings are only effective against net-form net blotch.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nNet blotch is caused by the fungus Pyrenophora teres. It overwinters on crop residues and volunteer plants. The disease can also arise from infected seed, but usually with minor incidence. The disease spreads by air-borne spores and rain splashes. Primary crop infection occurs after approximately six hours of moist conditions at temperatures between 10ºC and 25ºC. Dispersal of spores via wind happens 14 to 20 days after primary infection whenever conditions are favorable. Severe infection reduces green leaf area and plant productivity, and can kill the leaves prematurely. The fungus also grows into the stem.

The first symptom of blossom blight is the withering of flowers, which turn brown and often remain affixed to the twig in a gummy mass. Infections may extend into the twig and can girdle it. If shoots do not die off completely, the infection is carried over from the blossom to the developing leaves and fruits. Leaves dry out but remain on the tree throughout the whole year. Fruit rot can affect fruits hanging on trees as well as stored ones. Soft, brown patches appear on the fruits. As the patches grow, white or yellow pustules develop on the tan areas, sometimes in concentric circles. The fruits gradually dehydrate, rot, and mummify on the tree. Stored fruits may not develop pustules and may turn completely black.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe eradication of the wounding agent is the most effective ways of controlling the fruit rot phase. Control of insects and birds that serve as vectors or that inflict wounds on fruits is one way to reduce the incidence of the disease. Birds may be controlled with scarecrows. Wasp nests should be sought out and destroyed. Particular care is needed in packing and storage of fruit because the fungus can spread between fruits.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Cherries are the least susceptible stone fruit to this disease and preventive sprays may not be needed unless the weather is particularly favorable for infection or the orchard has a history of this disease. One of two applications of fungicides based on difenoconazole and fenhexamid can be effective. At a later stage of infection, it is not possible to eliminate the fungus. Use a protective fungicide after adverse weather conditions such as hail. Insect control may be an important consideration because Monilia laxa prefers infection through wounds.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nMonilia laxa can infect many hosts, especially stone fruits like almond, apple, apricot, cherry, peach, pear, plum or quince. This fungus overwinters in dry leaves or mummified fruits hanging from the trees and its spores are spread via wind, water or insects. The infection is favored by the presence of wounds on fruits (birds, insects) or by the contact between healthy and infected parts. High humidity, rain or dew and moderate temperatures (15° to 25°C) during bloom favor the infection process. The development of pustules on fruits is particularly conspicuous in these conditions.

There are different natural enemies that can be used effectively against aphid species such as parasitoid, parasitic or predatory insects and fungi species. A dry heat treatment of root suckers at 40°C for one day may also help to reduce the risk of infection.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Direct treatment of viral diseases is not possible, but alternative hosts and vectors can be controlled to a certain degree. If insecticides are needed, products containing demeton-methyl, dimethoat and malathion can be used as foliar spray applications. Please bear in mind that the listed chemicals have a toxic to very toxic impact on human health as well as on animals.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptom are caused by a virus. The primary infection usually occurs through infested plant material such as root suckers used as transplants. Aphid species serve as vectors for secondary infection and spread the virus particles to other plants or fields. Cucumber and tomato are dormant host plants for the virus, that is they can harbor the viral particles without developing any symptoms. The infection is favored by specific weather conditions such as frequent rainfalls, for example during the late and post monsoon periods. The disease is a serious treat to banana plants and may lead to heavy yield losses.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nComply with strict quarantine measures if in place.\\nUse healthy planting material from reliable sources.\\nDo not plant susceptible varieties within the plantation.\\nCheck your plants or field for any sign of the disease and vectors such as aphids.\\nDo not cultivate alternative hosts such as plants from the tomato and cucumber family, maize, and species of the genus Panicum and Digitalia in the vicinity of banana plantations.\\nUse barrier crops such as brown hem (Crotalaria juncea) in three of four rows to monitor entering aphids from infected fields.\\nRemove infected plants from field, and destroy them by digging or burning them.\\nDo not spread suckers between different fields.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Helicoverpa Caterpillar\\n\\nSymptoms\\nWhitish to brown eggs can be found in clusters around floral structures and young leaves on upper canopy. Feeding damage can be found on any plant tissue but are most likely on flowers and bolls/ears/fruits/pods, depending on the host plant. Young larvae scrape the foliage, growing points or the fruiting structure, causing little damage. Older ones bore into flowers or the young boll/ear/fruit/pod, hollowing it from the inside, damaging seeds and making it unfit for marketing. Frass is visible around the feeding holes. The growth of secondary pathogens on the wounds lead to the rotting of the affected tissues.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTrichogramma wasps (T. chilonis or T. brasiliensis) can be introduced coinciding with flower initiation to attack the eggs. Microplitis, Heteropelma and Netelia wasps parasitize the larvae. Predatory bugs (big-eyed bug, glossy shield bug and spined predatory shield bug), ants, spiders, earwigs, crickets and flies attack the larvae and should thus be promoted. Apply bio-insecticides based on spinosad, nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV), Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana or Bacillus thuringiensis to control the larvae. Botanical products, such as Neem oil, Neem seed kernel extracts (NSKE 5%), chili or garlic may be applied as foliar sprays at bud initiation stage.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Selective insecticide treatment is the best option to rid the field from the pest without affecting beneficial insects. Monitor for eggs and larvae is crucial as the caterpillars become increasingly resilient to insecticidal treatment. Products based on chlorantraniliprole, chloropyrifos, cypermethrin, alpha- and zeta-cypermethrin, emamectin benzoate, esfenvalerate, flubendiamide, or indoxacarb can be used (usually @ 2.5 ml/l). The first application should be at the flowering stage and followed by sprays at 10-15 days interval. Chemical treatment may not be viable in low-value crops.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the caterpillar of Helicoverpa armigera, a common pest in a number of crops. H. armigera one of the most destructive pests in agriculture. Moths are light brown, with a wingspan of 3-4 cm. They generally have yellow to orange or brown forewings mottled with darker patterns. Hindwings are whitish, with dark veins and dark elongated spots on the lower edges. Females lay spherical, whitish eggs singly or in clusters on flowers or leaf surfaces, mainly on the top canopy. The larvae are olive green to dark reddish-brown, depending on the maturation stage. Their body is speckled with little black spots and they have a dark head. At later maturity stages, lines and bands develop along their back and flanks. As they reach maturity, they pupate in the soil. The population normally peaks during fruit/pod/boll development, which results in high yield loss.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse resistant or tolerant varieties if available.\\nPlant early to avoid population peaks of the pest.\\nLeave sufficient distance between plants.\\nProvide uncultivated marginal areas to break the life cycle.\\nPlace bird perches to attract birds that feed on the caterpillars.\\nUse trap crops such as marigold (Tagitus erecta) every 5 or 6 rows.\\nUse light or pheromone traps to monitor or mass-catch the moths.\\nAvoid water stress by providing good drainage.\\nMonitor plants for the presence of eggs and damage to flowers, fruit pods or bolls.\\nHand-pick larvae and leaves or plants with eggs.\\nRemove infected plants from fields as well as weeds in and around the field.\\nClear all harvest residues after each cropping cycle.\\nPlow deeply after harvesting to expose the pupae for natural predators and solar rays.\\nAvoid monocultures and implement intercropping with beneficial plants.'},\n",

The fungus survives in plant residues in the soil. When the conditions are favorable, it produces spores that are distributed to new plants by wind and rain splashes. It germinates on leaves and can complete its life cycle (from infection to new spore production) within 72 hours.

       "  'data': 'Purple Blotch of Onion\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms depend principally on ambient relative humidity (RH). Small, irregular, sunken and whitish specks first appear on older leaves and flower stalks. If RH remains low, no further development is observed. However, at high RH these lesions develop into elliptical brown or purple blotches, with concentric light and dark zones on their central area. Over time, these lesions can spread to several centimeters long and have a yellowish border. Lesions may coalesce and girdle the leaf or flower stalk, causing wilting and death. Bulbs can also be attacked, mainly at the neck, if wounded during harvest. Storage symptoms appear as a dark yellow to reddish, spongy rot of the outer or inner scales of the bulbs. Onion, garlic and leek may be affected by this disease.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo date, no effective biological control for this disease is available. The antagonistic fungus Cladosporium herbarum has been used to inhibit the pathogen Alternaria porri on contact in vivo, reducing the infection by 66.6%. Other fungi were much less effective, for example Penicillium sp. (54%). A mixture of several antagonists can cause a reduction of up to 79.1 %. However, no commercial products have been developed on these findings so far. Aqueuos extracts of Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Datura stramonium (jimsonweed) can be used for the biocontrol of purple blotch.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of both preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Most commercial onion crops must be protected from purple blotch by using repeated applications of protective fungicides. Solutions based on the fungicides boscalid, chlorothalonil, fenamidone and mancozeb (all @ 0.20 - 0.25%) can be sprayed preventively at fortnightly intervals starting one month after transplanting. Copper fungicides are registered for control of purple blotch, but are not highly effective. Alternate fungicides from different families to avoid the development of resistance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nPurple blotch is caused by the fungus Alternaria porri. It survives the winter on infected crop debris or near soil surface. It resumes its life cycle with the production of spores as warm, wet conditions occur in the spring. Wind, irrigation water or splashing rain disperse the spores to healthy plants and fields. The disease occurs under favorable conditions of temperature 21-30ºC and 80-90% relative humidity. The incidence of the disease and the intensity of the symptom also depends on the season and the conditions of the site. When it occurs together with Stemphylium blight, the damage can be serious. Resistance to purple blotch is mainly due to the thickness of the cuticle. This resistance can be reduced by wounding during field work or after sand-storm blast, for example.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use seeds from certified sources.\\nIf possible, sow and transplant early in the season.\\nChoose resistant varieties if available.\\nPlow field 2-3 times between seasons to expose the fungus to solar radiation.\\nIncrease the space between plants when transplanting.\\nFertilize generously with nitrogen and phosphorous to have strong and healthy plants.\\nControl weeds in an around the fields.\\nRemove debris and volunteer plants after harvest.\\nTake care not to injure plants during field work.\\nCrop rotations of 2-3 years prevent the pathogen populations from building up to high levels.\\nStore bulbs at 1-3 °C and humidity 65-70% in a well-aerated cooler.\\nControl onion thrips, as plants weakened by them are more susceptible to disease.'},\n",

Infected plant parts might die prematurely.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere is no effective biological control method available for this disease. If you know of any successful method to reduce the incidence or the severity of the symptoms, please contact us.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Foliar fungicides can protect the quality of seeds if applied near the beginning of seed formation. Fungicides applied from pod set through late pod stages will lower seed infection incidence. Infected seeds should be treated before sowing.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nStem blight is caused by the fungal species of Diaporthe phaseolorum, often also referred to as Phomopsis sojae. The fungi survive in both infected seeds and crop residues during winter. Infected seeds will be shrivelled, cracked and covered with white mycelium. Severely infected seed may not germinate. Prolonged periods of warm, wet weather during pod development and maturation favour the spread of the disease from the pod to the seeds. Very wet conditions favour stem infections during pod filling stages. The pathogen can cause significant yield losses and reduces seed quality.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse high quality and disease-free seeds for planting.\\nAvoid planting soybean on a field that was previously affected by stem blight.\\nExamine plants every two weeks from pod fill to harvest maturity stage for the presence of stem blight.\\nKeep your field free from alternative host weeds such as velvetleaf and pigweed.\\nDelaying harvest increases the risk of stem blight because plants are likely to be exposed to cool and wet conditions that favour disease development.\\nHarvesting on time and doing proper tillage can reduce the amount of inoculum.\\nPractice crop rotation with non-host crops such as corn or wheat.'},\n",

While feeding on mango trees the hoppers produce sugary fluids (honeydew) that attract other insects and present an ideal culture medium for the growth of sooty mold. The fungal growth on leaves affects photosynthesis, impacting tree vigor and reducing its productivity. Mango hoppers lay their eggs into the leaves and flower stems of mango trees, which may also cause damage to the tissues. Mango hoppers can become a serious pest, with crop losses of up to 50%.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBiological control agents such as the predators Mallada boninensis and Chrysopa lacciperda and the egg parasite Polynema sp. can reduce hopper populations. Alternatively, affected mango trees can be treated with oil-based sprays containing the fungi Beauveria bassiana or Metarhizium anisopliae. Treatment at rates of 2-3 times per week is recommended. Sprays based on neem oil (3%) can also reduce Idioscopus spp. populations by up to 60%.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

The three main symptoms are: decline (\"tristeza\") of the tree, development of pits in the trunk and stem and yellowing of leaves. Decline includes chlorotic leaves and general dieback of the infected tree. It may be slow, lasting several months to years after the first symptoms are noticed. The decline may also be quick, resulting in host death just a few days after the first symptoms are noticed. Susceptible plants develop a large number of pits on both their trunks and their stems. Some varieties develop rind-oil spots, or brown spots with gumming on the fruit.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSome field experiments with parasitoid wasps or gall midges are ongoing, which could naturally control some of the aphids in citrus groves. Use commercially available formulations (natural pyrethrum, fatty acids ), insecticidal soaps or horticultural oils (plant or fish oils) to control populations. Aphids can also be wiped out by spraying the leaves of the plant with a mild solution of water and a few drops of detergent.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventives measures and biological treatments if available. Viruses can not be directly controlled by chemical options. Check the database for chemical control of aphids.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the citrus tristeza virus, a particularly virulent and devastating virus in citrus groves. It is mainly transmitted in a non-persistent manner by the black citrus aphid, Toxoptera citricida. This aphid can acquire the virus while feeding on infected plants for 5-60 minutes, but it loses the ability to transmit it after 24 hours. Other insects of this family can also contribute to its spreading (for example the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii). Grafting with contaminated material may also contribute to the carrying of the virus to other farms. The severity of the symptoms depends on the virulence of the virus. Some types may not produce noticeable symptoms. Other types are causing severe decline and death of the tree or deep pits in the trunk and stem. The optimum temperatures for virus infection and multiplication are 20-25°C.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCheck quarantine regulation in the area to avoid transmission of the disease.\\nUse plant material from certified sources.\\nUse resistant varieties (some hybrid species are tolerant to the virus).\\nKeep nurseries and greenhouses free of insect vectors.\\nDo not transport suspicious citrus material to other farms.\\nCheck the citrus grove regularly for signs of the disease.\\nMake sure you are familiar with symptoms and the insects that spread it.\\nRemove and destroy infected trees.\\nUse companion planting to keep aphids away from your plants in the first place.'},\n",

While feeding, they produce abundant quantities of sticky honeydew that drops on and coats nearby leaves and fruits with a thick black mass. The honeydew may attract attendant ants and is rapidly colonized by sooty molds that thrive on the sugary deposits, thus reducing photosynthetic rates. Badly affected leaves may fall prematurely. The older insects are conspicuous as dark gray or brown-to-black lumps on leaf undersides and stems.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSome parasitic wasps, including Scutellista caerulea, Diversinervus elegans and Metaphycus helvolus, as well as some species of ladybirds (Chilocorus bipustulatus) can decimate black scale populations in the right settings. To protect resident natural enemies, avoid using broad-spectrum persistent insecticides in landscapes. Canola oil or biopesticides of fungal origins can also be applied to control black scale.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Use double-sided sticky traps, suspended in the tree canopy, to assess the presence of crawlers. If the threshold is exceeded, narrow-ranged mineral white oil sprays or the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen can be applied. Sprays with products containing chlorpyrifos may also be used.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBlack scale adult females are about 5 mm in diameter and dark brown or black with a prominent H-shaped ridge on the back. They migrate to twigs and branches later in autumn and remain there for the rest of their lives. Young scales (crawlers) are yellow to orange and are found on the leaves and twigs of trees. They disperse by walking or sometimes wind-borne and settle along the leaf veins on the underside of leaves or on young shoots. They thrive in dense, unpruned portions of trees, mostly on the northern side. By contrast, open, airy trees rarely support populations of black scale. They have one or two generations per year in unfavorable settings, reaching two in irrigated orchards. Alternative hosts include citrus, pistachio, pear, stone fruit trees, and pomegranate.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the olive trees regularly for infestations of black scale.\\nPruning the canopy adequately may improve air circulation and hinder the life cycle of the black scale.\\nIn the case of light infestation, hand removing of plant parts or crushing of the insects can be effective.\\nRemove infested tree parts and burn or deep-bury them in distance to the orchard.\\nAvoid the excessive use of pesticides, as this can negatively affect the populations of natural enemies.\\nManage to protect ants by circling trunks with a sticky material.\\nPrune adequately to prevent bridges between plants.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Calcium Deficiency\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms are primarily visible in the rapidly growing tissues like new shoots and leaves. Young shoots are poorly developed and over time their number is reduced. Initially, the new or intermediary leaves may show randomly scattered chlorotic stains in the limb. If not amended, they start to curl downward or upward and their edges take gradually a necrotic and scorched aspect. Mature and older leaves are generally unaffected. The root system develops poorly and plants have a tendency to wilt and show stunted growth. With a severe deficiency, flowers can abort, and the growing point of new leaves appear burnt or simply die. Fruits are smaller and unsavory, and in the case of cucumber, pepper and tomato may develop rot at the blossom end. Seeds have a lower germination rate.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nFor small farmers or gardeners, crushed eggshells ground very finely and mixed with a weak acid (vinegar) can be used. Alternatively, apply calcium-rich substances such as algal limestone, basalt flour, burnt lime, dolomite, gypsum, and slag lime.

Calcium is not mobile in the plant and its absorption is tightly linked to the uptake and transport of water in the plant. That explains why new leaves are first to show deficiency symptoms. Heavy soils and irrigated soils are good at dissolving calcium and bringing it to the plant. However, sandy soils, with a poor water retention capacity, are prone to drought and can limit its uptake. Allowing the soil to dry out too much between watering can also cause the symptoms. Soils with low pH, high salinity or soils rich in ammonium can also be problematic. High air humidity or flooding of soils can slow down the transport of water to tissues, and therefore less calcium is absorbed.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose varieties that are better at mining calcium from the soil.\\nMake sure to test the soil pH and lime if necessary to get within the optimal range between 7.0 and 8.5.\\nReduce the use of ammonium-based fertilizers to avoid insufficient calcium availability in the soil.\\nDo not over-fertilize with nitrogen during early fruit development.\\nBe careful not to injure the roots if working near the plants.\\nEnsure frequent watering, but do not over-water.\\nAdd organic matter to the soil, for example, manure or organic mulch or compost.\\nGreen mulch (straw, decomposed sawdust) or plastic mulch can help the soil to retain moisture.\\nMonitor the field regularly and remove fruits with symptoms.'},\n",

Plants contaminated during the vegetative stage show stunted growth, wilt and chlorosis. During later plant stages, the fungi can infect the ears, insect lesions or mechanical injuries can serve as entry points. Mechanical injuries can occur during field work or harvest. Elevated temperatures and high humidities lead to the growth of a moldy blue-green growth on the cob surface and on the kernels. The infected kernels are typically bleached and streaked and are also rotting internally (a symptom called blue eye). Sometimes this mold growth is only visible after harvest or during storage. The rotting kernels can lead to yield or post-harvest losses.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSorry, we don't know of any alternative treatment against Penicillium spp. .

If really necessary, fungicides containing mancozeb or captan can be applied.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe fungi Penicillium spp. are airborne and ubiquitous in the environment. They are capable of growing at low water availability and survive in infected plant debris in the soil or in storage facilities. They are usually spread through wind and rain splashes and infect ears through wounds. They thrive in high humidities and elevated temperatures. The disease is more common during flower and fruit development. The first symptoms might become visible only during storage.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse seeds from healthy plant or from certified sources.\\nPlant resistant or tolerant varieties.\\nAdjust sowing time so that grain filling takes place in times of low rainfall and low humidity.\\nLeave sufficient space between plants to allow for good ventilation.\\nKeep the field clear of weeds and alternative hosts.\\nTake great care not to damage the crops during handling.\\nHarvest as soon as possible to avoid damage.\\nMaintain seed moisture below 14% during storage to avoid fungal growth on kernels.\\nInfected grains should not be used as seeds in subsequent seasons.\"},\n",

       "  'data': 'White Rot\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe infection can occur at any growth stage but it is usually first visible on older plants. It is characterized by the yellowing of the leaves, starting from the tip and progressing downwards. Wilting and later dieback can ensue. When these above-ground symptoms are evident, the pathogen has already colonized the roots, bulb, stems and leaf sheaths. White fungal growth is often visible at the soil line and is a sign of the decay of the roots. When pulled out, the bulb show white fluffy fungus growth, often at its base, a sign of advanced rotting. Tiny, black and roundish specks form amidst the white mold. The main roots are gradually destroyed and may be missing. Secondary roots may develop and extend horizontally, providing a direct path for the contamination of other plants. Plants can decline over a period of just some days to a weeks. This explains why the symptoms appear in clusters in the field.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere are several levels of control using biological methods, mainly using antagonistic fungi. Species of Trichoderma, Fusarium, Gliocladium or Chaetomium, for example, are parasite of the white rot fungus and can be used to reduce its growth. Other fungi, for example Trichoderma harzianum, Teratosperma oligocladum or Laterispora brevirama are also also very effective. A treatment with garlic extract can be used to stimulate the development of the fungus and the production of spores when the fields are barren. This reduces the incidence of the disease in later seasons. Garlic bulb needs to be unwrapped, crushed and mixed up with 10l of water. Then it can be added to the field at a rate of 10l per 2sqm. The ideal temperatures for the application is around 15-18°C because it favors the fungus.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Particularly in case of white rot disease cultural and biological methods can be very significant in reducing the infection. If fungicides are needed, products containing tebuconazole, penthiopyrad, fludioxonil or iprodione can be used as soil applications before planting, or as foliar spray application after planting. The application method depends on the active agent used for the treatment and needs to be checked before.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nWhite rot disease is caused by the soilborne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. Plants most commonly are infected through the soil, where the dormant pathogen can survive for periods of up to 20 years. The severity of the disease is strongly associated with the amount of of fungus in the soil. Once established, it is almost impossible to get rid of the pathogen. The life cycle and development of the fungus is favored by Allium root extracts. The appearance of the disease is strongly associated with cool (10-24°C) and moist soil conditions and can be spread by the fungal underground mold network, flood water, tools and plant material. The white rot disease is one of the major threats in onion and can lead to heavy yield losses.Disinfect the tools and equipment before working on another field.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant less vulnerable varieties, for example red onions.\\nUse healthy seeds or planting material from a certified source.\\nCheck the base of the bulb for any sign of mold before planting.\\nIf no certified planting material is available, use seeds instead of bulbs is recommended.\\nEnsure a good drainage to avoid water logging as a spread mechanism.\\nAvoid excessive fertilization with nitrogen.\\nCheck the plants or fields regularly for any sign of the disease.\\nRemove infected plants and destroy them by burning.\\nDo not compost infected plants to avoid further spread of the disease.\\nWash or disinfect equipment and tools carefully before operations.\\nPlan a crop rotation with non-host plants.\\nPlow deep and expose he soil to solar radiation.'},\n",

Further symptoms are underdeveloped, light seeds that fail to ripen properly. High infestations can cause a severe loss in quality of the harvest due to the stained lint, hence the common name cotton stainer. When feeding on other host plants like okra, common symptoms are a pungent smell and greasy secretions.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIn Africa, some species of parasitic mites are found on the bugs, which become sluggish and soon die. Some spiders also attack this pest. Foliar sprays with diluted neem oil (5%), entomopathogenic fungi, like Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae have also shown some effect on the control of populations.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. The foliar application of insecticide formulations containing chlorpyrifos, esfenvalerate, bifenthrin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin or indoxacarb works against the pink bollworm and has shown to reduce dusky cotton stainer population as well. However, because this insect usually infests fields late in the season, chemical control is often not feasible due to the residues on the harvest. Resistance to insecticides has also been described.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the dusty cotton stainer, Oxycarenus hyalinipennis, a polyphagous insect that may be a severe pest of cotton. Adults reach a length of 4-5 mm and are dusky brown with transparent wings. Males are slightly smaller than females. Whitish-yellow eggs are laid in groups of up to 4 on the lint of open bolls, close to the seeds. Nymphs are up to 2.5 mm long and change their color from pink to brown during the different stages of their life cycle, which lasts about 40-50 days in total.

These deposits, produced by the nymphs, can sometimes be mistaken for those found during mealybugs or the cottony cushion scale infestations (and which are more damaging pests). In case of doubt, it may help to know, that contrarily to those, the planthopper will jumped when disturbed. Adults and nymphs have mouthparts that are adapted for piercing plant tissues and sucking the sap. Adults are often seen feeding gregariously, excreting the excess sugar as honeydew, which favors the growth of sooty mold. Dense populations of this insect may cause the stunting of new shoots and the weakening of the trees, either directly or through the growth of the opportunistic fungi. In other susceptible plant hosts, symptoms may be more dramatic, including chlorosis and necrosis of the leaves, withering of shoot tips and malformation and shriveling of seeds.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nA parasitic wasp of the dryinid family, Psilodryinus typhlocybae, lay its eggs on the nymphs of Metcalfa pruinosa and can help to reduce populations. Soap solutions cause the young nymph stages of the pest to slide on the leaves and to fall to the ground. Moreover, it is ideal solution to wash the honeydew present on the leaves, which is later colonize by sooty mold. However, in the absence of insecticide treatments the insects will return.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments, if available. Chemical control of adults is difficult because of their mobility. A way to control dense populations might be the timely application of insecticides to control the nymphs. The control of sooty mold is generally more useful as this can be the most damaging factor. Where authorized, foliar or fruit sprayings with solutions containing deltamethrin or pyrethroids at the edge of the field can give a good control of the insect.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the adults and nymphs of the planthopper Metcalfa pruinosa, which has a broad range of tree hosts, among them citrus. It is a highly adaptable insect, that can thrive in a multitude of environments. They can disperse over short distances by flight and are extremely attracted to light. Bad field practices and human intervention can also be a decisive factor in their long distance spreading. Adults are brown to gray and have characteristic prominent, bright orange eyes and triangular forewings with scattered whitish spots. They may easily be mistaken for moths at first glance. Adults and nymphs can be covered with an abundant bluish white wax, that can take the form of dense white tufts of hair in the latter. Females lay about 100 eggs in the autumn, usually on pre-existing wounds on the bark of twigs, or on holes dug in softer bark. When conditions are favorable during the spring, the egg hatch and nymphs start to feed on plant tissues.

The early instar larva feeds on chlorophyll under the surface of leaves gregariously. In later stages, it eats leaves from the margin in a solitary manner. Generally, larvae prefer mature leaves, but under severe infestation also top shoots are affected. The Bihar hairy caterpillar attacks pulses, oilseeds, cereals and certain vegetables and jute in various countries, causing severe economic damage. The extent of yield loss varies with the infestation intensity and weather conditions as the species favors temperatures from 18 to 33°C for development.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlan a deep summer plowing to rid the soil of pupae.\\nAvoid sowing before the monsoon.\\nUse optimum seed rate, not more nor less.\\nAdequate plant spacing should be provided.\\nApply well-rotted manures.\\nIntercrop either with (early maturing) pigeon pea, some varieties of maize or sorghum.\\nMonitor fields regularly for signs of the pest (egg masses, caterpillars and for any damages).\\nAdopt an appropriate method of weeding either by herbicides or mechanically in the field and surrounding area.\\nCollect infested plant parts and destroy them away from the field.\\nBuild perches and open space for birds that will feed on the larvae.\\nControl the use of broad-range insecticides, as this can affect beneficial insects.\\nRemove plant residues or volunteer plants after harvest.\\nFollow with a crop rotation of non-host crops like rice or maize.'},\n",

Gradually these lesions will turn grayish and appear on younger leaves, too. As the disease progresses, they enlarge into elongated, rectangular lesions that run parallel to the leaf veins. In optimal conditions (warm temperatures, high humidity and wet leaves), they can coalesce and engulf the whole leaf. If this happens before grain filling there can be considerable yield losses. The leaf blight can weaken the plants and sometimes soften the stalks, leading to lodging.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological control is available to control this disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Foliar fungicide treatment is a way to manage the disease if it occurs at early stages but it has to be weighted against the weather conditions, the potential yield loss and the susceptibility of the plant. Fungicides containing pyraclostrobin and strobilurin, or combinations of azoxystrobin and propiconazole, prothioconazole and trifloxystrobin work well to control the fungus.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe gray leaf spot disease is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis. It survives in plant residues in the soil for long periods of time. During the spring, the spores are carried onto the lower leaves by rain splashes and wind. Its lifecycle is favored by elevated temperatures (25 to 30°C), high humidity (dews, fogs) and leaf wetness for prolonged periods of time. Hot, dry weather hinders its development.

Sometimes their centers become necrotic and fall out, leaving ragged \"shot-hole\". Severely infected leaves become chlorotic or scorched and may drop early, causing defoliation. Small, round, sunken spots form on the fruit, sometimes only on the side exposed to the sun. They are olive-brown to black and frequently surrounded by a water-soaked margin.

Dosage must be reduced progressively to avoid damage to leaves.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas arboricola, whose common hosts are peach, nectarine, prune, plum, and apricot. It overwinters on buds, cracks of the stem or in leaf scars. In spring, when conditions are favorable, it resumes its growth and colonize the rest of the twigs, exuding bacterial ooze as it does so. The ooze is dispersed by dropping dew, wind or splashing rain and carried to healthy twigs, fruits and leaves. The natural pores on leaves or the lenticels on bark are the entry points for the bacteria. Warm temperatures (21 to 29 °C) with light rains, heavy dews, and windy weather are most conducive for disease development and spread. By contrast, the growth of the bacterium and the infection process is impaired when the weather is hot and dry.

The spots can be surrounded by circular, brownish lesions with dark edges, commonly called \"fish-eye\". The circular, oval, sometime angular or irregular spots can coalesce and form stripes up to 10 mm long. The whole leaf can be covered with spots and surrounding leaf material dries up. Symptoms appear first on lower leaves, spreading to upper leaves. Under severe infestation the spots also appear on husks and leaf sheaths. Leaves may die off completely after 21 to 30 days.

       "  'data': 'Maize Earworm\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe maize earworm prefers the fruiting stage of the host but will also attack the foliage. Larvae feed on the silk hairs and then bore themselves into the ear, where they start to eat up the kernels. They can be seen feeding around or down the ear creating a track of damaged kernels and leaving a long line of brown frass. They are cannibalistic so usually per cob there is just one of them present. Numerous ragged holes appear at the tip of the cob and on developing leaf blades. Because they feed on floral structures and kernels and interfere with pollination and grain filling, the yield can be severely compromised. The damage creates an ideal environment for infection with other diseases.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nParasitoid Trichogramma and Telenomus wasps can help to control the population to a certain degree by infesting the eggs of Helicoverpa zea. Larval parasitoids also exist. Other beneficial insects, such as green lacewings, big-eyed bug or damsel bugs are predators of eggs and small larvae. Some beneficial nematodes also work when injected at the tip of the ear. The fungal pathogen Nomuraea rileyi and the nuclear polyhedrosis virus also reduce populations of Helicoverpa zea. Application of bio-insecticides containing Bacillus Thuringiensis or spinosad work fine if they are applied in a timely manner. Mineral oil or neem oil applied to the silk of each ear can also prevent corn earworm invasions.\\nChemical Control\\nUse an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological control whenever available. In the field, chemical control is rarely recommended because the larvae hide inside the cobs and are not exposed to the treatment. Insecticides containing pyrethroid, spinetoram, esfenvalerate or chlorpyrifos can be used.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nMaize earworms overwinter as pupae in the soil, at depth of 5 to 10 cm. Robust adult moths start to emerge at the beginning of spring and are mostly active during the evening and night, more so with increasing temperatures. They have light-brown forewings, sometimes with olive shading. A wavy dark-brown band runs a few millimeters from the margins. Hindwings are white-gray and have a broad black band with a yellowish mark at the edge. Females lay white dome-shape eggs singly on fresh silk or foliage. The larvae vary in color (from pale green to reddish or brown), moderately hairy and about 3.7 mm long. They have tan or orange heads and a body covered with small black spots that correspond to microscopic spines. As they mature, two yellowish stripes develop on their flanks.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resistant or tolerant plants.\\nPlant early to avoid peak populations of the moths.\\nMonitor the presence of moths and mass-catch them with light or pheromone traps.\\nKeep the use of insecticides to a minimum to conserve populations of beneficial insects.\\nCompanion cropping with plants that attract the moths might work.\\nControl weeds in and around the field.\\nTill the soil in-between seasons to expose the pupae to weather, birds and other predators.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Banana Scab Moth\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe damage from the banana scab moths is primarily caused by the larval stage and principally confined to the fruits. The larvae concentrate their attack on fruit bunches still protected by bracts. At emergence, they start feeding on the inflorescences and the surface of the developing fruits, damaging them superficially and resulting in scars which quickly turn black. Over time, as the bract begin to lift and fall, they migrate down the bunch to younger and still shielded fruits. If they have no alternative, the larvae remain at the base of the bunch, feeding on male inflorescences, or on maturing fruits. Often a clear jelly-like substance, which appears to be associated only with banana scab moth feeding, is present at these sites. The cosmetic scabbing of the fruit cause makes them unsuitable for market.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo major parasite or predator have been identified against this pest. Some wasp parasites, spiders and other general predators provide a low level of natural control. The ant Tetramorium bicarinatum which is commonly found on plants and bunches can give some control of the banana scab moth. Biopesticides containing formulations of spinosad, the fungi Beauvaria bassiana or Metarhizium anisopliae or the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis can also be effective.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Formulations based on the active principles chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin, and bendiocarb are usually recommended for bunch injection. Treatments must be done when the bunch is still upright in the throat of the plant. Inject 20 to 40 ml of dilute insecticide at the right dose about a third of the way down from the top of the spear. Injections above or below this will either damage the fruit or not be effective.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the banana scab moth, Nacoleia octasema. Adults are light brown of yellowish-brown with black marks on wings. These short-lived moth (4-5 days) have twilight-active habits and mates in the early evening. During the day, they hide in trash and under old leaf axils. Females lay eggs on the emerging bunches or the surrounding leaves and bracts. After hatching, the larvae make their way to the bunch and commence feeding. The life cycle from egg-hatching to egg-laying is completed in 28 days. The banana scab moth favors moist and warm conditions, causing the worst damage during the wet season. The cooler and drier winter months are usually free of this insect, unless unseasonal rainfall occurs during this period. Research has shown adults do not mate and lay eggs under low humidity and dry conditions. It is one of the most economically damaging pests in banana and can cause up to 100% bunch damage if left uncontrolled.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChose resilient varieties, if available.\\nInspect freshly emerged bunches for the presence of damage and/or larvae.\\nPay special attention to the base of the bunch stalk and check for the presence of a clear jelly-like substance there.'},\n",

As the disease progresses, tiny brown fruiting bodies in the enlarged gray lesions can be seen using a magnifier or a microscope. Badly affected leaves die back from the tip as the blotches converge. After flowering, wet weather can lead to lesion development on the glumes. Symptoms often start at the tip, but whole areas may be covered with dark brown to dark purple lesions with ash gray areas ( “glume blotch”). Severe infections may result in lightweight, shriveled kernels.

If fungicides are needed, products containing difenoconazol, triadimenol or fluquinconazol can be applied. The application method varies depending on time of occurrence and cultivation type.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThis foliar disease is caused by the fungus Parastagonospora nodorum, which survives on wheat straw, infested seeds or on alternative host crops. The fungus is dispersed through water and requires about 12 to 18 hours of leaf wetness for infection. Older leaves near the soil are the first affected. Then, the fungus is dispersed via wind or rain-splashes to the upper parts of the plant and to neighboring crops. Late season infections could lead to glume blotch if the disease is moving up the canopy. It causes shriveled grains and reduces yield. Spores are spread by wind and can cover long distances to infect the seedlings in other fields later in the season. This leads to earlier infection of the following crops and to irregular emergence. The life cycle of the fungus is stopped at temperatures below 7°C. Optimal growth range is between 20°C and 27°C.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse seeds from healthy plant material or from certified pathogen-free sources.\\nUse tolerant or long straw varieties available in your area.\\nUse late maturing wheat varieties or plant later in the season.\\nUse an optimal sowing density at planting.\\nUse growth regulators at moderate levels and a balanced fertilization.\\nEnsure soil potassium levels are adequate for healthy plants.\\nCheck your plants or fields for any sign of disease after emergence.\\nEnsure a moderate application of herbicides.\\nPerform crop rotation with non-host crops.\\nPlow deep to bury plant residues under the surface.\\nRemove straw and other plant debris from field.\\nRemove volunteer plants.\"},\n",

Injury to pods is characterized by the presence of entry or exit holes where the larva has damaged the seed vessel. Usually one or two larvae can be found in each pod and the build-up of frass causes soft, brown, rotten patches on the surface. Seeds are either partially or entirely eaten, and if flowers and pods are not available, the larvae will feed on foliage.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPredators include some vertebrates, arthropods and birds. Parasite or parasitoids wasps of the species Bracon platynotae, Perisierola cellularis, and Zatropis tortricidis attack the larvae of the gold-banded Etiella moth, and can have a pronounced effect on its population.

Adult moths are nocturnal and have a light brown body with a bulging head and two long protuberant antennae. Forewings are brown-grayish with a characteristic glittering aspect and a white stripe that runs along the fore edge. A golden-orange band crosses the wing on both sides, thereby the common name \"gold-banded Etiella moth\". Hindwings are light gray, with dark venation and dark, long fringe. Females lay their eggs on blossom or on green fruits and larvae live inside the fruit, eating away the seeds, and easily passing from one bean to another. They are pale green to green with a brownish tinge and and orange head crowned with a black V shape and four black dots.

Then they feed inside the tubular folded leaf creating longitudinal whitish and transparent streaks on the blade. Sometimes, leaves are folded from tip to basal part. Presence of disc-shaped eggs laid singly or of fecal matter are also signs of infection.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nFive to six releases of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma chilonis (100,000 adults/ha) starting from 15 days after planting is effective and economical. Also the protection of natural enemies, like spiders, predatory beetles, frogs and dragon flies. Pathogenic fungi or bacteria and also some viruses provides good population control.

Other insecticides include alpha-cypermethrin, abamectin 2% to kill the larvae. Care should be taken not to use chemicals causing resurgence of the insect.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nRice leaffolders occur in all rice environments and are more abundant during the rainy seasons. High humidity, shady areas of the field, and the presence of grassy weeds from rice fields and surrounding borders favor the development of the pest. Expanded rice areas with irrigation systems, multiple rice cropping and insecticide-induced resurgences are important factors in the insect’s abundance.

Looking forward to hear from you.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBacterial panicle blight is seed-transmitted. The spread of the disease is temperature-dependent. Bacterial panicle blight tends to develop during hot, dry weather at later stages of the plant growth. Prevalence increases when daytime temperatures are above 32°C and night temperatures remain around 25°C or above. High nitrogen levels also favor the development of disease. Rice planted earlier in the spring tends to have less damage from bacterial panicle blight because of cooler temperatures at heading and grain filling.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nClean your field thoroughly from plant residues from the previous harvest.\\nPlant only certified, disease-free seeds.\\nChoose a rice variety with partial resistance if available.\\nPlant the crop earlier in the spring.\\nControl your fertilization program and do not exceed the recommended doses, especially for nitrogen.\\nAvoid overwatering.\\nMonitor the crop regularly and check for sick plants.\\nConsider crop rotation with non-host crops, like legumes.\"},\n",

Chewed pulp and sap material exudes from the entry hole when the fruits are larger than a lime. Fruits may split due to the activity of the borer. The larvae may then migrate to other fruits. Larvae are covered with a series of red and white rings and have a black collar and head. As they get older, they turn green-bluish. Initially, they feed on pulp, then on the seeds. They cause premature fruit drop, particularly in young fruits. Hundreds of young fruits can be found on the ground under heavily infested trees.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nYou can use neem extract (azadirachtin) formulations against D. albizonalis, applied at weekly intervals, starting when the mango is in flower and continuing for 2 months. Try to maintain natural enemy populations of the mango seed borer, e.g. the wasps Rychium attrisimum (feeding on the larvae) and Trichogramma chilonis and Trichogramma chilotreae which parasitize the eggs of the mango seed borer.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

They live for about a week and lay eggs in pairs at the base of fruit peduncles. Larvae enter the fruit and feed on pulp and seeds. Pupation takes place in 1-2 cm deep holes in the bark, which the larvae close with chewed bark particles, rendering them invisible. Adults hatch after 10-14 days and are nocturnal.

As infestation becomes more severe, leaves appear bronzed or silvery first and then become brittle, rip open between the leaf veins, and finally fall off. Spider mite eggs can be found on undersides of leaves. The spider mite itself is located there, nesting in a cocoon resembling webbing. Infected plants will be covered by a web spun by the spider mites. Shoot tips can become bald and as a result, side shoots start to grow. In cases of heavy damage, the quantity, as well as quality of fruits, is reduced.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIn case of minor infestation, simply wash off the mites and remove the affected leaves. Use preparations based on rapeseed, basil, soybean and neem oils to spray leaves thoroughly and reduce populations of T. urticae. Also try garlic tea, nettle slurry or insecticidal soap solutions to control the population. In fields, employ host-specific biological control with predatory mites (for example Phytoseiulus persimilis) or the biological pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis. A second spray treatment application 2 to 3 days after the initial treatment is necessary.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Spider mites are very difficult to control with acaricides because most populations develop resistance to different chemicals after a few years of use. Choose chemical control agents carefully so that they do not disrupt the population of predators. Insecticides based on wettable sulfur (3 g/l), spiromesifen (1 ml/l) or abamectin can be used for example (dilution in water). A second spray treatment application 2 to 3 days after the initial treatment is necessary.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by spider mites from the genus Tetranychus, mainly T. urticae and T. cinnabarinus. The adult female is 0.6 mm long, pale green with two darker patches on its oval body, and long hairs on the back. Overwintering females are reddish. In spring, the females lay globular and translucent eggs on the underside of the leaves. The nymphs are pale green with darker markings on the dorsal side. The mites protect themselves with a cocoon on the underside of the leaf blades. The spider mite thrives in dry and hot climates and will produce up to 7 generations in one year in these conditions.

Brownish larval frass is also visible around the holes. Larvae are tunneling across stems, causing serious damage and reducing the transport of water and nutrients to tissues. Leaves turn yellow and plant growth can be stunted. In serious infections, the weakening of the stem causes plants to break and fall over during windy weather or storms. The tissues rapidly become discolored and emit a foul odor because of the presence of opportunistic pathogens in the wounds. In the infested plants all life stages of the weevil are present throughout the year. Bunches or fruits may not develop properly.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPreviously, nematodes of the species Steinernema carpocapsae or some species of arthropods have been used against the weevils with some success. Another strategy is to infect the beetles with pathogens, for example with the fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Insecticides containing organophosphorus compounds can be injected into the stem to kill the larvae. After harvest, remove the affected stems and treat them with insecticides (2 g/l) to kill the egg laying weevils remaining there.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe adult weevils are black-colored, about 30 mm long, with a pointed head and a shiny armor. They are predominantly nocturnal but may also be found in the daytime during cooler months or cloudy days. They are attracted by volatile substances released by the banana plants. Females cut slits in leaf sheaths and lay white creamy, elliptical eggs superficially inside. After 5-8 days, fleshy, legless and yellowish white larvae hatch and start to feed on the tender tissues of the leaf sheaths.

       "  'data': 'Golden Apple Snail\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThis is a pest of wetland rice exclusively. The first symptom of damage is a reduced plant stand where the snails have severed the plant stalks below the water level. The crop is highly vulnerable at the early seedling stage, so the snails mainly damage direct wet-seeded rice and transplanted rice up to 30 days old. After that, the stems have become too thick and the snails cannot eat the hardened tissues. The snails usually cut the tillers first and then the leaves and stems are consumed under water. Other plants, like taro (Colocasia esculentamay) can also be attacked. The life span of this pest can vary from 119 days to 5 years, with higher temperatures leading to shorter longevity.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nMass snail and egg collection campaigns are very effective if carried out during land preparation, planting or crop establishment. Snails can also be harvested and sold as animal feed. Natural predators should be favored, e.g. red ants that feed on the snail eggs and birds or ducks that eat young snails. Domestic ducks can be put into fields during final land preparation or after crop establishment when plants are big enough.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with both preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Following normal fertilizer application rate and schedule, apply fertilizer in 2 cm of water to maximize negative effects on apple snails. Apply pesticides products only to low spots and water pathways rather than to the whole field. These products should be used immediately after transplanting or during the seedling establishment phase in direct seeded rice, and only for rice younger than 30 days old. Always read the label and ensure safe application.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by two species of golden apple snails, Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculata. They are highly invasive and can cause serious damage to rice crops. They usually spread through water pathways (irrigation canals, natural water distribution) or during flooding events. During dry periods, these snails bury themselves in the mud, and can hibernate up to six months, reemerging as water returns. The color and size help to tell these snails from native ones in rice cultures. Golden apple snails have muddy brown shell and golden pinkish or orange-yellow flesh. They are bigger and lighter in color compared to native snails. Its eggs are bright pink in color and are laid in clusters of several hundreds.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant healthy and vigorous seedlings.\\nKeep fields drained as much as possible during the vulnerable stages of the rice plant (below 30 days).\\nAlternatively, keep water level below 2 cm during this stage.\\nTransplant hardened, 25−30 day old seedlings from low density nursery beds.\\nHandpick snails and crush egg masses, ideally in the morning hours.\\nPlace papaya and cassava leaves around the rice paddies to attract snails for easier picking.\\nPlace a barrier where water enters and exits the rice field.\\nPlace bamboo stakes to provide sites for egg laying.\\nControl insecticide use in order not to affect natural predators.'},\n",

These spots often show a concentric growth that derives in concentric rings pattern, defined more clearly on the upper surface of leaves. As they grow, their center gradually becomes dry and turns grayish, occasionally cracking and falling out (shot-hole effect). These spots may also come together and produce irregular dead areas in the middle of the leaf blade. Under humid conditions, the fungi produce and release large amounts of spores, which may result in the sooty black appearance of the lesions. On stems, the development of lesions begins as small sunken spots which may later develop into cankers, splitting and cracking the tissue. Flowers buds may be shed in the case of severe infections, which eventually may lead to the failure of boll development.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens (10g/kg seeds) can provide some protection to crops. Spraying a solution of Pseudomonas fluorescens 0.2% every 10 days can reduce an infection significantly.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Usually, the disease is not lowering the yield to the extent that justifies a specific fungicidal treatment. In severe cases, fungicides like maneb which contains mancozeb (2.5 g/l), hexaconazole (1 ml/l), tebuconazole and difenoconazole can be used to control Alternaria leaf spot. Seed treatment with strobilurins (e.g. trifloxystrobin) or sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (e.g. triadimenol, ipconazole) can be used to make seeds resistant to the pathogen.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Alternaria macrospora, which survives on cotton residues if no living tissue or alternative host is available. The pathogen spreads through air-borne spores and water splashing onto healthy plants. The production of spores within the leaf spots as well as the infection process is favored by wet weather and temperatures of about 27 °C. Plants are most susceptible at the seedling stage and late in the season during the senescence of leaves. The infection risk decreases from the lower to upper cotton leaves. Under favorable conditions for the fungi, susceptible varieties of cotton can lose a large number of leaves rapidly (defoliation), especially where the boll stalk becomes infected.

Contrary to other nutrients, the symptoms of this deficiency are generally not very striking and can be difficult to identify. In mild cases, a possible indication for this disorder is that plants are dwarfed or stunted. However, no obvious symptoms are observed on leaves. In severe deficiencies, stem and petioles show a dark green to purple discoloration. The lower sides of older leaves also show a purple pigmentation, starting on the tips and margins and later expanding to the rest of the leaf surface. These leaves may become leathery and veins may form a brown netting. In some cases, phosphorus deficiency is characterized by burnt tips and the development of chlorosis as well as necrotic patches on the leaf margins. Flowers and fruits are produced, but fruit yields are low.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPhosphorus levels in soils can be replenished by applying farmyard manure, or other materials (organic mulch, compost and guano) or a combination thereof. The incorporation of residues to the soil after harvest can also contribute to maintaining a positive phosphorus balance in the long term and improve soil structure. The decomposition of organic matter provides a steady supply of plant-available phosphorus.\\nChemical Control\\nUse fertilizers containing phosphorus (P).\\nExamples: Diammonium phosphate (DAP), Single super phosphate (SSP).\\nConsult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.\\nFurther recommendations:\\nIt is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThere are differences in susceptibility to phosphorus deficiency between different crops. Roots absorb phosphate ions when they are dissolved in the soil water. Calcareous soils with high calcium concentrations can be poor in phosphorus. Most commonly, however, it is the availability of this nutrient that is limited because phosphorus is adhered to soil particles and cannot be taken up by the plant. Both alkaline soils and acidic soils can show low availability. Soils with low organic matter or iron-rich soils can also be problematic. Cold weather that hinders proper development and function of the roots can also lead to this disorder. Drought conditions or diseases that limit the absorption of water and nutrients by the roots can trigger deficiency symptoms. Soil moisture, in turn, increases the uptake of this nutrient and results in significantly higher yields.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse varieties that are efficient at mining phosphorus from the soil.\\nEnsure balanced and efficient fertilization of the crop.\\nIncorporate plant residues into the soil after harvest.\\nUse an integrated approach with mineral and organic fertilizers to keep soil nutrient balance.\\nLime soils if necessary to reach the appropriate soil pH.'},\n",

Initial symptoms appear as irregular, yellow stripes that gradually form a mosaic pattern. As the symptoms progress, these leaves become wrinkled, softened, curled downward and can finally wilt. When the infection is heavy, it can lead to a complete yellowing of the leaves and plants have a stunted appearance. Bulbs may not develop and, if they do so, they are reduced in size and may shoot prematurely, for example during storage. Onion plants used for seed production can show deformation of flower stems, reduction of flowers and seeds as well as a loss in seed quality. Germination rates are significantly affected.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo biological treatment seems to be available at the moment to treat this disease. Treatments against aphids include solutions with neem oil at 2% and neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) at 5%.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments. In the case of viruses a chemical treatment is not possible. Treatments against aphids include emamectin benzoate, indoxacarb or NSKE.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by a virus called Onion Yellow Dwarf Virus (OYDV). It can survive in plant debris in the field for a long period. Most commonly the virus is transmitted by infected plant parts such as bulbs, sets and volunteer plants in the field. It has a limited host range that is confined to plant species of the allium family (onions, garlic, shallots and few ornamental alliums). The disease can also be transmitted in a non-persistent manner via several aphid species (for example Myzus persicae). They carry the virus in hteir mouthparts and inject it into healthy plant while sucking their sap. Very often, the virus occurs in combination with other viruses in the same plant. The infection can result in reduced yield to a greater or lesser extent depending on that. For example, yield losses are higher when plants are also infected with leek yellow stripe virus.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nBe careful to use healthy planting material or seeds from a certified source.\\nUse tolerant or resistant varieties available in the area.\\nIf not sure whether the planting material is healthy or not, use true seeds instead of bulbs or sets.\\nCheck your plants or fields regularly for any sign of the disease.\\nControl aphid populations to avoid the spread of the disease.\\nRemove weeds that serve as alternative hosts.\\nRemove infected plants and plant parts and destroy them by burning for example.\\nPlan a crop rotation with non-hosts.'},\n",

Orange, velvety egg-shaped mass of about 1 cm in diameter are visible on individual grains of the panicle. Later on the grains turn yellowish-green or greenish-black. Only a few grains form spore balls in a panicle. Other parts of the plant are not affected. Grain weight and seed germination are reduced.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe treatment of seeds at 52° C for 10 min is an effective way to reduce the incidence of the disease. A preventive spray with copper-based fungicides during panicle emergence (2.5 g per liter of water) also. Once detected, spray the crop with copper-based fungicides to control the disease and increase yields slightly.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatment if available. Seed treatment with fungicides usually do not hold the disease in check. As a preventive measure spraying during panicle emergence (50 to 100%) with the following products can be effective: azoxystrobin, propiconazole, chlorothalonil, azoxystrobin + propiconazole, trifloxystrobin + propiconazole, trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole. Other products may help to effectively inhibit the progression of the disease once detected: aureofungin, captan or mancozeb.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Villosiclava virens, a pathogen that can infect plants at all stages, but symptoms are only visible shortly after flowering or during the grain-filling stage. Weather conditions determine the outcome of the infection, as high relative humidity (>90%), frequent rain and temperatures ranging from 25−35°C are favorable for the fungus. Soils with high nitrogen content also favor the disease. Early-planted rice plants usually have less problems with false smut. In worst case scenarios, the disease can be severe and losses can reach 25% of the crop. In India, a yield loss of up to 75% was observed.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse healthy seeds from certified retailers.\\nUse available resistant varieties.\\nIf possible plant early to avoid the worst of the disease.\\nAlternate wetting and drying of the fields rather than permanent flooding (reduction of humidity).\\nUse nitrogen moderately, and divide it in split applications.\\nMonitor fields for signs of the disease.\\nKeep field bunds and irrigation channels clean.\\nKeep the field clean of weeds and remove infected plant debris, panicles and seeds after harvest.\\nDeep plow and solarization of the field after harvest also help to reduce the carry-over.\\nWhere possible, perform conservation tillage and continuous rice cropping.\\nPlan a 2- or 3-year crop rotation with non-susceptible crops.'},\n",

Young larvae bore holes on growing shoots and move down, feeding on internal tissues. The infested twigs have wilted leaves, a sign of dieback of the shoot. The higher the number of leaves affected by the wilting, the further down the larvae have penetrated. Eventually, twigs turn dark colored or have dry leaves and gummy ooze. Later generations enter the fruits through the stem and bore irregular channels through the flesh, usually close to the pit. Exit holes are visible on fruits, surrounded by gummy exudation and larval frass. Opportunistic pathogens may colonize these wounds. Fruits become deformed and drop if severely affected. Usually, larvae feed only on one fruit and do not move from fruit back to twigs.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeveral parasitoid wasps of the genus Trichogramma and the braconid wasp Macrocentrus ancylivorus, have been used against the oriental fruit moth.

While feeding, it also produces copious amounts of honeydew that coats the leaves and encourages the growth of black sooty mold. During severe infestation, defoliation and twig dieback, as well as the reduced photosynthetic rates, lead to lower tree vigor and a significant reduction in fruit quality and yield.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nMost notable predators include ladybirds and lacewings. Specific natural enemies include the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, which young larvae feed on eggs of the scale and older ones on all scale stages. The parasitic fly, Cryptochaetum iceryae, is also a very effective parasite of this scale.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Scales and crawlers are covered by a thick wax coating, which makes them difficult to treat with chemical insecticides. Timely applications of products based on the active ingredient acetamiprid is recommended against this pest. The application of petroleum spray oils soon after hatching of the eggs can ward off the crawlers and deter them from feeding on plant tissues.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms on trees are caused by the sucking of the phloem sap by the cottony cushion scales Icerya purchasi. In some geographical areas other species may be predominant, for example Planococcus citri. The scale is about 10–15 mm in length and it can complete its life cycle in around 2 months when conditions are favorable. Females can produce up to 1000 eggs, which are carried on a cottony egg sac in the abdomen and laid on leaves. Newly hatched nymphs (or crawlers) feed first on leaves, usually along the veins, and young twigs. As they grow older, they can also be found on branches and the trunk, rarely on the fruit. They like moist, cool conditions and do well in citrus trees with dense canopies. As they develop, they build a thick, cottony waxy coat that protects them.

If not sure whether the plant material is from a healthy source, a hot water treatment may help to reduce the infestation risk.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments. If insecticides are needed, applications should be located on the soil to kill the pupae, as well as on plants and fruits in order to kill the adults. This approach might be the only possibility to avoid re-infestation.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused mainly by the thrips Chaetanaphothrips signipennis, but other species may also be involved (Helionothrips kadaliphilus). The pest is most commonly transmitted via infested plant material, or to a lesser degree directly by the insects flying between trees. Adults are slim, yellow to brown, about 1.3 mm in size and have narrow fringed wings with two dark areas on the forewings. The female lays tiny eggs (not visible to the naked eye) on the under leaf sheaths and where fruits touch the plant. After about 7 days, the wingless, white to cream larvae hatch. They grow to the size of adults within about 7 days. Then they move to the ground, enter the soil on the plant base and pupate. After an additional 7-10 days, the new generation of adult thrips hatches. There can be many generations per year. During hot and humid weather there can be population peaks.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse healthy planting material from certified sources.\\nRemove volunteer plants and avoid cultivating host plants around the main crop field.\\nCheck your plants or fields periodically for any sign of the pest.\\nUse bunch covers in early growth stages already to protect the plants.\\nRemove infested plants and destroy them by burning.\\nRemove abandoned plantation areas as these can serve as sources for pest spreading.'},\n",

Preventive measures are recommended to avoid the introduction of the bacterium in new orchards.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterium that colonizes the vascular tissue of roots, stems and leaves in peach trees, causing the striking symptoms commonly know as phony peach disease. Alternative hosts include plum and almond trees as well as grapes and citrus (triggering different symptoms there). These bacteria literally block the transport of water and nutrients in the plant through the xylem, thus causing symptoms that resemble water and nutrient deficiencies. It is transmitted persistently by a series of insects, among others the sharpshooter leafhopper (Homalodisca species) and some spittle bugs (Cercopidae). Managing the insect vectors and removing alternative hosts that may act as reservoir around the orchard (including wild tree varieties) will help to reduce the source of inoculum. Temperature and rainfall are crucial factor for the growth of the bacterium since it can only persist from one season to the next in areas with mild winters. It is not seed-borne.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose sites whose surroundings have no history of phony peach disease.\\nMonitor the orchard during early summer for sign of the disease.\\nControl weeds in and about the orchard, since they may serve as reservoirs for both the bacterium and the vectors.\\nControl alternative tree hosts around the orchard.\\nRogue entire trees at the first sign of the disease.\\nCheck for quarantine measures in the country and contact competent authorities.\"},\n",

In contrast, highly-acidic soils increase the availability of this nutrient. Excessive or unbalanced use of fertilizers may also result in some micronutrients competing with each other to become available to the plant. Mn has an important role in photosynthesis and nitrate assimilation. Like iron, boron and calcium, manganese is immobile within the plant, accumulating mostly in the lower leaves.

Spinosad should not be applied to flowering plants.\\nChemical Control\\nTussock moth infestations are typically controlled by natural enemies, so using insecticides is not usually necessary unless the plants are young and show problems in growth. If there is heavy defoliation, chemical control may be the only solution. It is important to find which kinds of pesticides are allowed for this use in your region. Some active ingredients that have been mentioned in literature for controlling tussock moths include Chlorantraniliprole, Methoxyfenozide, and Phosmet. Note that sprays used to control other spring caterpillar problems may also control tussock moths.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nTussock moths, mainly in the Orgyia, Dasychira, and Euproctis genera, cause damage to plants worldwide. They adult moths have hair all over their body and can be brown, grey, or white. The Tussock moth goes through several stages in its life cycle. The moths lay their eggs in masses in the fall, and the eggs overwinter until the following spring. When the weather warms up, the eggs hatch and the young caterpillars emerge. The caterpillars begin to feed on the leaves of crops, trees and shrubs, growing and moulting as they eat. As they grow, they develop the characteristic tufts of hair that give the tussock moth its name. After a few weeks of feeding, the caterpillars will form a cocoon. In the cocoon, the caterpillar transforms into an adult moth. The adult moth will emerge from the cocoon and mate, and the female will lay eggs to start the cycle anew. Moth populations tend to increase in localised areas due to the females being unable to fly.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nIt is important to be careful when dealing with tussock moths because their caterpillars have hairs that can irritate human skin and easily detach when touched.\\nWear protective clothing and avoid inhaling any caterpillar parts.\\nLook for egg masses and young caterpillars and remove them.\\nMonitoring for the pest is always the best approach.'},\n",

As the disease progresses, the lesions enlarge and turn white to light brown or gray in the center with a purple, dark brown or blackish margin. The lesions are circular or irregular in shape and vary in size depending on the time of infection. A concentric zonation of the spots occurs, alternating dark and light brown or red margins. Affected leaves eventually become pale in color and finally fall off.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo this day, no biological control methods are know. If you have successfully tried a way to decrease the incidence or gravity of the disease, please let us know.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available.

Fungicides containing carbendazem 3gm/litre, captan 2 gm/litre at the same rate show also produce good results.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by a fungus of the Cercospora family that attacks cotton plants, Mycosphaerella gossypina. It is different from those that affect other crops such as soybean or pepper. In the field it is often difficult to differentiate Cercospora leaf spot from other foliar diseases, such as target spot. However, the specificity of this disease lies in the fact that it is often found in cotton plants undergoing episodes of stress such as drought or nutrient deficiency (mainly potassium). Maintaining plant vigor by having a proper fertilization scheme and preventing drought stress through proper irrigation helps to delay primary infections significantly. It will also reduce the severity of the outbreaks. The disease is favored by temperatures between 20-30 °C and high relative humidity.

Symptoms include sunken lesions and brown or black discoloration on roots, shrinking root system and root decay. If they develop at all, nodules are less numerous, smaller and pale in color. In plants growing from infected seeds, seedlings can blight shortly after emergence. The plants that survive are chlorotic and have poor vigor. Plants infected during late stages of development show stunted growth. Opportunistic pathogens colonize and feed on decaying tissue, which makes the symptoms worse. In the field, the disease often occurs in patches and may expand if conditions are favorable for the pathogens.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nApplication of solutions containing minute amounts of kinetin or associated with the fungus Trichoderma harzianum as seed soaking could be used for controlling soil-borne diseases such as root rot of lentil. In addition they can also improve growth and productivity of the surviving plants. Field trials are now being carried out to test these products in large cultures.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatment if available.

Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium solani are part of this complex, as the rest of the group, it can survive in soils for long periods of time. When conditions are favorable, it colonizes the root tissues and impair the transport of water and nutrients to the aerial parts of the plant, explaining the wilting and chlorosis of plants.

       "  'data': 'Bitter Rot of Grape\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe most obvious symptoms are seen on berries. The initial symptom exists as a brownish, water soaked lesion, seen on maturing fruit. The fruits become susceptible to infection at the onset of ripening. Once the fruits are infected, they soften and small fungal fruiting structures form in concentric rings on the surface. The lesion spreads quickly in concentric rings and the entire fruit is usually affected within a short period of time. When light colored fruits are infected, they turn brown. After 2 to 3 days, the skin of the berry ruptured by black pustules. Under moist conditions, the pustules coalesce to form irregular blisters over the surface of the fruit. The skin of the fruit can become torn, and the fruit can shrivel in to black mummies closely resembling those of black rot, Phyllosticta ampelicida. Symptoms also develop on young shoots and stems of fruit clusters, but are less obvious. On infected leaves, the symptoms appear as tiny, sunken, reddish-brown flecks with yellow halos. The spores can also infect shoots, petioles and pedicels. When pedicels are infected the fungus may become inactive until the fruit matures.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nOrganic or reduced risk compounds such as oils, phosphorus acid, potassium bi-carbonate, potassium monophosphate, oxidate, compost tea, among others can be used to help reduce the incidence of bitter rot.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Protect fruit during warm season with fungicides from bloom to harvest, especially susceptible cultivars. The disease can be controlled in the early to mid- summer by fungicide sprays targeted against other diseases such as downy mildew and black rot. For effective control in the field and storage, apply sprays of iprodion 75 WG (0.2%), bitertanol 25 WP (0.1%) and thiophanate methyl (0.1%) .\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the fungus Greeneria uvicola, which overwinters in the vineyard, on almost any plant debris especially berry mummies. The fungus tissue growing on plant litter produce spores. Weather conditions such as warm, humid and rainy conditions favor fungus growth and spore formation. Symptoms are noticed on berries one week after spores come in contact with a healthy berry, and in less time if the berry is wounded. They are usually active in low temperatures. Spores present on fruit can be rain splashed to other fruits and can cause subsequent infections.

The larvae of these insects are xylophagous, meaning that they feed from the sapwood below the bark. Adults are of a dull black or dark-green color, with two orange antennae and rows of yellow leathery hairs on the back. Females usually choose weakened trees, pierce a hole through the bark and bore a tunnel into the sapwood. The eggs are laid along this mother gallery. After hatching, the larvae bore shorter and narrower galleries underneath the bark, starting from the mother tunnel and nearly perpendicular to it. The damage to the vascular tissues of the tree blocks the transport of nutrient and water, leading to the withering of branches and fruit drop.

These patches are distributed all over the stem and they correspond to fungal masses that gradually grow on the epidermis. Occasionally they also appear on leaves. Plant tissues become necrotic as the fungus grows and feed on them. These necrotic areas often cover the buds on the stem and these tend to die, reducing the sprouting ability of stem cuttings.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere are no biological control solutions known for this fungus.

General fungicidal sprays are rarely recommended and therefore, the accent should be put on preventive measures and good field practices.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nCassava bud necrosis is caused by a fungus which occurs on the surface of stems and leaves. The main source of inoculum of the disease is infected cassava plants. Stems and leaves that remain as residues on the ground after harvest can also serve spread the disease. The fungal spores produced on these debris can later be carried by the wind from plant to plant or to other farms. However, the main vector of distribution is the usage of infected stem cuttings for planting. These stem cuttings with infected buds fail to sprout and can be detected in the field easily. Alternative hosts for the fungus are grasses, cereals, banana and mango. The disease is usually found in cassava growing in humid environments. Fields with poor farm sanitation in high relative humidity are particularly prone to develop the disease.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use disease free stem cuttings for planting (certified sources).\\nPlant resistant varieties if available.\\nWeed management and sufficient space between plants is crucial to ensure ventilation, which decreases the amount of fungus in the field.\\nMonitor and immediately remove and destroy diseased cuttings (by burning or burying), and replace them with healthy ones.\\nPlant debris should be removed and destroyed at a decent distance from the field.\\nCrop rotation with non-host plants avoids the survival of the fungus in the field.\\nMake sure to disinfect your tools after field work.\\nDo not transport transport cuttings from infected fields to other farms.\\nFarming tools should be disinfected with a common bleach solution after use to prevent the disease.'},\n",

The generation feeding on flowers makes a nest by spinning together several florets with silk threads. The feeding activity id denoted by abundant grains of frass. In the fruit-feeding generation, the larvae bore into small fruits of the olive tree in early summer and exit the host in early autumn, when they are fully grown, to pupate in the soil. Premature fruit drop is a direct consequence of the damage caused to the fruits.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPredators are numerous and include some species of ants, chrysopids, and beetles that feed on eggs of one or several of the generations. Parasitoids include several species of wasps, among others Trichogramma evanescens and Ageniaspis fuscicollis.

Pheromone traps are very effective in catching adult moths and should be installed in early spring.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Mating disruptors or ethylene applications can effectively control the pest. Organophosphates compounds applied against the larval stage feeding on flowers (first generation) may provide good control.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage to buds, leaves and fruits are caused by three different generations of larvae of the species Prays oleae. Adult moths have grayish forewings with silver metallic tones and several black spots, which in some specimens may be missing. The hindwings are of a uniform gray. Larvae vary in color and size depending on the generation in question. Each of these has specialized in a specific part of the olive tree. Larvae of the first batch (leaf generation) appear in mid spring and feed within the buds and at a later stage, on the flowers. The second batch of larvae (flower generation) emerges in early summer and is the most destructive.

Larvae hatch after 3 to 5 days and usually bore directly into the fruit. The fully grown larva is sturdy and pink colored with a brown head. When feeding is complete, pupation occurs in a gray, tough cocoon weaved on stems, dried shoots, or among fallen leaves. The pupal stage lasts for 6 to 8 days, after which adults appear. The adult moths live for two to five days, completing a life cycle that lasts 21-43 days depending on the environmental conditions.

       "  'data': 'Anthracnose of Blackgram\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe infection can occur at any growth stage and is visible on leaves, stems, petioles and pods. If the infection occurs after seed germination or if the seeds are infected, seedlings will show minute rust specks that slowly enlarge to form eye-spots and finally get blighted. On older plants, initial symptoms appear as small and irregular dark brown to black water-soaked spots, more commonly on the lower surface of leaves or petioles. Over time, the spots grow into sunken lesions with darker centers and yellow, orange or bright red margins, and also appear on the upper surface of leaves. Pods have rust-colored lesions and might shrivel and dry up. In case of heavy infection, affected parts might wilt and wither off. The development of cankers on stems and petioles is usually followed by defoliation.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBiological agents might help to control the infection. The fungus Trichoderma harzianum and the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens used as a seed treatment compete with Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. Fungicide sprays include products based on copper oxychloride 3g/l at 15 days interval.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chemical treatment of the disease may not be economically viable if weather conditions are not favorable. Seeds can be soaked and treated with appropriate fungicides, for example thiram 80% WP @ 2 g/l or captan 75WP @ 2.5 g/l of water. Fungicide sprays include products based on folpet, mancozeb, thiophanate methyl (0.1%) or copper oxychloride 3g/l at 15 days interval.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum survives in the soil and on infected seeds and plant debris. It also overwinters in alternative hosts. The spores are transferred to the growing seedlings via rain, dew or field work when foliage is wet. It is thus important to restrict the activity in the field (workers, treatments...etc) when the foliage is wet from rain or dew. Cool to moderate temperatures (13-21°C) and periods of frequent rainfall are also favorable to the fungus and its transmission, resulting in increased occurrence and severity of the infection.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse certified pathogen-free seed material.\\nPlant resilient tolerant or resistant varieties.\\nCheck your plants or fields for any sign of disease.\\nAvoid excessive weed growth (weed can serve as alternate host) near your cultures.\\nProvide good field sanitation.\\nAvoid working in the fields when foliage is wet, and clean your tools and equipment.\\nCrop rotation with non-host crops is recommended every three years.\\nBury infected plant debris after harvest or remove and burn it.'},\n",

       "  'data': \"Sunburn in Pistachio\\n\\nSymptoms\\nAbiotic sunburn refers to the damage caused to the trees by a combination of direct sunlight and excessive temperatures. These factors alter the moisture in the plant tissues, leading initially to the wilting of young, tender leaves. These leaves gradually turn pale green and after 2–3 days they eventually start to develop lesions near the apex and the margins. The parched lesions later progress towards the middle of the leaf lamina. The defoliation caused by drought stress or insect attack can also lead to sunscalds to the bark. There, they take the form of cracks and cankers, which eventually develop into dead areas on the trunk.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nWhite clay or talc formulations can be sprayed on foliage and trunk to physically block the sunlight. This may reduce temperatures by 5-10 °C. Products based on calcium carbonate or crystalline limestone are also recommended. Carnauba wax products serve as a natural sunscreen to plants.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Abscisic acid applied as a fertilizer supplement helps to reduce sunburn damage to fruits such as apples and may therefore also work in other crops. Anti-transpirant products that reduce water loss by the leaves, such as those based on poly-1-P menthene, have also shown good results in some studies.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSunburn injury is common in trees grown in areas with high solar radiation, high air temperatures, and low relative humidity. Altitude also plays a role since the ultraviolet (UV) radiation is greater at higher elevations. Symptoms are visible on leaves, fruits and bark. The incidence and severity of sunburn depends also on factors such as the variety of plant, its growth stage and soil moisture. Sunburn is particularly severe when air temperature and the number of sunny hours are high during the development of the fruit. The alternation of weather events is also important: thus, damage can also occur when cool or mild weather is abruptly followed by hot, sunny weather.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse varieties that are more tolerant to sunburn.\\nUse cover crops between the rows to enhance soil water retention capacity (maize or pigeon pea in pineapple orchard for example).\\nMake sure that the irrigation is well-matched with the crop's water requirements.\\nIrrigate just before or during heat waves to avoid tree stress and sunburn.\\nAvoid excessive summer pruning and leaf stripping.\\nImprove air movement through the canopy.\\nPlant or tree sprinkler cooling systems can also be implemented.\\nShade netting can also be used if needed.\"},\n",

       "  'data': 'Urd Bean Leaf Crinkle Virus\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe third trifoliate leafs of seedlings that developed from infected seeds are much larger than usual. These leaves are of lighter green color than usual. Petioles might be shorter and leaf veins thicker, with a characteristic reddish discoloration. One month after planting, leaves start to shrink and crinkle, and become rough and leathery. Plants infected through insect vectors during later growth stages usually develop symptoms in younger leaves, the older ones remaining symptom-free. Leaves show conspicuous venial chlorosis, and the flowers are deformed. Smaller flower buds and stunted growth can be observed. In the few productive flowers, discolored and oversized seeds are visible. Pollen fertility and pod formation is severely compromised, resulting in heavy yield losses.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDifferent biological means can help to control the infection. Soil or foliar spray application of Pseudomonas fluorescens strains can help to control vector populations. It has been found that fresh butter milk and casein have an effect on the transmission of the disease. Several plant extracts of Mirabilis jalapa, catharanthns roseus, Datura metal, Bougainvillea spectabilis, Boerhaavia diffusa and Azadirachta indica had an effect on the incidence of the virus in the field.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. No chemical treatment against the virus is available but systemic insecticides can be employed to control vector populations. Seed dressing with imidacloprid 70 WS @ 5 ml/kg is usually recommended. Insecticides based on dimethoate an also be used as foliar spray applications. The compound 2,4-dixohexahydro 1,3,5-triazine (DHT) hinders the transmission of the virus and increases its incubation period.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe virus is often seed-borne, leading to the appearance of a primary infection in seedlings. Secondary infection from plant to plant happens through insect vectors that feed on plant sap such as some species of aphids (for example, Aphis craccivora and A. gossypii), a whitefly (Bemisia tabacci) and a leaf feeding beetle (Henosepilachna dodecastigma). The virus transmission extent and the severity of the disease are determined by the plants degree of tolerance, the presence of vectors in the fields and the prevailing climatic conditions. The virus can decrease grain yield from 35 to 81%, depending on the time of infection.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse seeds from healthy plants or certified pathogen-free seeds.\\nPlant tolerant or resistant varieties available in your area.\\nMonitor your plants or field for any sign of disease vectors.\\nRemove infected-looking plants and bury them.\\nAvoid excessive weed growth (weed can serve as alternate host) near your cultures.\\nUse barrier crops such as maize, sorghum and pearl millet to reduce the spread of the disease.\\nRemove and burn plant debris after harvest.\\nPractice crop rotation with crops that are not susceptible to vectors.'},\n",

As they enlarge, they coalesce and develop into brown blotches that are no longer limited by the veins. These patches of necrotic tissue are dotted with dark brown or black specks that are visible to the naked eye. Eventually, the leaves wither, curling in the process.

Fungicides work best if combined with field sanitation and other listed preventive measures.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nCherry leaf scorch is caused by the fungus Apiognomonia erythrostoma, which can affect, besides cherry, plum and apricot trees. The fungus overwinters in fallen leaves on the orchard floor or on those hanging on the trees. In spring, when favorable temperatures are reached, the fungus germinates and begins to produce spores that are later spread onto healthy leaves by wind or rain. Leaves remain susceptible throughout the growing season, which implies that the infection cycle can be repeated several times over the year. This is highly dependent on the environmental conditions and the developmental stage of the tree itself. Cherry leaves must be unfolded and the fruit must have attained a visible size to be infected. The disease usually affects weakened trees and can be a sign of a underlying stress in the orchard, such as drought or root damage.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nIf Apiognomonia erythrostoma is listed as a quarantine organism in the country, report to the competent authority.\\nUse more tolerant varieties, if available for the tree in question.\\nSelect a planting sight that is exposed to direct sunlight and has good air circulation.\\nA proper pruning to open the canopy will increase sunlight penetration and air circulation.\\nMonitor the fields and remove weeds that can harbor the pathogen.\\nAdd plant fortifiers to complete a balanced fertilization program.\\nConserve soil moisture by mulching trees with organic material.\\nCheck the plants for any sign of disease after the leaves are completely unfolded.\\nRemove, collect and destroy the fallen cherry leaves in late autumn.\\nAlternatively, bury them deep in the ground.'},\n",

Sorghum, corn, potatoes, and beans are the most severely affected crops whereas wheat and alfalfa are the least sensitive. Calcareous, alkaline soils (pH 7.5 or higher) derived from limestone make plants especially prone to iron deficiency. Iron is important for photosynthesis and for the development and maintenance of root nodules in legumes. Therefore, iron deficiency severely depresses nodule mass, nitrogen fixation, and crop yield.

They also feed on tender shoots, occasionally eating up rings of bark around them. This impairs water and nutrient transport and can thus lead to the decline of the branch. In some crops, the weevils can also dive into the flowers with their snout and destroy the reproductive structures. High populations can cause significant damage, especially to young trees. Adults emerging from an area that was previously under pasture may also attack newly planted vineyards or orchards. Grapes or fruits are not usually damaged. Larvae feed on the roots of the crops but the damage they cause seems to be marginal.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo this day there does not seem to be biological control agents available against this insect. Please notify us if you know of any.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Treatments with synthetic pyrethroids are the most effective in controlling the Curculio weevil. Foliar sprays of products containing alpha-cypermethrin can also be used in trees with no fruits or non-bearing grapevines.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the Curculio weevil (Otiorhynchus cribricollis). Adults feed at night. During the day, they shelter under the bark, in the crotch of branches, between fruit and leaves, or in burrows in the soil. Eggs are laid on the trees or in loose organic matter on the soil. After hatching, the young larvae dig into the soil and feed on plant rootlets. They pupate in autumn. The length of the pupal stage depends on weather conditions but it usually lasts three to four weeks. The life cycle of the Curculio weevil is optimal at moderate temperatures. It only has one generation each year, but their reactivation after the heat of summer may give the impression that there is a second generation. Most adult weevils don’t fly but some can fly short distances.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor for over-wintering adults in early spring if damaged stems are observed.\\nKeep weeds under thorough control, as they might serve as alternative hosts.\\nProtect trees with rings of sticky material so that adult weevils cannot climb up the trunk.'},\n",

The growth of the seedlings is compromised and they might die prematurely or present stunted growth. During secondary infections, leaf veins and petioles develop angular brick-red to black lesions, first on the underside of leaves, later also on the upper side. Circular, light brown to rust-colored lesions, surrounded by a black margin, appear on pods and stems. In severely infected pods, these lesions can shrivel and deform slightly, adopting a sunken canker aspect. Infected seeds are often discolored and develop brown to black cankers. Common bean plants are very susceptible to this disease.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nExtracts of neem oil applied every 7 to 10 days throughout the warmest period of the growing season limit the growth of the fungus. Biological agents can also help to control the infection. Biocontrol agents such as the fungus Trichoderma harzianum and the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens for example, limit the growth of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum if used as a seed treatment.

Apply fungicides containing mancozeb, chlorothalonil, flutriafol, penconazole, or copper-based products when the foliage is dry.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBlack spot disease is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. It is mainly seed-borne, but also survives on crop residues and in alternative hosts. When the environmental conditions are favorable, it releases its spores and is spread in the field by wind and rain. Cool to moderate temperatures (13-21°C), periods of high humidity, dew, wet foliage or frequent rainfall favor the life cycle of the fungus and the progression of the disease. Since the fungus is disseminated in the presence of water, it can also spread due to mechanical injuries during field work carried out while the foliage is wet.

Insecticides of the group of organophosphates (chloryphos, malathion) are also available but these are expensive and can be toxic to the handler and the environment.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage to the crop is caused by the insect Cosmopolites sordidus and its larvae. Adults are dark brown to gray black, with shining armor. They are most commonly found at the base of the plant, associated with crop residues, or in leaf sheaths. They are nocturnal and survive without feeding for several months. Females lay white, oval eggs in holes on crop residues in soil or hidden in the leaf sheaths. Egg development does not occur below 12°C. After hatching, young larvae bore tunnels in the roots or in stem tissues, weakening the plants and sometimes causing them to fall over.

It can actually be present in all varieties of citrus, without them developing any symptoms. Those are only expressed when an infected budwood is grafted and grown on a susceptible rootstock (trifoliate orange, citrange). The viroid is carried in the plant sap and can thus be spread from tree to tree by budding or grafting activities. Pruning with contaminated tools can also be a way of transmitting the disease. Natural grafting of tree roots can also transmit the viroid between trees. Contrarily to many other citrus viruses, exocortis is not transmitted by sap sucking insects, as there is no known insect vector of the disease. Seed transmission is unknown.

Initially, infected leaves show only yellowing of veins but the entire leaf turns yellow during later stages. When the plants get infected during 20 days after germination, they remain stunted. If the young leaves get infected during the early season, they become completely yellow, brown and then dry up. Plants that are infected after flowering are characterized by upper leaves and flowering parts showing vein clearing symptoms. They will still produce some fruits but these become yellow and hard. Plants that were growing healthy and fruiting normal until late season will then get few small shoots at the basal portion of the stem.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nRestrict the vector by spraying 5% neem seed kernel extract, or ginger, garlic, and chili extracts.

Hence, it is advisable to always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Early application of insecticides to the soil against certain white fly groups and diseases seem to be the most effective method. White flies quickly develop resistance to all pesticides, so a rotation of different formulation is recommendable. Two sprays of Acetamiprid 20SP (40g a.i/ha) has been proven effective in reducing the incidence of the mosaic virus and subsequently increases the yield of Okra.

       "  'data': 'Fire Blight\\n\\nSymptoms\\nFireblight is characterized by a series of symptoms on leaves, blossoms, fruits and shoots. Leaves and blossoms start to wither and turn quickly green gray and later brown or black. They remain attached to the branches throughout the season. Growing shoots also turn green gray, wilt and bend over taking a ‘shepherd’s crook’ aspect. As the disease progresses, more and more shoots shrivel and die. In severe infections, trees may appear to have been scorched by fire, giving the disease its name. Cankers appear on branches and gives them a darker color, with sunken and cracked bark. Underneath the dead bark, the wood is stained with a reddish brown color. In warm, humid weather, a slimy white liquid may exude from the infected plant parts. If left untreated, the infection moves down to the roots and the entire trees can die.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDilutions of Bordeaux mixture or other copper product (about 0.5%) applied several times during blossoming period may reduce new infections. Timely application following weather conditions is recommended. Apply at four- to five-day intervals during periods of high humidity. Be aware that some copper products may cause scarring of the fruit surface. Applications of products containing Streptomyces lydicus can also help to reduce bacterial spread.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Copper products can be used during blossom period when trying to control fire blight. However, even multiple applications does not confer adequate control. When pruning, tools should be disinfected with a 10% bleach solution or an anti-bacterial cleaner.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nFireblight is a disease caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora that infects apples, pears and ornamental plants of the same family. Stone fruits, such as plums, cherries, peaches and nectarines are not affected by this disease. Damage can be seen from spring to autumn. The bacteria overwinters in cankers on twigs, branches or trunks. Under favorable conditions during the spring, it resumes growth into the inner tissues, conferring them a brown color. This hinders water and nutrient transport and leads to the wilting of the shoot tips, that eventually bend over downward. Splashing rain or insects transmit the bacteria to nearby open flowers or quickly growing shoots. High soil fertility and soil moisture also increase the severity of damage. Warmer conditions or injuries favors the infection.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resistant varieties, if available.\\nChoose slow-growing varieties that are not so responsive to fertilizers.\\nMonitor orchards regularly for signs of the disease.\\nPrune out infected branches and burn them, preferably by the end of the winter.\\nClean cutting tools carefully with a disinfectant after use.\\nMake sure not to injure the trees during field work.\\nAllow for an open canopy through proper pruning.\\nDo not apply excess nitrogen to the trees.\\nMake sure not to plant alternative hosts around the fields.\\nIn cases of serious infection, remove the entire tree, including the stump.\\nDo not irrigate trees during blooming period.'},\n",

The angular appearance is due to the restriction of the lesions by fine veins on the cotton leaf. In some cases, the spots on the leaf blade may spread along the major leaf veins. As disease progresses, these lesions gradually turn into brown, necrotic areas. The infection of stems results in black cankers that grow around the vascular tissues and girdle them, causing the portions above the canker to die and premature defoliation of the plant. A white waxy crust containing the bacterium may form on old leaf spots or cankers. Bolls may become infected causing boll rot, rotted seeds and discolored lint. Infected bolls have round, rather than angular, lesions that initially may appear water-soaked. As the infection proceeds, bolls lesions will be sunken and dark brown or black.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nApply talc-based powder formulations containing the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis against the bacteria X. malvacearum.

Seed treatment with authorized antibiotics and seed dressing with copper oxychloride are very effective against the bacteria causing cotton bacterial blight.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nCotton bacterial blight is caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum, a bacterium that survives in infested crop debris or seeds. It is one of the most devastating diseases of cotton. Significant rainfall events and high humidity, combined with warm temperatures, favor the development of the disease. The bacteria enter leaf tissues through the natural openings in the leaves (stomata) or mechanical wounds. This explains why the disease is most severe following storms that produce heavy rains or hail. Since the infections may be seed-borne, the delinting of seeds through an acid treatment has been instrumental in minimizing the spread of bacterial blight through contaminated seed. Seedlings growing from volunteer plants may also be a source of primary infection by bacterial blight.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant high-quality, disease-free seeds or seeds delinted through an acid treatment.\\nUsing blight-resistant varieties is the more efficient method to avoid the disease.\\nScout fields, identify infected plants and remove them as well as some neighboring plants.\\nKeep the canopy as open as possible to reduce humidity and promote drying of the foliage.\\nDo not cultivate or move equipment through fields when foliage is wet.\\nDo not irrigate with overhead irrigation systems.\\nHarvest infested fields as soon as possible to avoid more losses.\\nRemove plants as soon as possible from fields and burn them.\\nIncorporate infected residue deep into the soil to favor decomposition.\\nPlan a crop rotation with non-susceptible plants.'},\n",

These factors alter the moisture in the plant tissues, leading initially to the wilting of young, tender leaves. These leaves gradually turn pale green and start to develop lesions near the apex and the margins after 2–3 days. The parched lesions later progress towards the middle of the leaf lamina. The defoliation caused by drought stress or insect attack can also lead to sunscalds to fruit or bark, since these are not shaded by the leaves anymore. In the bark they can take the form of cracks and cankers, which eventually develop into dead areas on the trunk.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nWhite clay or talc formulations can be sprayed on foliage and trunk to physically block the sunlight. This may reduce temperatures by 5-10 °C. Products based on calcium carbonate or crystalline limestone are also recommended. Carnauba wax products serve as a natural sunscreen to plants.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Abscisic acid applied as a fertilizer supplement helps to reduce sunburn damage to fruits such as apples and may therefore also work in other crops. Anti-transpirant products that reduce water loss by the leaves, such as those based on poly-1-P menthene, have also shown good results in some studies.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSunburn injury is common in plants or trees grown in areas with high solar radiation, high air temperatures, and low relative humidity. Altitude also plays a role since the ultraviolet (UV) radiation is greater at higher elevations. Symptoms are visible on leaves, fruits and bark. The incidence and severity of sunburn also depends on factors such as the variety of plant, its growth stage and soil moisture. Sunburn is particularly severe when air temperature and the number of sunny hours are high during the ripening period. The alternation of weather events is also important: thus, damage can also occur when cool or mild weather is abruptly followed by hot, sunny weather.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse varieties that are more tolerant to sunburn.\\nMake sure that the irrigation is well-matched with the crop's water requirements.\\nIrrigate just before heat waves to avoid plant stress and sunburn.\\nAvoid excessive summer pruning and leaf stripping.\\nImprove air movement through the canopy.\\nImplement a plant or tree sprinkler cooling system.\\nShade netting or fruit bagging can also be applied if needed.\\nUse cover crops between the rows to enhance soil water retention capacity (maize or pigeon pea in pineapple orchard for example).\"},\n",

Alternative hosts are English laurel and nectarines. The fungus overwinters in lesions in buds and twigs or in mummified fruits. When the weather conditions are favorable, they resume growth and produce spores that are dispersed by rain splashes to healthy tissues.

Other signs of an infestation are dead vegetative buds in spring, discoloration of flower buds, blossom blasting and abscission, and reduced shoot growth. Young leave internodes may be malformed causing a ‘witch’s broom’ effect when observed from the distance.

If large populations are found, the olive trees should be treated before the buds bloom. Wettable sulfur has proven effective, but damage to the tree can occur at temperatures above 32 °C. For high temperatures, dusting sulfur is safer to use than wettable sulfur. Spraying sulfur is another option.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the olive bud mite, Oxycenus maxwelli. It is a minute organism (0.1-0.2 mm) that is not visible to the naked eye. It is yellowish to dark tan, slow moving, and has a wedge-shaped, flattened body that is typical of many species of this family. Since they feed exclusively on olive orchards, their life cycle is closely related to that of the olive tree. In the spring, they move to new leaves and buds to reproduce and females lay about 50 eggs there. Emerging larvae and nymphs feed in numbers on flowers and can severe the stalks, making them to fall prematurely.

Bacterial ooze is sometimes perceptible in infected tissues at early stages of the disease. With age, the lesions develop brown necrotic stripes in their centers, that later dry and fall out, giving the leaf a ragged appearance. In some susceptible corn varieties, chlorotic striping of the whorl leaves and distortion of the upper nodes of the plant can be observed.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo this day, no effective organic treatment is available. Alternative options for control of bacterial spot in corn are limited to the use of preventive measures and good field practices.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways plan an integrated pest or disease management, with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Currently, chemical treatment is limited to copper or copper combined products. Many sprays are only marginally effective, making the disease very difficult to control once an epidemic is underway.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms depend greatly on the strength of the pathogen, the corn variety and the environmental conditions. The bacteria survives in crops debris in soils, on numerous alternative hosts and weeds and on volunteer crop plants. It is disseminated between plants by irrigation water, wind, or contaminated workers and equipment. The bacteria enters the plant through natural openings or wounds. It can withstand temperatures between 0 and 35 °C, but it thrives in the range 25-30°C. The disease is worst during periods of wet humid weather.

Larvae feed on the inner contents of the plant and on the seeds within the pods. Initial symptoms appear as boreholes on the floral buds, flowers and green pods soon after the larvae hatch. Damage on the pods is characterized by round holes and frass deposits at the entry point, usually close to the pod end. Honey dew secretions and movement of black ants around the secretion points can also be observed. Black discoloration indicates pod decay. Since the larvae directly attack the pods, the infestation leads to heavy yield loss.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe infestation can be controlled effectively through the release of natural enemies in the field. Egg and larvae parasitoids such as Trichogramma chilotraeae, Trichogrammatoidea bactrae, Cotesia specularis, Hyperencyrtus lucoenephila and Litrodromus crassipes may have a good effect. Biopesticides containing Paecilomyces lilacinus and Vetricillium lecani can be used as foliar application to control the infestation. Spray NSKE 5% twice followed by Neem oil @ 2% for the control of larvae.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Chemical treatment may not be necessary if populations of natural enemies are preserved. If insecticides are needed, products containing lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin can be sprayed and may give a level of control between 80 and 90 % in cowpea and mung bean.

Sunken, white, angular or circular spots develop on the upper side of leaves, often surrounded by an irregular reddish line and a large yellow halo. On the lower side of the leaf lamina, these spots appear with a diffuse colored border instead. As the fungus develops and symptoms progress, the spots acquire a gray, velvety aspect, something particularly evident during humid weather. The disease is commonly found in the humid but cooler cassava-growing regions.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nAs of today, no biological control measures are available to control the spread of the fungus. To avoid the disease, it is essential to use disease-free planting material and adopt the appropriate preventive measures.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. White leaf spot in cassava can be controlled effectively with fungicidal sprays containing thiophanate (0.20%), chlorthalonil at monthly intervals. Copper fungicides, metalaxyl and mancozeb are also recommended. Herbicide could also be used to control the growth of weeds on the field.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Phaeoramularia manihotis, which survives the dry season in old, infected leaves on the plant or on those laying on the ground. Under favorable conditions, it produces spores below the necrotic patches on the lower surface of leaves. From there, these spores spread to new plants by wind or rain splashes. The penetration into healthy tissues occurs through natural pores on leaves and as the fungus slowly colonize the plant, symptoms start to appear. Long distance spread can also occur when diseased planting material is transported to other fields or farms. Some weeds also serve as alternative hosts. It is usually not harmful to cassava plans and does not affect yields significantly if infestation is not severe. However, cool and humid, rainy weather favors the life cycle of the fungus and can increase the severity of the disease.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use disease-free cuttings.\\nPlant resistant varieties, if available in the area.\\nMake sure to have a wide spacing between plants, allowing for a good ventilation of the canopy.\\nPlant early in the wet season, so that crops have gained strength before reaching the susceptible stage (6-8-months-old during the dry season).\\nDo not plant new cassava crops next to old ones, with higher odds to be diseased.\\nRake and burn fallen manioc leaves during the dry season to eliminate the source of inoculum.\\nAlternatively, bury deep or burn any infected plants.\\nApply a crop rotation every 3 to 5 years to ensure that the pathogen will not survive anywhere on the field.\\nMaintain good hygiene with any tools involved in manioc cultivation.\\nDo not transport plant material from areas that are potentially infected.'},\n",

The first symptoms appear in spring as shoot and interveinal leaf chlorosis followed by a dieback of twigs and branches. Raised black points within lead- or ash-gray areas of withered twigs indicate spore masses. The growth of sprouts from the base of the affected branches and suckers from the rootstock are a very common response of the host to the disease. When the wood of infected twigs, branches or trunks is cut or stripped of bark, characteristic salmon-pink or orange-red discoloration of the wood may be seen. This internal symptom is associated with gum production within the vessels.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nFungicides based on copper can be used against the pathogen. The protectant copper fungicides will need to be applied repeatedly to the canopy during the period of greatest susceptibility from autumn to spring. Pseudomonas bacteria inhabiting the rhizosphere, for example Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida were also shown to inhibit the growth of Phoma tracheiphila in culture.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Products based on ziram (zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate) are very effective in the control of Phoma tracheiphila. Systemic products such as carboxin and benzimidazole are also effective as preventive treatments. A mixture of a protectant and a systemic fungicide is recommended, particularly after weather conditions such as a freeze, hailstorm, or strong winds that cause wounds to the tree.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe fungus enters through wounds in leaves, branches and roots. The spores are thought to be waterborne. The fungus can survive within infected twigs or branches in the soil for more than four months. This can be an important source of inoculum for several weeks.

Doubly infected plants show typical so-called 'tungro symptoms', including plant stunting and reduced tillering. Their leaves become yellow or orange-yellow starting from the leaf tip and extending to the lower part. Discoloured leaves may also have irregular, small, dark-brown blotches. Younger plants may show interveinal chlorosis. Milder symptoms are found with RTBV or RTSV alone (for example, very mild stunting and no yellowing of the leaves). The symptoms can be confused with Potassium deficiency, but Tungro occurs in patches in a field, whereas Potassium deficiency appears in the whole field.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nLight traps have successfully been used to attract and control the green leafhopper vectors as well as to monitor the population. In the early morning, the population of leafhopper alighting near the light trap should be caught and disposed of, alternatively killed by spraying/dusting insecticides. This should be practiced every day.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Spraying insecticides based on buprofezin or pymetrozine at 15 and 30 days after transplanting can work if done in a timely manner. However, the insects can move to surrounding fields and spread tungro rapidly in very short times. Therefore, the vegetation around the field should also be sprayed with the insecticides. Avoid products based on chlorpyriphos, lamda cyhalothrin or other synthetic pyrethroid combinations, to which the leafhoppers have become partly resistant.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nViruses are transmitted through a leafhopper called Nephotettix virescens. Tungro is rife in fields with high-yielding rice cultivars which have a shorter growth duration, allowing rice growers two crops of rice in a year. Once a rice plant is infected by tungro, it cannot be cured. Preventive measures are more effective than direct disease control. The double-cropping rice systems and the genetic uniformity of rice are major reasons why tungro disease appears in fields. Rice plants in irrigated areas are much more susceptible to develop the disease than rainfed or upland rice. Plant rests and stubbles are also a source of infection.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse varieties with some degree of resistance to the vector.\\nPlant two crops in the months when the vector population is low.\\nPractice crop rotation with non-host crops.\\nSchedule the planting to ensure nearly synchronous growth in each area.\\nDestroy the eggs and breeding sites through plowing.\\nAdopt alternate wetting and drying the field.\\nConserve beneficial insects.\"},\n",

Invasion by pathogens usually occurs at the point of injury to the berries, which could be caused by mechanical growth or cracks, injuries from insect or bird feeding, or lesions as a result of powdery mildew infections. Tight clusters and thin skins result in more susceptible cultivars. Favorable conditions such as warm moist conditions and sugar accumulation in berries encourage the fruit fly to lay hundreds of eggs. Pathogen occurs commonly in soils and is wind borne or splash borne to surfaces of fruit within the tree canopy. As fruits mature, they become more susceptible to sour rot infection. Disease development depends on high humidity and temperature above 10°C , with the optimum being 25-30°C, sour odour associated with the advanced stages of sour rot attract flies (drosophila spp.), which can disseminate the fungus and cause other injured fruit to become infected.

At the initial stage of fruit cracking, a brown stripe begins to appear on the surface of the fruit and the cuticles fracture. Then, a crack becomes visible, with the oil glands starting to deform. The oil glands suffer severe rupturing after which tissues of the fruit surface and the cells are severely damaged and there is a larger space among cells of the broken albedo.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nReduce heavy losses by extra attention before and during critical periods.

Spray treatments of potassium fertilizer, calcium fertilizer, and boron fertilizer to significantly decrease the creasing fruit. Apply potassium during the early fruit development to promote fruit peel development, increase peel thickness, enhance fruit cracking resistance ability and reduce pre-harvest fruit cracking.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDisorders can be developed post-harvest due to adverse environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and handling practices, while pre-harvest factors responsible for the disorders could be due to the deficiency of micronutrients such as boron, copper, and manganese. The fruit size and shape index also have certain effects on citrus fruit cracking. Larger fruits are more likely to experience the cracking phenomenon. The influence of rootstock on citrus fruit peel creasing and fruit cracking is indirect. Daily variations in the light exposure intensity positively correlate with the daily fruit creasing. The daily fruit creasing rate positively correlates with daily variation values in light intensity. The higher average relative humidity before the physiological fruit dropping period will increase the occurrence of fruit creasing. Insufficient nutrients in the partial peel will cause developmental and metabolic disorders in the peel.

Affected blossoms and young fruit drop prematurely, particularly those with a soft skin that is more vulnerable to damage. In addition, the pest produces abundant quantities of honeydew, that drops to underlying leaves. Because of its sugary content, it is readily colonized by the black sooty mold. Ants also feed on the honeydew and care for the aphids in exchange. The continuous feeding by the aphids and the reduced photosynthetic rates due to the mold coating weaken the trees. Young trees are particularly susceptible to this pest and they may show a stunted growth. The earlier the attack on the crop hosts, the more severe the symptoms. Fruit quality is also affected.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPredators of the spirea aphid include several species of flies, lacewings, ladybirds and hoverflies. Some parasitoid wasps of the family Aphidiidae also seem to attack A. spirea, but seldom complete their life cycle in the larvae, making them unreliable. Several pathogenic fungi also infect the aphid, but none have been used to reduce the pest’s damage previously.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Because young trees are more susceptible to the pest, treatments to reduce damage can be limited to those. Avoid to spray during periods of high temperatures and low humidity. Carbamates, some organophosphates, acetamiprid, pirimicarb and imidoclorid can be used to control the spirea aphid.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the polyphagous aphid Aphis spiraecola, also called Spirea aphid. Beside apple, citrus and papaya, it can infect an important number of crops as secondary hosts. Wild hosts include several species of the genus Crataegus (hawthorn) and Spiraea, thereby its common name. Its body is yellow to pale green and about 2 mm long. Three black protuberances stick out of the lower part of the abdomen. Adults and nymphs feed gregariously on leaves and branches, sucking the sap of the plant and producing abundant honeydew. This sugary substance may be later colonized by sooty mold. Temperature has a marked effect on its life cycle. For example, at 25ºC the pest can complete a generation within 7-10 days. However, high temperatures and low relative humidity are unfavorable for the pest. It also tolerate pretty well cold periods, explaining the sudden infestation of citrus groves in early spring after mild winters. Finally it is a vector of the tristeza virus and other plant virus that it can transmit between different hosts.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the orchards for signs of the aphids.\\nUse barriers to block the movements of ants.\\nUse monitoring systems such as water-sensitive paper to assess the presence of honeydew.\\nUse sticky traps to stop the ants.'},\n",

Young trees' upper roots and bark at ground level show signs of abrasion caused by sand corns (also known as sandblasting). Lesions leaves and stems are also caused by abrasion but damage there is much more significant. The growth rate and yield can be reduced by wind stress, visible in fewer or no fruits on the side of the tree exposed to wind. Later in the season young fruits (8mm in diameter) are most prone to wind damage. Single or multiple transverse or diagonal grayish scars are visible across the skin. In comparison with thrips damage, wind stress is characterized by small patches of clean tissue on the fruit, whereas thrips leave continuous scarring. Strong winds can break branches and bend or even overthrow trees.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nFirst evaluate the damage. According to its extent and the growth stage, determine if the trees can be salvaged. Remove damaged branches and fruits with cutting or pruning tools. During particularly wet weather, apply organic pastes where bacterial or fungal diseases are of concern.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatment if available. Treatments will depend on the growth stage and the severity of the damage. In severe cases, treatments should be focused on the prevention of fungal and bacterial diseases, for example with the clear-cutting of the damaged branches and the application of antifungal and antibacterial pastes.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by wind, and are particularly of concern in unprotected areas, with no windbreaks. If wind is frequent and/or strong, a large percentage of the citrus harvest may be qualitatively downgraded or rejected. Markings on young fruits are caused by older leaves being blown across the surface. The discoloration results as the formation off a protective, corky layer. Once fruit is about 3 cm in size, the skin has hardened, and damage is more likely to be caused by the scratching of dry twigs and branches. The damage to tissues is an opportunity for bacteria and fungus to enter and colonize the tissues and cause more damage. Specifically dry winds can damage trees through leaf fall, windburn and scorch, inevitably resulting in dying of leaves and scarring of fruits.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nInstall permanent or occasional windbreaks following wind speed, direction and frequency patterns.\\nPlant trees following the orientation of the wind.\\nMake sure to repair and manage windbreaks to protect trees.\\nKeep the soil moisture high when wind is forecast.\\nConsider also applying additional nitrogen to encourage new growth after major damage.\\nIn case of extreme wind gusts, or different wind directions, install several windbreaks.\\nSelective pruning following the direction of main wind is recommended.\\nAlso, do not forget to prune out dead wood after the harvest to avoid damage the following season.\"},\n",

Broccoli and cauliflower plants can be used as trap crops, sprayed with an insecticide, usually deltamethrin.

Pyrethroid insecticides can also be used for control of B. aeneus if there are no known cases of resistance to the chemical. However, pyrethroid insecticides also affect predatory organisms. Consider neonicotinoids, indoxacarb or pymetrozine as alternatives to pyrethroids.

They fly actively when temperatures exceed 12-15°C, often feeding on the pollen of any available flowers before locating their breeding hosts. Eggs are laid in buds at least 3 mm long. The larvae feed on pollen in flowers, taking 9-13 days to complete two larval instars. The full-grown larva then drops to the ground, burying itself in the soil.

Later, each larva web several flower buds together with silk threads, forming structures called \"glomerules\" visible to the naked eye. As they feed on the flowers inside their shelter, they produce abundant frass that is clearly visible to the naked eye. Second-generation larvae (mid summer) first feed externally on green berries. They later penetrate them and hollow them out, leaving only the skin and seeds. Third-generation larvae (late summer) cause the greatest damage by feeding inside the berries and within bunches, which then gradually dry. Silk threads are spun between the berries to prevent them from falling. The feeding damage exposes them to infection by several types of opportunistic fungi or attacks by insects e.g. raisin moth (Cadra figulilella), fruit flies, and ants. Larval damage on growing points, shoots or leaves is unusual.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeveral organic insecticides are recommended for use in grapes to control the populations of this pest. These include natural insect growth regulators, spinosyns, and solutions based on Bacillus thuringiensis. Parasitoids like some species of tachinid flies and several types of parasitic wasps (above 100) effectively can also be used to control L. botrana populations. Some species of parasitoids can cause up to 70% mortality in larvae of grape berry moth. These species may be introduced to the grapevine. Mating disruption by pheromone dispensing prevents the moths from mating.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Several broad-spectrum insecticides (organochlorines, carbamates, organophosphates and pyrethroids) can be used to control populations of L. botrana, but will also kill predatory species of the moth and their larvae. These measures need to be combined with biological or chemical control.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the caterpillars of the moth Lobesia botrana. Pupae overwinter inside silken cocoons under the bark, on the underside of dry leaves, in cracks on the soil or on vine debris. Adults have mosaic-patterned forewings, tan-cream in color, mottled with gray, brown, and black blotches. The second pair of wings is gray with a fringed border. Adults of the first generation emerge when air temperatures exceed a threshold of 10°C for a period of 10 to 12 days. Optimal development conditions are 26-29°C humidities ranging from 40 to 70%. Larvae perforates the flower envelopes to penetrates the bud and can even enter the peduncle of the bunch of grapes, causing it to dry. Older caterpillars web fruit together with silk threads, then nibble them or penetrate them.

Despite its name, it is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and, beside the Mediterranean area, it is also present in the Middle East, South and Central America and Australia. The female pierces the soft skin of ripening fruit or berries and lay eggs in the puncture hole, below the skin. After hatching, the larvae feed inside the fruit pulp and usually inflict severe damage that can make it inedible. It is a polyphagous insect, meaning that it feeds on a large range of hosts. It can also easily infest new hosts if the favorite plants are not within reach. There is also evidence that it could transport opportunistic fungi that grow on the attacked fruits.

       "  'data': 'Dead Arm\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThis disease is characterized by the internal rot of the trunk. As the disease progresses over the years, one or more arms may die, thereby the name \"deadarm\". Cross-sections of the trunk show a wedge-shaped canker of the internal tissues. Fungal growth can sometimes be observed forming charcoal patches on the bark of the dead wood. This disease may also present symptoms on leaves. These include the spotting of leaf blade and the subsequent formation of chlorotic patches and necrotic margins. Deformation and cupping of the lamina ensue. Internodes are shortened and shoots grow stunted and chlorotic. Bunches may not initiate or simply do not develop and drop.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nCommercial formulations based on Bacillus subtilis can be applied to the pruning wounds for protection. Copper-based products applied topically after pruning will also prevent fungal infection on open wounds.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatment if available. Myclobutanil, thiophanate-methyl and tetraconazole have been used to control trunk canker diseases including Eutypa dieback. They can be applied preventively immediately after pruning. Wound sealant with 5% boric acid in acrylic paint or essential oils also work fine.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused by the fungus Eutypa lata, and is usually observed on older vineyards or orchards. The primary sources of infection are the fungal spores overwintering in contaminated trunks. In the spring, the release of these spores is favored by rain splashes and they are spread to the unfolded buds via wind. There, they enter the plant either through wounds or probably also directly through the stomatal pores. Once inside the wood, it spreads slowly and, over the years, can affect the vascular tissue. At advanced stages, it can completely girdle the shoots or branches, blocking water and nutrient transport to the upper parts of the vine or tree. Optimal temperatures for spore germination range from 20 °C to 25 °C. Eutypa lata can also infect apple, pear, and cherry trees as well as walnuts. An long series of trees such as mountain ash, cork oak or blackthorn complete the list of hosts and can act as a reservoir of inoculum.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the field for signs of the disease and mark infected vines for removal.\\nBe sure to remove and destroy old vine residues in the field.\\nAvoid pruning during and after wet weather.\\nCut the infected branch under the canker and allow the growth of a new healthy shoot.\\nDelayed pruning or double pruning are also effective methods to lower the infection.'},\n",

The larvae bore holes into the stem and carve it out, which leads ultimately to death. The fully grown larva is about 20 mm long and has a reddish-brown head and a white body which can also be black-spotted. The adult moth has a wingspan of about 8 to 15 mm with white wings. The eggs of the stem borer are laid in batches on the leaf and have a yellow color.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nYou can reduce the population of Stem Borers with the help of pheromone bait traps. The traps should be placed along fences (especially if they are made out of millet stems or other grasses) and granaries. Applied early in the season on infested plants, neem oil can be effective against Stem Borers. The ‘push-pull’ method can be very effective: Crops like Desmodium can be intercropped with millet. Desmodium acts as a repellent, so the moths are ‘pushed’ away from the millet. You can plant field trap crops like Napier or Sudan grass on the border of your plantation. These crops will attract the moths, so they are ‘pulled’ away from the millet.\\nChemical Control\\nInsecticides are often difficult to use as well as expensive. Dimethoate can be used but rarely justifies the costs.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nIn wet regions there are three generations of larvae per year, while in dry regions two cycles occur. The Stem Borer carves out the stem, so the flow of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant is impeded.

Twigs may show a stunted growth. Fruits develop discoloration and lesions that prevents further normal development. In case of severe infections, the skin eventually turns dark brown, with the surface becoming leathery and hard, often subjected to cracks. Hosts include apricot, sour cherries and peach.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nProducts based on the antagonist fungus Ampelomyces quisqualis and the bacteria Bacillus subtilis have been used as biological agents to control Podosphaera pannosa. Several organic fungicides are also available in the form of horticultural oils, neem oil, jojoba oil, potassium bicarbonate and bicarbonate of soda.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Formulations based on thiophanate-methyl, propiconazole and sulfur fungicides have been recommended for powdery mildews in general, including powdery mildew of rose. Other products that have been used with some success include dinitrophenols and compounds based on pyridine and pyrimidine.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused on roses and stone fruits by the fungus Podosphaera pannosa, which survives the winter in a circular, spore-producing structure. Under favorable conditions in spring, this structure breaks open and releases spores that are later spread by wind, insects, and rain. When they land on a susceptible host and germinates, they start producing the characteristic “powdery” appearance on leaves or fruits. Optimal conditions for powdery mildew of rose are 16-27 °C, with the optimal temperature for fungal growth at 23 °C. Shaded areas are also preferred since the prolonged exposure to light reduces its growth. Moreover, these fungi do not need moisture to germinate and infect their hosts. In fact, prolonged leaf moisture inhibits rather than promotes fungal growth. The use of silicon as part of a fertilization program can also reduce the occurrence of powdery mildew.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nThe selection of resistant varieties is crucial to avoid fungal growth and development of symptoms.\\nMonitor the orchards for signs of the disease.\\nChoose location well exposed to the sun and with good aeration.\\nComplement the fertilization program with silicon.\\nAvoid irrigating in late afternoon or evening.\\nKeep weeds and grasses under control under trees with low hanging branches.\\nPrune trees in a way that allow a good ventilation of the canopy.'},\n",

The pathogen may be carried in or on infested seed. In the absence of host plants, it can overwinter for up to one year or more on infected crop residue. In spring, when the conditions are favorable, spores are produced, which serve as the primary source of infection. Moisture, relative humidity over 85 percent, rainfall and duration of leaf wetness (from 1 to 10 hours) are determining for a successful infection and the development of symptoms. The optimal temperature for the disease varies depending on the speices in question and varies from about 24°C in watermelon and cucumber to about 18°C in muskmelon. Penetration by spores is probably directly through the epidermis and does not need to occur through stomata or wounds.

To confirm the presence of termites, it is necessary to pull out the affected plants and examine the roots and lower stem for live insects or the presence of tunnels. Plant roots and stems may be completely hollowed out and filled with soil waste. Some plants lodge during strong wind and they are often covered with soil, under which termites may be found. It is important to examine plants in the early morning or late evening, as termites may have moved deeper into the soil during the day when temperatures are higher.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPreparations based on nematodes that attack termites are effective against this pest. Solutions containing the fungi Beauveria bassiana or some species of Metarhizium are effective when applied into the termite hill. Fungi spores can also act as repellents.

Effective contact insecticides include fipronil, imidacloprid, or acetamiprid, which in many products are combined with piperonyl butoxide to enhance their effect.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nLarvae and adults feed on plant tissues. Thrips are 1-2 mm long, yellow, black or both in color. Some varieties have two pairs of wings, while others do not have wings at all. They hibernate in plant residues or in the soil or on alternative host plants. They are also vectors for a broad range of viral diseases. Thrips infest a broad variety of plants. Dry and warm weather conditions favor population growth, while humidity reduces it. Adults can be easily carried by wind, clothes, equipment, and containers not properly cleaned after fieldwork.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resistant varieties.\\nUse virus- and thrips-free transplants from certified greenhouses and plant nurseries.\\nAvoid planting susceptible plants next to weedy areas and alternative hosts.\\nAdd plastic or organic mulch along the rows to reduce the incidence and progression of thrips.\\nMonitor fields regularly.\\nUse sticky traps over a large area for mass-catching.\\nPrune by cutting plants just above branching points and nodes instead of shearing off terminals.\\nKeep plants well irrigated, and avoid excessive applications of nitrogen fertilizer.\\nRemove infected plants and any plant debris and destroy them.\"},\n",

Initial symptoms on potato tubers are small, slightly raised, purplish-brown pustules, circular in shape and smooth and spongy in appearance. As they increase in size, they coalesce and form large, irregular lesions on the potato skin. They later burst, rupturing the skin of the potato tuber and forming corky shallow cankers known as scab. Swellings, galls or warts develop, deforming the potatoes significantly and making them unmarketable. In high moisture soils, lesions expand inwards, forming deep pits and destroying a large portion of internal tissues. The anomalies may continue to grow during storage.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNo alternative treatment against this pathogen is available, so be sure to apply preventive measures.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Drenching of soils with metam sodium or fluazinam work well in some cases, mostly depending on the environmental conditions and the type of soil.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nPowdery scab is caused by a soil borne pathogen (Spongospora subterranea) that can survive up to 6 years in soils. The disease is common in cool temperatures (12 to 18°C) and heavy, acidic soils, that are prone to water-logging. Alternating periods of wet and dry weather can also favor its development. Infected seed tubers, clothing, tools or manure can be carriers of the pathogen. The infection happens at tuber initiation through the lenticels, eyes or wounds of the tubers. Russet potato varieties are somwhat more tolerant to this disease and show fewer symptoms of damage. Powdery scab can infect several members of the solanaceous family, for example tomato.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCheck with seed retailer on resilient varieties.\\nUse healthy seeding material from certified sources.\\nImplement a well-coordinated crop rotation.\\nPlant in well-drained soils that are not susceptible to water-logging.\\nCheck for alternative hosts of the solanaceous family in and around the field and eradicate them.\\nApply sulfur to your soils to control pH.\\nTake special care of the disinfection of your equipment, clothes and tools.\\nDo not apply manure from animals that have been fed scabby potatoes.\\nDeep plow and soil solarization after harvest also help.'},\n",

Infected kernels can be partially or completely smutted. Black pustules of spores push through the glumes, which may swell from the moisture of overnight dew. The spores shed from infected grain settle on other plant parts, forming a characteristic black covering that aids in the detection of the disease.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBest biosecurity actions should be put in place to prevent entry, establishment, and spread of the pests and disease. Bioagents like Bacillus Pumilus is very effective against the fungus of Tilletia barclayana.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available.

Apply Propiconazole containing fungi at the boot growth stage to minimize the amount of infection. Fungicides such as Azoxystrobin, Trifloxystrobin can also be applied.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused by the fungus Tilletia barclayana, which is also known as Neovossia horrida. The fungus survives as black spores by replacing the rice kernel. They can be borne by winds and re-infect rice panicles both within a crop and its neighboring crops. The disease spreads when spores of the fungus are transported on infected and contaminated grain, machinery and equipment. Spores of kernel smut of rice are also able to float on water and maybe spread this way. The spores can survive for at least 3 years on grains and even survive the passage through the digestive tract of animals. The fungal development is favored by high temperatures and humidity.

Products based on azoxystrobin or captan or combinations of fungicides are effective against the fungus.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by Magnaporthiopsis maydis, a fungus that overwinters in the soil and potentially also on seeds. The soil- or seedborne spores infect the roots of seedlings via small wounds and gradually colonize the tissues as they develop. In the vessels, they are translocated from the roots up the stalk and into the ear and grains.

Spots are characterized by gray centers and brown margins and often merge to form rotting and then discoloration of the leaf sheaths. In severe infections, the young panicles may not emerge. Affected leaf sheaths may have abundant whitish powdery fungal growth visible on the outer surface. Grains of emerged panicles become discolored and sterile. Un-emerged panicles produce florets that turn red-brown to dark brown. Infection is most damaging when it occurs at late booting stages and can cause severe damage.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBacteria such Rhizobacteria of Pseudomonas fluorescens isolated from citrus and rice are toxic to the rice sheath rot fungus, resulting in lesser incidence and more yield. Bipolaris zeicola is another potential antagonist of sheath rot that can completely inhibit mycelial growth of S. oryzae. Antifungal activity of extracts from leaves and flowers of Tagetes erecta also inhibit S. oryzae mycelium by 100%.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. In case of severe infestation, the application of fungicides such as mancozeb, copper oxychloride or propiconazole (usually 1 ml/l of water) during booting and panicle emergence at weekly intervals can reduce the incidence of the disease. Application of a seed treatment fungicide like mancozeb before sowing is also effective.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSheath rot is principally a seed-borne disease. The disease is caused principally by the fungus Sarocladium oryzae but also in some cases by Sacroladium attenuatum. The fungi survive on rice crop residue after harvest and can cause infection in following seasons. Its incidence increases with increasing planting density and in plants that provide entry points for the fungus, in the form of injuries and wounds caused by insects at panicle initiation stage. The application of potassium, calcium sulphate or zinc fertilizers at the tillering stage strengthen the stem and leaf tissues and thus avoid extensive damage. It is also associated with plants weakened by virus infections.

Both adults and larvae can damage the plants or trees by feeding on the roots. The adults are dark brown, about 20 mm long and 8 mm wide. Within three to four days after the onset of rain, they emerge from the soil, fly short distances and feed on the surrounding plants. After feeding, they reenter the soil to hide and lay their eggs. Female lays 20-80 white and roundish eggs singly at a depth of 5-8 cm in the soil. The larvae are whitish yellow, translucent and about 5 mm long. The fully grown grubs are stout with strong mandibles. Their head is yellowish and the white colored body is fleshy and 'C' shaped.

The infection of blossoms can take place early in the season and the pathogen remains latent in the developing fruits. A soft brown or dark brown rot gradually develops on the fruit. This is followed by the appearance of gray to tan pustules on its surface, especially if the fruit was wounded previously or if humid weather conditions are prevailing. In low humidity, pustules may not develop at all and the fruit eventually shrivels. Infected blossoms and leaves turn brown and wither, producing a typical blighted appearance. Stem infections lead to brown, collapsed areas (cankers), often with exudation of surface gum. Gray specks, corresponding to fungal structures, also appear on these infected tissues under humid conditions.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nVarious alternative methods have been tried for postharvest control. Biofungicides based on the bacteria Bacillus subtilis gives as effective control of the fungi in stored fruits. Other treatments tested include various kinds of ultraviolet irradiation, hot water treatments and fumigation with various short-chain fatty acids (acetic, propionic). A large scale use of these methods have not been carried out so far.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Preharvest fungicide applications are recommended from the flowering period when disease risk is high. Fungicide formulations containing thiophanate-methyl, iprodione have been used effectively against M. fructicola. Some degree of resistance has been observed for some of these products. A post-harvest fungicide treatment of the fruits previous to storage and handling can reduce the development of the disease after harvest (preferably using a different fungicide).\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Monilinia fruticola and partly by the related species M. laxa and M. fructigena. The former tends to occur more often on peaches and nectarines, whereas the latter fungi favor apricots, plum, cherry and almonds. Even though apple and pear trees can also be affected by these fungi, in these trees it is mainly M. fructigena that causes this kind of symptoms. The fungus overwinters in the mummified fruits in the tree or the orchard floor, or in twig cankers. In spring, it resumes growth, produces and release spores that will then infect healthy blossoms, fruits and twigs during the whole season. The usual entry points are either wounds on the tissues or, in the case of fruits, infected blossoms. In the latter case, the pathogen remain latent during fruit development and impact may not be seen until the fruits reach maturity. Warm temperature and prolonged periods of leaf wetness are conducive for spore release and infection and lead thus to greater disease incidence. Crop losses due to the disease can occur pre- or postharvest, during storage or transportation.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nSelect varieties that are less susceptible to the disease.\\nUse healthy plant material, if possible from certified sources.\\nPlant the trees to have as much exposition to the sun.\\nUse pruning methods that allow for a optimal ventilation of the trees.\\nRemove mummified fruits and infected material (blossoms, twigs) during the growing season.\\nDo not process, transport or market fruits or planting material from diseased orchards.'},\n",

The natural pores on leaves or the lenticels on bark are the entry points for the bacteria. However, the bacterium dies when the young trees are transplanted into groves, and symptoms gradually disappear. Warm temperatures (14 to 38 °C) with light rains, heavy dews, and windy weather are most conducive for disease development and spread. By contrast, the growth of the bacterium and the infection process is impaired when the weather is hot and dry.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse healthy planting material from a certified source.\\nSelect varieties with some degree of resistance to the disease.\\nAvoid low-lying or shaded sites with poor air circulation and soil drainage.\\nPrune trees to allow for a better air circulation and to maintain tree vigor.\\nEnsure a good vitality in young plantations.\\nUse artificial or natural windbreaks with fast-growing trees to reduce tissue damages by blowing soil particles due to strong winds.\\nDo not work in the orchards or prune when foliage is wet with rain or dew.\\nRemove infected shoots by pruning a few centimeters below the symptoms on the bark.\\nControl pests that could damage the leaves and promote the infection, such as leaf miners.\\nDisinfect equipments and tools after field work.\\nCheck for possible quarantine regulations in your country.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Paddy Swarming Caterpillar\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe caterpillars feed on plants and cause injury in the form of shot holes on leaf blades, skeletonized leaves and stem dieback. In severe cases, entire swarms may invade the transplanted plots in large numbers and devastate the crop overnight, similar to how cattle might. The swarming caterpillars damage paddy crop by cutting off leaf tips, leaf margins, and even the plants at the base. The damage is more severe on seedlings in nursery, direct seeded crops and rice in early tillering stage. After having devastated a crop, the swarm of larvae migrate to another field in what looks like a regular army formation. In the last decade, it has emerged as a serious pest of rice seedlings that can cause losses from 10 to 20%.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIn small areas, ducks can be released in the field to feed on the larvae. Adults can also be eliminated by introducing Bolas spiders, which has the ability to produce a pheromone similar to female moth. This attracts male moths and results in less mating. The nematode Steinernema carpocapsae and usage of spray solutions containing Nucleopolyhedrovirus are also effective against the paddy swarming caterpillar.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with both preventive measures and biological treatments if available. The field edges may be dusted with insecticides in the early stages of infection to avoid the migration of the caterpillars. The application of contact insecticides based on chlropyriphos also controls the caterpillars effectively.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the paddy swarming caterpillar, Spodoptera mauritia. This polyphagous species can occasionally cause serious losses to rice crop. Moths are ashy gray and have a wingspan of about 40 mm. Females are nocturnal in habit and mate just 24 hours after their emergence. One day after mating, they start to lay eggs in batches of about 200-300 on various types of grasses, weeds and rice leaves. The larvae feed on leaf tissues and undergo six larval stages that can bring them to a final length of 3.8 cm. The fully grown larvae are smooth, cylindrical and have a largely pale body with dorsal stripes. Two rows of C-shaped black spots are visible along their back. They feed during the night and hide in the soil in day time. Pupation takes place in a cocoon dug in the soil.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the field regularly for infestations.\\nCollect caterpillars with a hand net or sweeping basket to reduce the number.\\nDeep plow the fields in summer to kill pupae.\\nRemove excess nursery plants and weeds from the field and surroundings.\\nEnsure alternate flooding and drying of the fields to break the life cycle of the pest.\\nAvoid excess use of nitrogen.\\nCrop rotation with non-host plants helps to eliminate the disease.\\nMoths traps can also used to collect adults.\\nIn case of severe attack, isolate the field by trenching and destroy the crop by plowing.\\nCaterpillars and pupae can then be picked up by predator birds.'},\n",

Over time, the mold spread superficially on the skin and older parts at the center become bluish or greenish. The neighboring tissues become soft and water-soaked or colonized in turn by a broad band of white mycelium. The fruit rapidly spoils and collapses, or in lower humidities shrinks and mummifies.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBiological control of the fungi can be achieved with the use of formulations based on the Pseudomonas syringae strain ESC-10. Extracts from the plant Ageratum conzyoides are also effective against the molds. An 'essential oil' from the herb Thymus capitatus and neem oil have a similar effect. Tea saponin is regarded as a safe compound and has also been used to control postharvest decay of citrus fruit.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Washing harvested fruits at 40-50°C with detergents or weak alkali solutions, usually including some fungicides, reduces fruit decay. Recommended fungicidal compounds are imazalil, thaibendazole and biphenyl.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nTwo species of fungi belonging to the genus Penicillium cause these destructive rots of citrus fruits. P. italicum and P. digitatum grow on the fruit's skin as bluish mold and greenish mold respectively. The lesions of the former usually spread more slowly than those caused by the latter. Their development is also characterized by a band of younger white mycelium that surrounds the older growth in the center. These fungi are opportunist and take advantage of wounds on the fruit surface to start their life cycle. The spores germinate with the release of water and nutrients from the site of injury. At the optimal temperature of 24 °C, the infection takes place within 48 hours and initial symptoms become visible within 3 days. Transmission can occur mechanically or via the water- or air-borne dispersal of spores. These spores often reside in the soil but can also be found in the air of contaminated storage spaces.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nTake care to minimize fruit injury during fruit work.\\nRemove infected fruit from the orchard.\\nDiscarded fruits should be kept away from the packing area.\\nKeep fruits cool during storage to avoid the development of the disease.\\nStore fruit in high humidity/ low temperature conditions.\\nUse disinfectants to clean equipment in packing and storage facilities.\\nDo not harvest during or following rainfalls.\"},\n",

These correspond to the site of egg deposition by females. Hardened, amber-colored secretions seem to drop from these areas. Larvae hatch and bore through the flesh to reach the seeds. Mango stones show holes and the interior core of the fruit may turn into a black, rotten mass. Infestation can result in early fruit drop and reduced germination capacity of seeds. In rare instances, for example in some late-maturing varieties, adults may exit the seed and tunnel through the fruit. This leaves scars on the fruit peel that attract secondary infections and ruins the fruit.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe ant Oecophylla smaragdina can be used as biocontrol agent against the adults. Hot and cold treatments can kill the insect at various stages of its development on fruits. Some viruses also affect the larvae of S. mangiferae.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatmetns if available. Successful control can be achieved by two sprays of deltamethrin, the first when fruits are 2-4 cm in size and the second 15 days later. Insecticide sprays based on several active ingredients are highly effective in preventing S. mangiferae infestations.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nAdult mango nut weevil is an oval-shaped beetle with an elongated head that forms a snout. Female lay creamy-white, elliptical eggs singly on half mature (green) to ripe mango fruit. The puncture point is characterized by an incision on the fruit peel along with a light brown secretion. After 5-7 days, 1 mm long larvae hatch and tunnel through the flesh to reach the mango seeds. Usually, one larva is found feeding on each stone, sometimes up to 5. In some rare cases, the larvae will feed and pupate in the pulp. Adults usually emerge after fruits fall and undergo a period of suspended growth until new fruits appear on trees. When mangoes reach pea-size, they become active again and start feeding on leaves and mating. Long-range spreading of the bugs occurs through the transport of fruit, seeds, seedlings and/or cuttings containing larvae, pupae or adults.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCollect seeds from healthy plants or from certified sources.\\nGrow varieties with fruits resistant to penetration by larvae.\\nSeeds may be shelled and inspected for possible damage.\\nDig the soil in direct vicinity of trees regularly to expose insect to predators.\\nRemove scattered stones and fallen fruits from the ground.\\nBagging of fruits prevents bugs from depositing eggs.\\nBe careful not to transport infested seeds or mango fruits to other areas.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Alternaria Leaf Blight\\n\\nSymptoms\\nYoung plants are resistant to the pathogen. The lowermost leaves are always the first to show signs of infection, which gradually spreads to the upper leaves. Infection begins as small, oval, chlorotic lesions which are irregularly scattered on the lowermost leaves, gradually spreading to the upper leaves. Over time, the lesions enlarge, become irregular in shape and develop into dark brown or grey sunken lesions. Lesions may have a bright yellow marginal zone and can grow up to 1cm or more in diameter. Under moist conditions, lesions may be covered by black powdery conidia. At later stages of the disease, lesions will merge together resulting in the death of the entire leaf. In severe cases, leaf sheaths, awns and glumes are also affected and have a burnt appearance.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeedborne infections can be controlled by treating seed with vitavax @ 2.5 per kg seed. A mixture of Trichoderma viride and vitavax effectively hinder further infections (by 98.4%). Mix Urea @ 2 - 3% with Zineb at first and second sprays. Apply aqueous Neem Leaf extracts. Fungicide and hot water treatments have been used to reduce seedborne inoculum. Pathogens Trichoderma viride (2%) and T. harzianum(2%), Aspergillus humicola and Bacillus subtilis are often used to control further outbreak of the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. A. triticina can be controlled through the application of fungicides with a 75% reduction in disease severity and an increase in plant yield. Apply fungicides such as mancozeb, ziram, zineb (0.2%), thiram, fytolan, propineb, chlorothalonil and nabam, propiconazole (0.15%), tebuconazole, and hexaconazole (0.5%). To prevent developing tolerance to mancozeb, apply a combination of fungicides.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the fungus Alternaria triticina. Infection is both soilborne and seedborne and can be dispersed by wind. Infected seeds may be smaller than healthy ones and are often shriveled, with brown discoloration. Plants are affected when planted into infected soils or getting in contact with infested crop residues (e.g., by rain splashes or by direct contact). The fungus survives reportedly two months in infected debris on the soil surface during summer, but four months in buried debris. Susceptibility increases with plant age as A. triticina is unable to infect young wheat seedlings which are under about four weeks of age. The symptoms are usually not evident until the plants are about seven weeks of age. Temperatures of 20 - 25°C are optimal for infection and disease development. Under severe conditions, yield losses may exceed 80%.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse less-susceptible varieties as well as healthy seeds from certified sources.\\nPractice the best hygiene measures.\\nInfected crops should be destroyed by burning and ploughing.\\nThis will prevent aerial dispersal of the pathogen via infected crop residues.\\nHerbicides can be used to destroy the infected crops.\\nInfested fields should not be resown for a minimum of two years.\\nDisposable equipment, infected plant material or soil should be disposed of by autoclaving, high-temperature incineration or deep burial.\\nAny equipment removed from the site for disposal should be double-bagged.\\nDeeply incorporate crop debris after harvest to reduce pathogen survival and primary inoculum that could incite future epidemics.\\nPromote air movement within the canopy by planting rows parallel to prevailing wind direction, reducing plant population and planting on wider row spacing.\\nAvoid irrigating near dusk and following overhead irrigation, if possible to reduce periods of leaf wetness.\\nApply adequate fertilizers.'},\n",

On leaves, they include tip discoloration, streaks, and development of yellow patches. However, the most conspicuous sign of all is the contrasting yellow and green mottling on the foliage. In some cases, the areas of dark green tissue become raised over the surrounding yellow tissue. The clearing of vein may also occur in some crops. Leaves may deform as a consequence of uneven growth, and margin can curl downward. Even though pods do not seem to be directly affected, they often are less developed or deformed and have fewer seeds. Overall, plants present a stunted growth.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nControl of aphid populations is essential to control the transmission of bean mosaic virus. Check the underside of the leaves for aphids and, if found, treat immediately with an insecticidal soap, neem oil or organic products based on pyrethroids. Predators feeding on aphids can also be used.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. There are no treatments against viruses and a full control of the population of aphids is difficult. In fact, aphids are not killed rapidly enough to prevent virus spreading. Mineral oil (1%), either used alone or mixed with insecticides, considerably reduce the spread of the virus. However, they are expensive and treatments must be repeated frequently to protect newly developing shoots. Plant yield can also be reduced.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV). Often there is a co-infection with other viruses, explaining the variety of symptoms, for example Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). In addition to beans, it can also infect other important legume crops such as peanuts, soybeans, broad beans. Several species of clover, alfalfa and lupine can also serve as overwintering hosts. Other non-leguminous host plants include some flowers, like the gladiolus. The virus is mainly transmitted from plant to plant via an insect vector, although there is some suspicion that it could also be seed-borne. More than twenty species of aphids can carry it in a non-persistent manner. It can also spread via grafting with contaminated plant parts or mechanical inoculation.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to plant healthy seeds or plants from certified sources.\\nUse resistant plants, if available.\\nIncrease plant density to make the canopy more dense.\\nMake sure not to plant beans near alfalfa, clover, or other legumes or flowers such as gladiolus.\\nUse of cereal strips around the field as a barrier crop.\\nUse plastic or organic mulch to disrupt the life cycle of the aphids.\\nKeep the fields and surrounding clear of weed.\\nKeep the use of insecticides low in order to promote beneficial insects.\\nPlan a crop rotation, especially if the field has an history of infection in the past.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Citrus Rust Mite\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms vary based on crop variety and fruit maturity. Usually, Citrus Rust Mites are first noticed as bronzing on the skin of mature orange fruits, leaves, and branches. Feeding damage can be observed on green stems, leaves, and fruits. The mites live and inject saliva on both leaf surface and on fruit skin, causing the epidermal skin cells to disintegrate. The upper cuticle looses its glossy nature, and becomes dull and bronze-like or show yellow patches in areas of russeting. Initially, lower leaf surfaces appear as pale patches, and later as necrotic spots. The feeding destroys the rind cells and the surface becomes silvery on lemons, rust brown on mature oranges, and black on green oranges. This is called \"russeting\" when rust mite injury happened early in the season and \"bronzing\" when mature fruits are injured. The injured surface is smooth and dark brown in color, and the blemishes become more severe if they hang on the tree longer. Infested fruit appears smaller when injured before fruit maturity. A heavy infestation can cause severe damage in young trees. When Citrus Rust Mite feeds on fruit during the early spring season, the peel turns rough in texture with a lighter color than during summer. This is referred to as sharkskin.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe use of predatory mites such as Euseius citrifolius, Pronematus unbiquitus, and Amblyseius species and parasitic fungus, Hirsutella thompsonii to attack rust mites, helps to keep the population of citrus mites in control. Foliar spray based on oil (3 tablespoons of cooking oil with 4 litres of water and half a tablespoon of detergent soap) or soap solution spray (2 tablespoons of soap/washing liquid with 4 litres of water) can reduce the mite infestation. Don\\'t apply oil spray when temperatures exceed 35°C. Spray the underside of leaves and re-spray after 3 to 4 weeks if necessary.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments, if available. Take action when more than 30% of trees are infested. Choose your chemical treatment carefully as it might also affect beneficial insects. All miticides should be used only once a year to minimize resistance development. Pesticides such as Spirodiclofen, Diflubenzuron, Abamectin, Acequinocyl, Spirotetramat, micronized or wettable Sulphur, Fenpyroximate, and Chlorpyrifos can be used to eliminate the mite community.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the feeding activities of adult Rust Mite. It is characterized as microscopic in nature and barely visible to the naked eye. It is obvious only when present in large numbers on the fruit or leaf surface. It gives the appearance of powder dust. White, spherical eggs are laid in small groups on the surface of the leaves or fruits. The egg is then followed by two active nymph stages before turning into an adult mite. One generation of mites can be completed in six days at 30°C. Females live for four to six weeks laying 30 eggs in a lifetime. The frequent presence of isolated blemished fruit is the first sign of Rust Mite infestation in an orchard. When this is noted during a particular season, it must be regarded as a serious Rust Mite warning for the following season. This pest prefers humid conditions and is very common during tropical and subtropical climates. Mites can spread from tree to tree by the wind.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nSelect tolerant varieties, if available.\\nMonitor the orchard with a hand lens for infestation symptoms.\\nMaintain suitable conditions for predatory species such as other insects and birds.\\nMaintain good air circulation by pruning within the trees.\\nControl weed population within the orchard by uprooting them.'},\n",

Considerable damage can occur inside the flesh (frass contamination, rotting). Small, discolored patches may develop on the fruit skin, where oviposition took place. The lesions, inflicted by the laying of eggs, make the fruits susceptible to secondary infections by opportunistic fungi and bacteria.

Wrap developing fruits with a protective cover or use traps baited with pheromones or protein (e.g. methyl eugenol which attracts male flies). Leaf extracts of ocimum sanctum (holy basil), which contain eugenol, beta-caryophyllene and beta-elemene, attract flies from a distance of 0.8 km when placed on cotton pads. Spraying these components combined with spinosad as poison will punctually kill flies in the orchard. Neem seed kernel extracts can be used as an oviposition deterrent.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Insecticides are moderatley effective against the fruit fly. Sprays should be mixed with protein baits, luring the flies to specific positions.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nEggs are laid in groups under the skin of young fruits. Maggots are 10-12 mm long when fully grown, and cause damage by boring into the pulp of fruits. Pupation lasts 10 days, usually taking place in the soil, but occasionally in the fruits as well. The pupa develops in an oval, brown and 6-8 mm long nest. In very dry areas the pupae may enter diapause. Adults are 8-10 mm long with a dark brown head and three bright yellow stripes on the back.

       "  'data': 'Red Palm Mite\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe red palm mites are usually found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves (100-300 individuals) and are visible with the naked eye. All life stages are predominantly red, while adult females often exhibit dark areas on the body (visible with a magnifying glass). Numerous white skins shed by the developing adults are also found among the living mites. Their presence on leaflets or leaves initially causes localized yellowing of the margins, which may spread parallel to the veins to form large chlorotic patches. Over time, necrotic lesions may form and replace the yellowing tissues. The lower leaflets of palms are usually more severely affected. Heavy infestations on banana and plantain may result in the death of the young plants.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe predatory mite Amblyseius largoensis can be indroduced in the plantation and can help to reduce the population of red palm mites. Other predatory mites and lady beetles also feed on R. indica. Therefore it is important not to disrupt natural populations of these predators by an abuse of broad-scale pesticides.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Formulations of spiromesifen, and acequinocyl were effective in reducing the population of R. indica in coconut in Puerto Rico. Spray treatments with products containing etoxanole, abamectin, pyridaben, milbemectin and sulfur showed mite control in Florida. In addition, the acaricides acequinocyl and spiromesifen were able to reduce the population of R. indica in banana trials.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the red palm mite Raoiella indica. They belong to the group of the so-called \"false spider mites\", characterized by the flat body and the absence of webbing associated with numerous other spider mites. They feed on plants by inserting their stylet-like structure into plant tissue and removing the cell contents. These mite are easily distributed by wind currents or movement of infested plants through nursery stock and cut branches of plants. Populations are negatively affected by rainfall and high relative humidity and are highest during hot, sunny and dry conditions. Beside banana, the red palm mite is also a pest of several fruit-producing palm species such as coconut, date and areca palms and ornamental palms. Some ornomental palms complete the list of hosts.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure not to move infested plant material between banana plantations.\\nControl the use of insecticides to allow beneficial insects to thrive.\\nMonitor the plantation regularly for symptoms of the pest.\\nMaintain a high standard of hygiene for tools and workers.\\nRemove alternative hosts of the pest in and around the orchard.'},\n",

The damage often begins from the tip of the leaves where the eggs are initially laid. They then move to the edges of the leaf and eat a lot of it. As they grow, they eat the whole leaf, starting at the tip and leaving only the middle part of the leaf with visible marks. As a result, the plants are not able to photosynthesize properly, leading to reduced yields in crops. If the attacked plant has fruits they can drop before maturity. Caterpillars can be spotted feeding in groups. Excrement (frass) of the caterpillars is visible.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo control the pest without chemicals, physically removing the caterpillars from affected plants is an option. This should be done using a pair of tweezers or a piece of tape, without touching them directly. Light traps can also be set up to trap and collect adult moths. About 5 light traps may be installed per hectare to effectively control the pest.\\nChemical Control\\nSelect the appropriate insecticide for your specific situation, following the label instructions carefully, and wearing protective clothing and gloves when applying it. Spray only if the infestation is severe.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the Blue-Striped Nettle Grub. They are mostly tropical and can be present all year round. This moth goes through several stages in their life cycle. It starts with the eggs that are laid on the leaves of plants. Once hatched, the young caterpillars begin to feed on the leaves. During growth, they renew their skin several times and replace it with new one. Eventually, they form a cocoon around themselves and pupate. After a period of time, adult moths emerge from the cocoons and start the cycle again. The grubs of this insect have green bodies with three pale blue stripes and grow to be 3-4 cm long. The cocoons look like large seeds with a hard papery shell covered in silk. Female and male moths have a similar colour pattern. They have a yellowish-green head, reddish-brown body, dark red-brown legs and a brown edge on the outer part of the wing.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nInfestations are initially limited in one area.\\nThe caterpillars can be collected by hand and destroyed.\\nLook for the cocoons in the same area and destroy them too.\\nLook on the trunk, on the leaves and on the ground.\\nCocoons are usually laid side by side.\\nPurchase plant material only from clean, accredited suppliers, and preferably material that is certified.\\nBlue-striped nettle grub may be moved to new places through plant material contaminated with eggs or larvae.'},\n",

The effectiveness of insecticidal control can be improved by taking advantage of the times when the pest is active and not hidden within the foliage. Therefore, the insecticides can come into direct contact with them. The stink bug is observed to feed during early morning and late afternoon.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by a bug called Nezara viridula, which is found all over the world, especially in tropical and subtrupical regions. They are called \"stink bugs\" because they release a strong odour when they feel threatened. The bugs feed by piercing the crop with their thin piercing mouth parts (stylets). The actual feeding puncture is not immediately visible. Both adults and juvenile stages of the bug feed on plants. They prefer to feed on the delicate parts of the plant (growing shoot, fruit, flower). When it hatches, the juvenile stage of the bug stays close to the eggs. The adults can fly and move around a lot. They are usually green and thus hard to recognize in plants. The colour of the bug changes as they grow, becoming greener with each stage. Usually they move to higher parts of the plants early in the morning.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nRemove leaf litter.\\nControl the weed growth in your field.\\nPlant crops earlier and with larger row width.\\nPlant early maturing trap crops, like leguminous and cruciferous plants as these crops attract the bug.\\nPlough the trap crop under before the southern green stink bugs become adults and move to the main crop.'},\n",

They also burrow into the seeds, often destroying the growing tissues and preventing germination. If they develop at all, there is clear damage from the maggots’ feeding visible on the young leaves. Rot of tissues can ensue. Seedlings may develop into withered, stunted, deformed plants which give few seeds with low quality and consequently low yields. If soils are wet and if there are prolonged periods of cool weather and high humidity, the damage can be significant.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDue to its underground life, seedcorn maggots do not appear to have a great number of natural enemies. However, predation by ground beetles, spiders and birds on adults does occur. The larvae can be affected by fungus diseases. However, predators as well as fungal diseases do not provide sufficient control. The flies are naturally attracted to bright colors, so they can be trapped in bright buckets with soapy water.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of both preventive measures along with biological treatments if available. Seeds can be treated with an insecticide to ward off the maggot. Pesticides can be used, but be aware of the restrictions in your country. Soil-applied insecticides can also be used.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the maggots of the flies Delia platura and D. antiqua. The adults resemble house flies in color, but they are smaller and more slender. They overwinter in soil close to old roots and plant debris. Adults emerge in spring as early as seeds are being planted. Females lay their eggs in moist soils that contain large quantities of decaying material or manure. Yellowish-white, legless larvae hatch after about a week and then start to eat on decaying organic matter and on seedlings. Damage is greater in cool, wet weather conditions which favor the life cycle of the pest and its feeding activity. Warm and sunny weather in turn hinders the deposition of eggs and also makes plants grow faster and hardier.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant in dry soils with little organic content.\\nEnsure shallow planting during warm and sunny weather.\\nIf applying manure, wait some weeks before planting.\\nUse cover crops such as grasses.\\nHandle the seeds with care so that you don't injure them.\\nDestroy weeds in and around the fields.\\nA fine mesh net on your seedbed keeps the maggot flies away.\\nPlow and bury plant debris deep into the soil.\"},\n",

Typically, these lesions are found in higher numbers on the side of leaves facing the prevailing wind. Over time, these small lesions grow along the leaf blade and coalesce into sunken, oval-shaped or elongated, brown blotches, with tan to brown centers. Concentric zones may also develop in their center. In advanced stages, large necrotic areas form, which may girdle the leaf or seed stem, causing extensive blighting of the tissues.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nAqueous extracts of Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Datura stramonium ( jimsonweed) can be used for the biocontrol of Stemphylium leaf blight disease with an efficacy close to that of conventional fungicides. Under greenhouse conditions, the preventive or curative application of products based on Trichoderma harzianum and Stachybotrys chartarum results in the reduction of disease incidence and severity (around 70% in both cases).\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of both preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Solution of the active ingredients azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, boscalid + pyraclostrobin, chlorothalonil, iprodione, mancozeb and prochloraz are highly effective at reducing the growth in S. vesicarium. Treatments should be done when conditions are unfavorable for the fungus (cool and dry weather). In general, the effectiveness of the fungicides was enhanced with an alternation of products.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nStemphylium leaf blight is caused by the fungus Pleospora allii, formerly known as Stemphylium vesicarium, thereby the name of the disease. It survives on infected plant debris and resumes growth during favorable weather conditions in spring. It then produces spores that are spread to nearby plants by the wind. It normally invades dead and dying onion tissue, such as leaf tips, lesions caused by previous diseases, or simply injured tissue (from e.g. insects or hail). Long periods of warm wet conditions encourage disease development. Healthy leaves can thus also be attacked if the weather is warm (18 - 25 °C) and the leaf surface is wet for more than 24 hours. Infection usually remains restricted to leaves and does not affect the bulb.

The caterpillars consume large amounts of plant tissue and leave behind only the veins and stems. As a result, the plants are not able to photosynthesize properly, leading to reduced yields in crops. This means that the affected plants may produce fewer fruits than they would have if they had not been damaged by slug caterpillars.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo control the pest without chemicals, physically removing the caterpillars from affected plants is an option. This should be done using a pair of tweezers or a piece of tape, without touching them directly. Light traps can also be set up to trap and collect adult moths. About 5 light traps may be installed per hectare to effectively control the pest.\\nChemical Control\\nSelect the appropriate insecticide for your specific situation, following the label instructions carefully, and wearing protective clothing and gloves when applying it. Two active ingredients, Carbaryl and Dichlorvos, have been reported to have a good effect.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage caused by slug caterpillars is due to the caterpillar of moths belonging to the Limacodidae family. These caterpillars are known for their slug-like appearance and are a possible health problem to humans due to the painful sting of most species in the family. They are abundant in the tropics where they are present all year round. Slug caterpillars go through several stages in their life cycle. It starts with the eggs that are laid on the leaves of plants. Once hatched, the young caterpillars begin to feed on the leaves. During growth, they renew their skin several times and replace it with new one. Eventually, they form a cocoon around themselves and pupate. After a period of time, adult moths emerge from the cocoons and start the cycle again. These pests are of high ecological importance to palms because they can cause serious defoliation. It is important to identify and control these pests early in order to prevent damage to crops and ensure healthy growth of the plants.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nTo prevent a slug caterpillar infestation, it is important to keep your plants healthy and free from damage.\\nPurchase plant material only from clean, accredited suppliers, and preferably material that is certified.\\nEarly identification of the pest is crucial.\\nKeep an eye out for holes chewed in leaves, which may indicate the presence of the caterpillars.To be sure that the Slug Caterpillar Moth is actually occurring, the moths and caterpillar should also be detected in the field.\\nSuch leaf damage and defoliation of trees can be caused by other insect pests too.'},\n",

Diseased plants are are often be localized in low, wet areas of the field. As initial symptom, plants appear to wilt during the day or during dry and hot weather conditions. They often recover when temperatures cool down or after the sun sets. The affected plants have a stunted growth. Over time, the older leaves show chlorosis, and may drop, occasionally leading to the death of the plant. A characteristic symptom on the roots is the development of small knot-like galls. As the disease progresses, club-shaped galls develop on primary and lateral roots. Not all plants show above ground symptoms, so in some cases the disease can only be detected by checking the roots. Seeds are not affected by the fungus.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe only organic control available is to raise the pH of the soil to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into the soil in the fall (small gardeners and farmers). The fungus does not grow very well at higher pH. Simple and affordable soil test kits are available to check pH often.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. In the case of clubroot there is no possibility of cure once the infection has established itself. Preventive measures are thus very important. Seedbeds can be fumigated with metham-sodium, di-trapex, or dazomet 2 to 3 weeks before planting. Soil treatments are recommended before planting or during planting if transplants are used. Chlorinating irrigation water also significantly reduces clubroot incidence.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused by the fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which can survive as resting spores in the soil for up to 20 years. It is an obligate parasite, which means that it cannot grow and multiply without a living host such as canola or other susceptible crops and weeds. It is spread by infested plant material, contaminated irrigation water, equipment and tools. In spring, these spores become mobile and infect plants through root hairs or via injuries caused by underground animals or during field work (for example transplanting). Infected tissues grow unnaturally and then produce a new batch of spores. These spores complete the life cycle of the fungus as they spread to healthy surrounding plants or are released to the soil through rotting plant tissue. Acid soils (pH below 6.5), high moisture and a soil temperature about 18-25°C favor the growth of the fungus. The disease can lead to heavy or complete yield losses if the infection occurs early and the conditions are favorable to the fungus.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nBe careful to use healthy planting material or planting material from a certified source.\\nUse seeds instead of transplants to avoid the disease.\\nUse tolerant or resistant varieties, if available for a particular crop.\\nDo not cultivate crops of the Brassica family in fields with a history of clubroot.\\nCrop rotation with non-host crops for at least 7 years is recommended.\\nCheck the pH-level of the soil regularly when nitrogen fertilizers are used.\\nEnhance the amount of lime in order to raise the pH in the soil and curtail the disease.\\nEnsure the irrigation water is pathogen-free and do not overwater.\\nSelect well-drained planting sites or ensure good drainage.\\nCheck your plants or fields regularly for any sign of the disease.\\nDisinfect your equipment and tools before operation and wash your hands frequently.'},\n",

Older leaves are infected first and then the disease slowly moves up towards young leaves. On the upper leaf surface, small, diffuse, pale green or yellowish spots with indefinite margins appear. On the underside, olive green to grayish purple and velvety patches develop below the leaf spots. These are composed of spore-producing structures and spore masses (conidia). Over time, as the spots enlarge, the color of the infected leaf changes from yellowish (chlorosis) to brown (necrosis) and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop prematurely, leading to defoliation in severe cases. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the blossoms or fruits with various symptoms. The blossoms may turn black and will be killed before fruit set. Green and ripe fruits will develop smooth black irregular area on the stem end. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSeed treatment with hot water (25 minutes at 122 °F or 50 °C) is recommended to avoid the pathogen on seeds. The fungi Acremonium strictum, Dicyma pulvinata, Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride and Trichothecium roseum are antagonistic to M. fulva and could be used to reduce its spread. In greenhouse trials the growth of M. fulva on tomatoes was inhibited by A. strictum, Trichoderma viride strain 3 and T. roseum by 53, 66 and 84% respectively. In small arms, apple-cider, garlic or milk sprays and vinegar mix can be used to treat the mold.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Applications should be made prior to infection when environmental conditions are optimal for the development of the disease. Recommended compounds in field use are chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb and copper formulations. For greenhouses, difenoconazole, mandipropamid, cymoxanil, famoxadone and cyprodinil are recommended.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Mycovellosiella fulva, whose spores can survive without a host for 6 months to a year at room temperature (non-obligate). Prolonged leaf moisture and humidities above 85% favor the germination of spores. The temperature must be between 4° to 34 °C for spores to germinate, with an optimum temperature at 24-26°C. Dry conditions and the absence of free water on leaves impair germination. The symptoms usually start to appear 10 days after inoculation with the development of spots on both sides of the leaf blade. On the underside, a large number of spore-producing structures are formed and these spores are easily spread from plant to plant by the wind and water splashing, but also on tools, clothing of workers and insects.

They look like raised, conic spots with a somewhat clearer center (volcano-like shape). A yellow halo can be observed around the spot where they feed. At heavy infestations, leaves will wilt, fall prematurely and defoliation will ensue. Infested twigs will die back, something that may extend to larger branches in cases of severe infestations. Fruits may be encrusted by numerous scales and grow deformed, eventually drying out and falling off the tree. Young trees may be severely stunted, or even killed if several of the branches die back. Red scale also excretes honeydew and may lead to the formation of sooty mold on leaves and fruits.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNatural enemies of Aonidiella aurantii include the parasitic wasps Aphytis melinus and Comperiella bifasciata and the predatory mite Hemisarcoptes malus which attack the crawlers. Control of ants is key for biological control of red scale, as those protect scales from natural enemies. Organically approved petroleum oil spray can also be used to rid leaves and fruits from scales. After harvest use high-pressure washing to get rid of scales on your fruits.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological control, if available. Sprays with narrow range oil have minimum disruption to natural enemies and are best applied in mid-summer. Corrective chemical spray should be applied when more than 25% of fruits are infested. Use insecticides selectively on parts of the orchard where the number of scales exceeds this threshold. Avoid use of broad-spectrum insecticides that could disturb beneficial insects.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the red scale, Aonidiella aurantii. It is a major pest of citrus worldwide, common in the tropics. They survive after harvest on wood and leaves, infesting new growth in the next growing season. In their mobile phase, females are highly attracted by light in their search for a feeding spot. They do not lay eggs but gives birth to very active crawlers. Once settled on the upper side of a leave or on depressions on young fruits, they become immobile. After a short phase in which they are covered by a cottony substance, they eventually acquire their circular flattened form and their characteristic reddish-brown color. Their life cycle is closely correlated to temperature and the health of the tree. Thus, greatest damage usually occurs at the end of summer, when trees may suffer from moisture stress.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse pheromone traps to attract females and assess the severity of the infestation.\\nMonitor your orchard regularly for signs of scales and scrape them off if in low numbers.\\nRemove heavily-infested twigs or branches.\\nPrune trees adequately to improve aeration within the canopy, creating unfavorable conditions for scales.\\nPlace traps or obstacles to catch or hinder ants that cater for the scales.\\nDo not use broad-spectrum insecticides that could affect beneficial insects.\\nMinimize dust coating of leaves and fruits by watering roads and washing trees.'},\n",

Later, the infected areas become necrotic, turn gray and shrink, often tearing away from the healthy leaf tissue and falling off. These lesions often have yellow margins. The large, irregular holes give the leaf a ragged appearance. On some resistant varieties, the lesions are smaller and lack yellow margins. Infected fruits show small, almost circular spots that are usually superficial. When the affected tissues die, they turn white and crack open, letting opportunistic fungi and bacteria colonize and rot the whole fruit. Infection of young fruit may cause extensive fruit drop.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nInfected seeding material can be treated with garlic solutions and hot water (50°C) for 30 minutes. In greenhouses, the occurrence of angular leaf spot can be suppressed by controlling night-time humidity (to 80-90%) with dehumidifiers. The biological control agent Pentaphage effectively decimates P. syringae. Organic copper fungicides can slow down the spreading of the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Pesticides containing copper hydroxide can be applied. The treatment is most effective when the temperature is above 24 °C and the foliage is wet. Spraying on a hot day when the foliage is dry can injure the plants. Weekly spraying may be necessary to achieve control of the disease.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae, which can infect all cucurbit crops. It survives in infected seeds or in plant debris in the soil for periods of over 2 years. When humidity is high, a drop of clear to white sticky bacterial ooze forms on the infection sites. These bacteria are moved from plant to plant on the hands and tools of workers, by insects, or by splashing water or wind. Eventually, the bacteria enter the plant via the pores present on the leaf surface (stomata). When fruit are infected, the bacteria moves deep into the flesh and infects the seeds.

Fruit are most susceptible to damage from shortly after petal fall until they are about 3.7 cm in diameter. The risk of attack by thrips is higher on the fruits located on the outside of the canopy, where they are also susceptible to wind damage and sunburn. The texture of the pulp and the characteristics of the juice may be unaffected, but the fruits may be unmarketable.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe predatory mite Euseius tularensis, spiders, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs attack citrus thrips. E. tularensis provide control of the pest and serve as an \"indicator\" species, that is, it gives an idea of the general level of natural enemies present in an orchard. Make sure not to disrupt these predatory species by use of broad-scale pesticides. Sprays of formulations of spinosad with an organically approved oil, kaolin or Sabadilla alkaloids applied with molasses or sugar bait are usually recommended in organically managed orchards.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Although the foliage can be attacked, normally healthy trees can withstand the damage caused by low populations of thrips. Frequent pesticide applications is not recommended in non-bearing trees as this can lead to the development of resistance, making control of thrips more difficult in later years. Formulations containing abamectin, spinetoram, cyfluthrin and abamectin can be used against citrus thrips.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the citrus thrip, Scirtothrips citri. Adults are small, orange-yellow with fringed wings. During spring and summer, females lay about 250 eggs in new leaf tissue, young fruit, or green twigs. In fall, overwintering eggs are laid mostly in the last growth flush of the season. These eggs will hatch in the next spring about the time of the new growth in the trees. Young larvae are very small, whereas older ones are about the size of adults, spindle-shaped, and wingless. Last larval stages (pupa) thrips do not feed and complete their development on the ground or in the crevices of trees. When adults emerge, they move actively around the tree foliage. Citrus thrips do not develop below 14°C and they can produce 8 to 12 generations during the year if the weather is favorable.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resistant varieties, if available.\\nMonitor the orchard regularly for symptoms of the pest.\\nUse sticky traps over a large area for mass-catching.\\nMake sure not to disrupt the predatory species by the use of broad-scale pesticides.\\nAvoid planting near alternative hosts and control weeds in and around the field.\\nKeep plants well irrigated, and avoid excessive applications of nitrogen fertilizer.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Fruit Tree Leafroller\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe young larvae feed initially on blossoms and flower buds, boring holes and working their way into the internal tissues. Later forms attacks basically all plant parts from a shelter that they make rolling and spinning the two margins of a leaf together with silken threads. Attacked leaves have a ragged appearance and defoliation may occur in severe cases. Fruits may show shallow cavities close to the skin and those that do not drop prematurely may have bronze-colored scars with roughened, net-like surfaces. Fruit deformation is common, and make them unmarketable. In severe infestation, trees may be entirely covered with silken threads, as can be the ground below them. Plants under the trees may also be attacked as larvae drop to the ground and feed on them.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nA number of general predators, such as lacewing, beetles and ladybirds may feed on the larvae of the fruit tree leafroller. Parasitoid wasps of the genus Trichogramma lay eggs on the eggs of the leafroller and prey on the small larvae as they grow. These natural enemies can help to keep the populations at low levels, but occasionally outbreaks may occur. Applications of narrow range oil, or solutions based on Bacillus thuringiensis or spinosad are organically acceptable.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider integrated pest management with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Products containing the active ingredients methoxyfenozide, chorpyrifos, chlorantraniliprole or spinetoram can help to reduce populations. The latter is also toxic to bees. Note that the type of crop would determine the exact treatment.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the larvae of the moth Archips argyrospila, commonly known as fruit-tree leafroller moth. Adults have a brownish, hairy body with forewings that are about 10 mm in length and have a quadrilateral aspect. The color consists in a combination of reddish brown, dark brown and tan. Back wings are uniformly grayish, with slightly brownish extremities and fringed margins. Females are generally lighter in color than males. They lay eggs in masses on the twigs of the host and cover them with a protective coat. While young larvae bore holes in buds, later forms roll or tie leaves together or to fruits to build a shelter. From there, they emerge to feed on leaves, flowers, buds, or sometimes fruits of the host. The larvae attack a wide range of hosts, among others apple and pear trees, citrus and stone fruits. They have one generation per year.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the orchards for signs of the pest.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Bacterial Stalk Rot of Maize\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe bacterial stalk rot of maize is characterized by the discoloration of leaves, leaf sheath and the nodes of the stalk. The disease then develops rapidly along the stalk and spreads up to other leaves. As the tissues decay, a foul odor can be detected and the top of the plant can be very easily removed from the rest of the plant. The stalk rots completely and occasionally the top collapses. A longitudinal cut of the stalk reveals internal discoloration and soft slimy rot that is more concentrated at the nodes. Because the bacteria usually do not spread from plant to plant, diseased plants are quite often found scattered throughout the field. However, there are reports of plant-to-plant transmission by some insect vectors. The disease is observed in maize when intermittent heavy rains are followed by high temperature and humid conditions.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere are no biological control options available for E. chrysanthemi at the moment. Please notify us if you know of any.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chlorination of irrigation water or soil drenching with bleaching powder (33% chlorin @ 10 kg/ha) at pre flowering stage is recommended. Formulations containing copper oxychloride can also be effectively applied against the disease. Finally, the addition of 80 kg/ha of MOP in two splits reduces the severity of the symptoms.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi, which overwinters only in stalk residues above the soil surface, but is unable to survive for longer than a year there. There is no evidence that the bacterium is transmitted via seeds. Disease is favored by temperatures of 32-35°C and high relative humidity. Frequent rainfall and overhead irrigation with sprinklers causes prolonged leaf wetness and the accumulation of water in the whorl. As this water heats, it can damage the plant tissues, providing openings through which infection can take place. Plants subjected to high temperatures or flooding may develop the symptoms first around the base of the plant. Irrigation water is believed to be the primary inoculum source. Although it may spread along the plant to infect additional nodes, the bacteria do not usually spread to neighboring plants unless vectored by an insect.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlan a good drainage system to avoid flooding.\\nPlant resilient varieties, if available in your area.\\nMonitor the field regularly for symptoms of the disease.\\nAvoid excess nitrogen and always split the applications.\\nAmend with high doses of phosphorus and potassium to decrease the incidence of the disease.\\nAvoid irrigation during very hot periods of the day where water can collect in the plant whorl.\\nIn endemic areas, farmers are advised to incorporate green manure in soil before sowing of maize.\\nIncorporate debris in the soil after harvest to break the cycle.'},\n",

Leaves of infested canes dry up at the tip, with an unhealthy pale green colour. The leaves later turn yellow with a continued infestation. The loss of sap also leads to the non-opening of the leaves, which ultimately turn yellow and dry up. Eventually, the cane dries up and appears brownish-red when slit opens. Infested canes become shriveled and the entire cane is covered with the pest forming encrustation on the stem in case of severe infestation. Due to its sedentary habits and minute size, the insect escapes the notice of the cane grower. Its existence is only revealed after severe damage has occurred.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDip the setts in 1% fish oil rosin soap emulsion. Spray white oils (foliage and stalks), which show some effectiveness against young scales. Release Chilocorus nigritus or Pharascymnus horni egg card @ 5CC/AC. Introduce hymenopteran parasitoids such as Anabrotepis mayurai, Cheiloneurus sp. and predatory mites such as Saniosulus nudus and Tyrophagus putrescentiae, which can feed on the insect scale.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Soak setts in 0.1% of malathion solution before planting. Spray dimethoate @ 2ml/l or monocrotophos @ 1.6m/l after detrashing. Treat setts with acephate 75 SP @ 1g/l twice after detrashing, just before the initial appearance of the pest.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the crawler's scales. Females are ovoviviparous - which means that the young ones are produced by eggs that are hatched within the body of the female. Upon hatching, the crawlers (young immature scales) wander about in search of a feeding site. They attach their needle-like mouthparts, extract the plant sap and do not move again. The infestation begins with the formation of the internodes and continues to increase as the cane plant grows. Plant sap is sucked by crawlers. In severe infestation, the leaf sheath, lamina, and midrib are also infested.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse resistant varieties such as CO 439, CO 443, CO 453, CO 671, CO 691 and CO 692.\\nCultivate the setts that are free from scale insects.\\nUse clean planting materials to delay scale population build-up.\\nKeep fields and bunds free from weeds.\\nDrain stagnant water from fields.\\nMonitor your field regularly for signs of infestation.\\nUproot and burn heavily infested sugarcane plants.\\nConsider crop-rotation with a non-host crop (e.g.\\nwheat).\\nDetrash the crop at the 150th and 210th day of planting.\\nAvoid repeated ratoons.\"},\n",

Neem oil can also keep the pest under control.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. No pesticides are registered specifically against grass blue butterfly. Most products targeting other species of Lepidoptera will also control this pest. Profenofos was suggested to control the E. cnejus effectively.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused primarily by the larva of Euchrysops cnejus. The adult male is light purple whilst the female is rather heavily black-dusted with its wing bases pale shining blue. Females can lay from 60 to 200 eggs in its lifetime and place them singly on shoots, flower buds or leaves. The larva is typically stout, flat pale green or yellow, measuring about 13 mm with a red line and short black hairs on its bodies. They are often attended by black ants. Due to their colouring and their feeding spots, the caterpillars are hard to find despite being diurnal (active during the daytime). The larvae feed on flowers and young pods, especially in pulse crops and bore into them. Pupation occurs on the leaves.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant your crop with enough spacing and avoid early or late sowing.\\nRake the soil regularly during the period of infestation to kill larvae and pupae.\\nMonitor your field for signs of the pest.\\nCollect and destroy the larvae, pupae and adults.'},\n",

Freshly sown seeds can be blown out of the soil during strong wind gusts. Newly emerged seedlings are prone to damage by sand corns (sandblasting). In older plants, leaves tend to wilt with continuous wind stress, eventually becoming dry and brittle. Foliage can also show signs of interveinal necrosis and in severe cases be shredded and tattered. Plants grow stunted if continually exposed to wind stress. Later in the season, loss of flower, fruit bruising and wounding are added to the list of symptoms. Bruised fruits with pimple-like lesions are not marketable. Yield losses because of poor flower stand and reduced fruit quality may be expected.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere is no biological control solutions against wind damage. Preventive measures, for example in the form of windbreaks, will help to avoid the damage.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatment if available. It is important to first evaluate the extent of the damage and determine if the crop can be saved. Potential treatments will also depend on the growth stage of the plant. In severe cases, treatments should be focused on the prevention of fungal and bacterial diseases, for example with the clear-cutting of the damaged plant parts and the application of fungicidal and antibacterial products.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by wind, and are of particular concern in areas with strong, continuous wind and in fields with no windbreaks. The damage may be caused either by soil particles lifted into suspension or by the movement of branches. Wind speed, period of exposure and the growth stage of the plant will determine the severity of the symptoms. Young cucumber plants grown on sandy soil are particularly susceptible to sand abrasion and injury. The movements of branches cause wounds on leaf and fruit surfaces. Bacteria and fungi may colonized the damaged tissues and lead to rot.

Eventually, the whole plant may wilt. Black soft rot can also develop on young fruits, usually at the blossom end. A close inspection will reveal silvery, hair-like growth on all infected tissues. In seedlings, symptoms may be confused with Phytophthora blight.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThere is no biological treatment available for this disease. In Benin, the bacterium Bacillus subtilis has been tested positively in some crops for its antagonist effect against Choanephora cucurbitarum. However, no test on peppers has been carried out.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Prevention is the key as there are no fungicides labeled for this disease. Control using fungicides might help to restrict the development of symptoms but is often impractical because plants are continuously flowering and thus susceptible to the pathogen.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by Choanephora cucurbitarum, an opportunistic fungus that mainly attacks tissues that have been damaged by insects or mechanical means during fieldwork. Its spores are generally spread via wind, splashing water, and through clothes when in contact with tools and cultivation equipment. Outbreaks of the disease usually occur during prolonged rainy periods, high humidity and high temperatures.

       "  'data': 'Potato Leafroll Virus\\n\\nSymptoms\\nVisible symptoms vary according to plant variety, environmental conditions and type of infection. Primary infection, which is caused by aphids, is visible mostly on younger leaves. The margins start to roll upwards and become dry, pale or develop interveinal chlorosis. In plants grown from a contaminated tuber (secondary infection), older leaves are upturned, stiff and brittle with a purple or red underside, while younger ones are upright and pale green or chlorotic. The plants growth is stunted and the stalks are stiff and point upwards. High infection levels reduce tuber yield and marketability.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDirect treatment of the virus is not possible, but reducing aphid population by means of predators or parasitoids is a helpful preventive measure. Ladybirds, soldier beetles, lacewings, and some types of midges and flies eat adults aphids and larvae. Parasitic wasps could also be used.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chemical treatment of viral diseases is not possible. However, the aphid population can be controlled to some degree. Apply insecticides in the early phases of crop growth for example.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nInitial transmission occurs when plants get infested and fed upon by virus-carrying aphids during the growing season. Secondary infection takes place when contaminated tubers are planted, and potato plants grow from them. Aphids transmit the infection to other healthy plants. The virus is persistent for the life of the aphid, so the potential of infection is high. To transmit the virus, the insects need to feed on the plant for at least 2 hours. Humid soil promotes the risk of infection.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse seed tubers from healthy plants or acquire certified seeds.\\nPlant resilient varieties if available.\\nMonitor the field, pick and destroy diseased plants.\\nDestroy weeds and volunteer plants that can host the virus and feed the aphids.'},\n",

The larvae are present in the mines and feed on the mesophyll. Leaves become impaired and photosynthesis is unable to take place. Plants become defoliated and eventually die off.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nCrop management practices and landscape structure can affect insect communities and the ecosystem services provided by natural enemies, enhancing their diversity and abundance. Ecologically complex coffee systems are associated with a higher biodiversity of parasitoid wasps, ants, and other predators. However, no significant attempt was made to use these natural enemies as biological control. Pheromones can be used to manipulate or disrupt the natural behaviours of insects to reduce population levels.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach along with preventive measures and available biological treatments. Currently, coffee growers use neurotoxic insecticides, such as organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and diamides. However, chemical controls are insufficient and can lose their effectiveness because their use can lead to pest resistance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of Coffee Leaf Miner (CLM), which only feeds on coffee leaves. The adults mate at night and females lay eggs on the upper surface of coffee leaves. Pre oviposition time is 3.6 days at 20°C. On average, each egg is about 0.3 mm and they are difficult to see with the naked eye. On hatching, the larvae leave the lower side of the eggs that are in contact with the upper leaf epidermis and get into the leaves. The larvae are transparent and reach 3.5 mm in length. The larvae feed on the mesophyll of the leaves and create mines in the leaves. The mines cause necrosis, decreasing the photosynthetic leaf surface. This leads to a lower photosynthetic rate of the plants and a subsequent depletion of the plant. The larval phase has four instars. Larvae leave the mines and weave a silk X-shaped cocoon, usually in the axial region of the leaf, forming the pupae. Usually, more pupae are found in the lower side of the plant where dead leaves accumulate. From pupae, adults emerge with an average body length of 2 mm and a wing span of 6.5 mm. They have white hair scales with long antennae that reach the end of the abdomen and are brownish-white and frilled wings. On the emergence of the adults from the pupae, they mate and lay eggs, restarting the cycle. The incidence of the pest is favoured by dry seasons and high temperatures.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nIdeally, the first generation of CLM should be controlled effectively to prevent a growing population throughout the year.\\nPractice regular monitoring using the Delta trap to control the insect population.'},\n",

The top rot phase is the most serious stage where the malformation and twisting of leaves are pronounced. Red specks are dissolved and the whole base of the spindle gets rotten and dried up. In severe infections, buds sprout and the apical parts of the stalks are seriously damaged. The third stage known as the knife cut stage shows transverse cuts in the rind of the stalk or stem. When leaves are stripped off, large conspicuous chlorotic patches are seen on stalks.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIf available, use resistant or moderately resistant varieties for planting.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach along with preventive measures and available biological treatments.

The pathogens can be spread primarily by air currents and airborne spores colonize the leaves, flowers and stems of plants through any injury by insects, borers or natural growth cracks. Secondary infection is through the infected setts, irrigation water, splashed rains and soils. Infection usually occurs through the spindle along the edge of a partially expanded leaf. The spores that enter the spindle germinate and grow into the internal tissue of the spindle leaf. This results in the deformation and shortening of the leaves. The spread of spores depends on various environmental conditions and is more pronounced in the dry season followed by the humid season.

This interveinal chlorosis gradually forms a yellow to brown mosaic pattern that should not be mixed up with virus infections. On the lower leaf side, the water-soaked lesions that appear just beneath these spots slowly acquire a light-gray, velvety and fuzzy appearance during cool temperature and high, prolonged humidity. As the fungus extracts nutrients from the plant, it can cause the dwarfing or killing of young shoots, flowers or fruits and lead to stunted growth and poor yields. In contrast to powdery mildew, the coating appear exclusively on the underside of leaves and its growth is limited by the main veins. Moreover, it cannot be removed easily.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nCommercial biological treatments for fighting downy mildew are available.

Commonly used post-infection fungicides include mefenoxam, strobilurins, fluopicolide, famoxadone+cymoxanil, cyazofamid, and zoxamide. Resistance to some of these products has been observed.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by a fungus of the group of the water molds, Pseudoperonospora cubensis. It is an obligate parasite that requires living green plant tissue to survive. It is particularly destructive in shaded areas with cool, wet and humid conditions (heavy dews, fogs, precipitations) and temperatures around 15-23°C. The fungus overwinters in infected plant debris or shoots or on alternative hosts (crops and weeds). Wind, air currents and rain splashes spread the spores to healthy plant tissues during favorable conditions. Once they land on a susceptible host, the spores germinate and produce structures that enter the plant tissues through natural pores on the underside of leaves. There it starts to spread, eventually outgrowing the internal tissues and forming the characteristic mildew coating outside. There, spores are produced that will spread the disease even further.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nEnsure that seeds and transplants are free from disease.\\nPlant cucurbit crops early in the season.\\nProvide good spacing between plants.\\nPlant in sites well exposed to the sun and choose right orientation.\\nChose resistant varieties, if available.\\nKeep your plant dry, for example through proper ventilation.\\nWater in during the mornings rather than in the evenings.\\nMake sure soils are well drained and do not work in the fields when leaves are wet.\\nKeep the vines off the ground and properly tied.\\nEnsure a balanced fertilization for plant vigor.\\nFortifiers can be applied to strengthen the health of the plant.\\nControl weeds in and around the field.\\nRemove plant residues from the field.\\nWash tools and equipment and ensure field workers wash their hands before moving from one field to the other.\\nAvoid distribution of infected soil and plant material from field to field.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Blue Mould of Tobacco\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSingle or groups of yellow spots appear on the older, shaded leaves. Additionally, dense gray mould can appear on the underside of the leaf lesions. The spots can spread and the leaves eventually die. Finally, the plant grows smaller than it should. Sometimes, the fungus can spread throughout the stem. This can cause the plant to stop growing and wilt at any age. Brown streaks can be found inside these stems. A sign in the nursery for the disease being present are patches of dead or dying seedlings. At first, the top of the leaves may look normal, but after a day or two, yellow spots develop. Seedlings will start to die and turn light brown.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nCurrently, there are no biological products available to control blue mould disease.\\nChemical Control\\nMost of the time the control of blue mould chemically is necessary in temperate and subtropical tobacco areas. Dithiocarbamates or systemic products with residual activity are used. Use pesticides regulated for your area. Always follow the label for the correct application. Inform yourself on the resistance of the pathogen to the pesticide of your choice. Chemical sprays are not effective against systemic infection.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is created by a plant pathogen called Peronospora hyoscyami which causes Blue Mould. It is a fungal disease that affects tobacco plants. It is spread through wind-blown spores and infected transplants. Once it is present, it grows by infecting the plant tissue. Under optimal conditions, the fungus produces the next generation of spores within 7-10 days after initial infection. The fungus requires cool, wet, and cloudy weather to produce spores, and disease epidemics may become severe under these conditions. When the climate is sunny, hot, and dry, the fungus survives poorly.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPrevention measures are essential to avoid the infestation of blue mould in tobacco plants.\\nThe pathogen is highly dependent on a cool, humid environment to reproduce and infect the tobacco plant.\\nKeep the growing area as thoroughly drained.\\nAvoid overhead irrigation as it favours disease development.\\nDrip irrigation is a better option as it reduces the level of blue Mould in comparison with overhead irrigation.\\nMaintain appropriate plant spacing and limit nitrogen fertilisation that can cause excess growth.\\nSearch for resistant cultivars.'},\n",

These spots enlarge, turn light brown and form a slight depression. Small leaf veins within the spots darken, resulting in a netted appearance. Over time, concentric rings develop that are visible only on the upper leaf surface, giving the spot a target-like appearance. These circular spots can eventually affect the entire leaf and defoliation may occur. Circular, brown sunken lesions appear on infected fruits that later may be covered by a dark olive to black-colored powdery mat. Undetected fruit infection at harvest can result in later losses during storage or transportation of the harvest. Other parts of the plant are not directly affected.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nApplication of straw mulch immediately after planting effectively decreases the spreading of A. cucumerina spores from the soil onto the lower leaves.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Fungicides containing azoxystrobin, boscalid, chlorothalonil, copper hydroxide, mancozeb, maneb or potassium bicarbonate can control the disease. However, chlorothalonil containing products seem generally to be the most effective. The ingredients differ in their application schedule and frequency. Make sure to study the respective usage instructions beforehand.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms in melon and related cucurbit species are caused by the soil-borne fungus Alternaria cucumerina. It survives in crop debris in the soil or on weeds and other cucurbit hosts. Disease spread can occur with rain splashes, excessive irrigation, wind, cultivation, equipment and field workers. This disease is favored by warm temperatures and moisture from dew, rain or overhead irrigation. Infection can be initiated with two to eight hours of leaf wetness, but as the hours of leaf wetness increase infection level increases. The frequency of rain and the length of dew periods play a greater role in disease development than the volume of rain that falls.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUnfortunately, there are no resistant varieties available for this disease.\\nRegularly monitor the fields for symptoms of the disease.\\nRotate crops with species that exclude cucurbits for 1-2 years.\\nReduce crop stress to a minimum by e.g.\\nproviding a balanced nutrition.\\nMaintain a high standard of hygiene in tools and equipments.\\nUse drip irrigation instead of overhead sprinklers if possible.\\nDo not work in plants when wet.\\nRemove plant debris at the end of the season.\\nDestroy the debris by deep burying them in the fields or simply burning at a distance.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Red Pumpkin Beetle\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe adult insects feed voraciously on the leaves, flowers and fruits. The beetle produces large holes in the plant tissues (between the veins), causing growth retardation and eventually death of the plant. The damage done to young seedlings is often devastating as it delays crop maturity. If flowers are affected, it will result in reduced fruit setting. The grubs of this pest remain in the soil and feed on roots and underground stem of the plants, which causes rotting and withering of the stems and roots. Adults feeding on seedlings may retard the development and even lead to death, thus resulting in bare patches in the field. Beetles sometimes aggregate and gnaw on the foliage of older plants. Flower parts can also suffer some damage, resulting in reduced fruit setting. Lower parts of young fruits show scars caused by adult feeding, enabling the invasion by rot causing micro-organisms.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNatural enemies attack the beetle, including members of the tachinid family and the reduviid Rhynocoris fuscipes. Mix half a cup of wood ash and half a cup of lime in 4 litres of water, and leave to stand for a few hours. Strain and test this mixture on a few infested plants before applying on your field. Apply the mixture as a foliar spray on your crop. Alternatively, you can use plant-derived products such as neem (NSKE 5%), derris or pyrethrum (add soap with it) @ 7-day interval. Apply Triciderma Trichoderma as seed and nursery treatment and Pseudomonas fluorescens as seed, nursery treatment and soil application. Use trap crops that were treated with a strong insecticidal spray to attract and kill the adult beetles.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Deltamethrin @ 250 ml/acre can be used when 1 adult/10 plants is detected in the nursery. Synthetic pyrethroids are likely to be effective but are at the same time harmful to natural enemies. Use of trap crops that were treated with a strong insecticidal spray can attract and kill the adult beetles. Spray fenitrothion as soon as the pest is detected and repeat the process at 15 days interval.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamage is caused by the grub as well as the adult beetle of Aulacophora foveicollis, which feed on the leaves, flowers and fruits. Full-grown larvae are usually creamy white and the size of a human fingernail. Eggs are usually oval, yellow and are laid singly or in clusters of 10 in moist soil at the depth of a human finger near the base of the plant. Adults are orange-red and the same size as a housefly. The larvae hatch after 1 or 2 weeks and attack the plant and its roots before going into the soil to pupate. Pupation takes place in an earthen cocoon from 7 to 17 days. Optimal environmental conditions for pupation are met when the temperature is 27-28°C.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse fast-growing varieties, and plant trap crops.\\nAvoid planting new crops next to the already infested ones.\\nPlant extra seeds to compensate or replace heavily infested plants.\\nCover seedlings with polythene bags to protect them against beetle damage.\\nEnsure good conditions for healthy plant growth such as adequate nutrients, manures and watering using furrow irrigation.\\nMonitor fields once a week for feeding damage and use yellow sticky traps.\\nKeep your field free of alternate host weeds.\\nCollect and burn or bury the debris.\\nHandpick beetles early in the morning when they are still sluggish.\\nPlough deeply during summer to disturb and expose the hibernating stage.\\nConserve natural predators and parasitoids.'},\n",

Natural pyrethrum (pyrethrin) and synthetic pyrethrum (pyrethroids) are effective in controlling lace bug of olive. Potassium salts of fatty acids, also knows as soap salts, are reported to control the insect. Some organophosphates can be used in a production level.

It is common to spot different stages of the insect clustered on the down side of the damages leaves. Eggs that have over-wintered on the tree usually begin to hatch out in spring or late winter. Adults can fly short distances. Feeding of the immature and adult insects causes yellow mottling to the leaves surface. The olive lace bug can have numerous generations per year depending on the climate. New infestations can occur regularly throughout the growing season.

Feeding takes place along the leaf axis and large patches of tissue are removed, including the slightly harder veins. The damage is similar to that caused by the rice skipper and the green semilooper, so it is essential to detect the caterpillar to differentiate these species. The larvae can also feed on a large series of alternate hosts that may help to complete their life cycle and support their continuous development in the field.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nNatural enemies of the greenhorned caterpillar include chalcid wasps (Trichogramma species) and two species of tachinid flies that parasitize the larvae. Some species of vespid wasps prey on the larvae. Since this pest usually occurs in low number and the pressure from beneficial insects is high, the plant can recover from the feeding damage by itself.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of both preventive measures and biological treatments if available. There are no chemical control measures that specifically target Melantis leda ismene. Broad-scale insecticides can kill the pest, but also their natural enemies. Accordingly, it is only recommended to spray these kinds of insecticides in very severe infestation cases.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms on leaves are usually caused by the caterpillars of the greenhorned caterpillar Melanitis leda, but other species of the genus Mycalesis can be involved. These insects are found in all rice environments and they are most common in rainfed areas. Adults are large golden brown butterflies with characteristic eyespots on the wings. Notably, they are not attracted to light traps. Females lay shiny, pearl-like eggs individually in rows on rice leaves. The larvae blend easily with the rice foliage because of their body's yellow green color, which is also covered by small and yellow bead-like hairs. They have two prominent brown horns on their head that give them their common name. They feed on alternate hosts that may also support their continuous development in the field. Pupation occurs on the leaves. Greenhorned caterpillars are minor pests of rice.

They eventually erupt, releasing their content, and forming a typical lesion with a light brown or gray center and oily, water-soaked brownish margin. Occasionally, the center of old cankers fall out, leaving behind a shot-hole effect. Similar symptoms can appear on fruits and twigs, where the cankers can reach a sizable dimension. The center of the lesion becomes characteristically raised, scabby or corky. Defoliation and premature fruit drop ensue and twigs may be killed by girdling of vascular tissues.

Preventive measures such as the clearing and destruction of fallen tree material are essential to minimize the effect of the disease. The control of citrus psyllids can also be a way to limit the damage. Copper-based fungicides or bactericides can provide a barrier against infection, but they will not treat an existing infection.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nCitrus canker is a serious and highly contagious disease of commercial varieties of citrus and relatives. It is caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas citri, which can survive for periods of over 10 months in old lesions on fruits, leaves, and stems. It enters the plant’s tissues through wounds or natural pores in the leaf surface and grows there systemically. The craters that form on leaves and other tissues contain bacteria, that are released when wet and spread by rain splash or overhead irrigation systems over short distances. Conditions that favor the disease are high humidity, hot (20 to 30 °C) and rainy weather conditions, ideally with strong winds.

It affects a variety of tree fruits, including peach, apricot, plum and cherry trees. It usually infects orchards that are neglected, old or stressed during the dormant phase. Fungal growth occurs in the bark during the winter when temperatures are above freezing but is stopped when trees resume growth in spring. Infection occurs mainly through mechanical injuries of the bark, cankers induced by other fungi and injuries to tissues by frost, sunburn or insect damage. High humidity (especially above 90%), rain and prolonged periods of leaf wetness increase the incidence and severity of the disease. Continuous wetting of the canker with irrigation water also promotes spore formation and liberation. However, low relative humidities impairs the life cycle of the fungus.

Entomopathogenic fungi, Bacillus thurigiensis, NPV and nematodes will infect larvae and adults. Botanical insecticides based on fresh Neem, lemongrass and ginger are also effective. Likewise, both eggs and young larvae can be controlled with the foliar application of 5% cottonseed oil. Pheromon traps can also be used to disrupt mating and inhibit or eliminate reproduction (up to 97 % efficiency).\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Insecticides are not recommended as they can kill beneficial insects and natural enemies of S. exigua, which in turn could actually lead to outbreaks of this pest. Moreover, this insect has shown a high capacity to develop resistance to many chemicals.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua. This insect occurs in warmer regions of Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe as well as in greenhouses in cooler climates. They infest various crops including cotton, beet and maize. Adult moths are of gray-brownish in color. Forewings are mottled brown and gray, with an irregular pattern and a light colored bean-shaped spot in their middle. Hindwings are gray or white in color, and with a dark line near the margin. Females lay eggs in clusters on the lower surface of leaves, covered by white or grayish hairs. The young larvae are greenish-brown and have dark longitudinal stripes on the back. Mature larva are green, with a marked yellow stripe on each flank and a wide yellowish-green band on their back.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant resistant species with harder leaf tissues.\\nAdjust the sowing time to avoid peak populations.\\nCheck your plants regularly for signs of the pest, especially in the late evening or early morning.\\nUse pheromone traps to monitor infestations.\\nRemove weeds and litter in and around the fields as they offer shelter and sites for breeding.\\nDig a deep trench and fill it with water to drown the caterpillars migrating from adjacent fields.\\nMake a reasonable use of broad-spectrum insecticides, as these can kill natural enemies.\\nPlow and harrow your field thoroughly to expose larvae and pupae to predators.'},\n",

This plant parasites the crop and extracts water and nutrients from the host plants, resulting in symptoms that mimic those of drought stress or nutrient deficiency: chlorosis, wilting of leaves and stunting of the plant. Pre-emergence symptoms are difficult to diagnose precisely because of their similarity to a general lack of nutrients. Once the emergence of the striga has taken place, it is usually too late to mitigate the damage, even if it is pooled out. This can lead to significant loss of yield.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nWitchweed is among the hardest parasitic plants to control, mainly due to the high amount of seeds it produces and their longevity. Affected plants should be uprooted and burned before they flower. The fungus Fusarium oxysporum may be used as a possible biocontrol of witchweed since it infects the early vascular tissues of the Striga plant and impairs its growth.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Herbicide against the witchweed are available are rather expensive and they may also directly affect the crop. The sprayer needs protection and the herbicides can kill useful plants. Herbicide priming of seeds has been used successfully in millet and sorghum with up to 80% decrease in infestation. It consists in soaking herbicide-resistant seeds in herbicide solutions before planting.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica, commonly known as purple witchweed or giant witchweed. It is particularly problematic in sub-Saharian Africa. They can be a serious problem to crop cereals, grasses and legumes including rice, maize, pearl millet, sorghum, sugarcane, and cowpea. Each plant can produce between 90,000 and 500,000 seeds, which can remain in the soil for periods of over 10 years. These seeds overwinter in the soil after their dispersal by wind, water, animal, or human machinery. When weather conditions are favorable and they are within a few centimeters of a host root, they will begin to germinate. Once in contact with the root, the witchweed produces a structure that attaches it to the host plant, thus establishing a parasitic relationship. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers also reduces the witchweed infection rate.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse fortifiers for a general strengthening of the crops.\\nApply manure generously at the beginning of the season.\\nSow plants of the genus Desmodium in the fields to prevent Striga from attaching to the roots of the crop.\\nPlanting napier grass around the field also helps pulling striga away of the main crops.\\nClean all tools, equipment, clothes and shoes carefully after working with infected plants.\\nFertilize the crop appropriately with nitrogen.\\nPlan a crop rotation of your crop with pulses.'},\n",

Under favorable conditions in spring, the fungus resumes growth and produces spores that become the primary source of inoculum. The pustules that form on leaves produce another type of spore that is spread by the wind (secondary source of inoculum). The fungus undergoes several cycles of reproduction on barley during the growing season. It affects cultivated and wild species of barley and oat, as well as a number of grasses and, notably, the perennial weed commonly known as buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica).

The attack of the terminal shoots results in a characteristic 'candle stick' symptom, referring to the necrotic aspect and shedding of shoot tips. Cassava plants aged 2-9 months are the most vulnerable to infestation. Severe mite attack can result in 20-80 % loss in tuber yield.

Inside the twig or branch, the female lays up to 60 eggs and as the larvae hatch, they start to bore up or down the sapwood. This is clearly visible when the bark is cut out and remove in the proximity of the entry holes. This feeding causes partial to complete girdling of the twig or branch, structurally weakening it as well as damaging vascular tissues. Larvae pupate inside the feeding galleries. In addition to olive trees, the beetles feed on oleander (Nerium oleander), occasionally ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and lilac (Syringa vulgaris).\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nThe beetle is attacked by a myriad of parasitoid wasps belonging to several families. The introduction of one of these species and the controlling effects may vary from year to year. The dominant natural enemy of olive bark beetles is the parasitoid wasp Cheiropachus quadrum, which can reduce pest populations by 30-50%. Natural enemies might be adversely affected by the application of insecticides based on pyrethroids.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. It is recommended to attract beetles by using pheromone traps based on ethylene. Application of insecticides based on pyrethroids like deltamethrin has been proven to significantly reduce beetle populations. Both methods used as part of an integrated approach also show good results.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the olive bark beetle, which has 2 to 4 generations per year, depending on the environmental conditions. Spring and early summer adults tend to lay eggs in pruned branches and olive wood stacked as firewood rather than on living trees. Larvae are xylophagous, meaning that they feed exclusively on wood. The insect is able to fly locally to new cultivation sites. It may also be carried over long distances when infested wood or living plant material are transported. Severe infestations may reduce the number of flowers and olive fruits, and the resulting damage can reach 70% of the crop.

An example of treatment could be: Spraying of mancozeb @ 2.5 g/l as soon as pustules appear and repeat at 10 days interval till flowering.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. The fungus overwinters in an alternate host (a species of Oxalis) and releases spores during the spring. The spores can be transported over great distances by winds and rain. They start the infection process when landing on the leaves. Secondary infection from plant to plant can also occur due to wind and rain. The development of the disease is favored by high relative humidities (nearly 100%), dew, rain and cool temperatures between 15 and 20°C (may vary depending on area). Hot, dry weather will in turn slow or hinder the development of the fungus and the incidence of the disease. It is more a problem in plants used for seed production and sweet corn.

       "  'data': 'Pistachio Seed Wasp\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms characterizing infestations with the pistachio seed wasp are the presence of an exit hole 1 to 2 mm in diameter on the fruit and the presence of a single larva per fruit. Kernels can be completely consumed. This pest originates from the Asiatic regions and is actually an indigenous pest of the inedible nuts of an ornamental pistachio (P. chinensis). It is now also widespread in the Mediterranean basin and attack pistachio orchards. The spread of this parasite poses a serious threat to the pistachio industry, since in severe cases, up to 70% of nuts can be destroyed.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSo far there is no biological control method against this pest. However, spray trials with Spinosad (a natural insecticide produced by a fungus) have shown good efficacy. Other trials with mineral products (clay, calcium carbonate) or other natural insecticides have shown overall lower efficacy levels than for Spinosad.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach that combines preventive measures with biological treatments, if available. The control strategy for this insect targets adults only. By the end of March, an emergence cage (e.g. a bottle) should be placed in the orchard. This trap contains a large number of contaminated pistachios (at least 50) from the previous year (with insect inside). This allows to monitor the actual emergence of the adults in the orchard. From the onset and for the whole duration of adult flight, sprays with insecticides every 7-10 days until the shell of the fruit hardens. Different active ingredients can be applied alternately: deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the wasp Eurytoma plotnikovi, which is a widespread and important pest of pistachio. Full grown larvae overwinters in mummified fruits left on trees or laying on soil litter. In spring, as soon as the temperature rises, adults emerge digging a hole on the hull and females search for unripe pistachio nuts to lay their eggs (usually a single egg per fruit). The newly hatched larvae feed on the pistachio kernel until all or almost all the seed embryo is consumed and then enter diapause, remaining inside the nut throughout the year. In spring, next year, the cycle starts again. Poor management practices of the infestations greatly influences the spread of E. plotnikovi in pistachio orchards.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCollect infected fruit on pistachio trees and soil litter and destroy them before the end of winter.\\nMonitor the presence of larvae in fruits.\\nPlow soils to bury infected fruits.\\nProtect fruit with mosquito nets.\\nUse old nuts as traps in the orchard to monitor the emergence of adults (sensitive period for treatments).'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Pink Bollworm\\n\\nSymptoms\\nPink bollworm causes failure of buds to open, boll shedding, lint damage and seed loss. In early summer, the first generation of larvae feeds in squares, which continue to grow and produce blooms. The infested blooms may have the petals tied together with larval silk threads. The second generation of larvae burrows into the bolls, through the lint, to feed on the seeds. The lint is cut and stained, resulting in severe quality loss. Damage is also evident on bolls as warts on the inside of the carpal walls. Additionally, the larvae do not hollow out the boll and leave frass on the outside as is often the case with a bollworm. Opportunistic organisms, such as boll rot fungi, will often infect bolls through entry or exit holes of the larvae.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSex pheromones extracted from Pectinophora gossypiella can be sprayed throughout infested fields. This greatly impairs the ability of male worms to find females and mate. Timely spraying with formulations of spinosad or Bacillus thuringiensis can also be effective. Pheromone traps (8 per acre) can be installed from 45 days after sowing or at the flowering stage and continue till the last picking or the end of the crop period. Change the lures of traps at every 21 days intervals.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. The foliar application of insecticide formulations containing chlorpyrifos, esfenvalerate or indoxacarb can be used to kill the moths of pink bollworm. Other active principles include gamma- and lambda-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin. No treatment is recommended against larvae as those are usually found inside plant tissues. Pheromone traps can be installed (8 per acre) from 45 days after sowing or at the flowering stage and continue them until the end of the crop period.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage to the cotton squares and bolls are caused by the larvae of the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella. Adults vary in color and size but are usually mottled gray to grayish-brown. They have an elongated slender appearance and brownish, oval-shaped wings with strongly fringed edges. Females lay singular eggs inside the bracts of squares or under the calyx of green bolls. Eggs normally hatch in 4 to 5 days and enter the squares or bolls soon after that. Young larvae have a dark-brown head and a white body with wide transverse pink bands on the back. As they age, they gradually acquire pinkish tones. They can be seen feeding inside the bolls when they are cracked open. Larvae will feed for about 10 to 14 days before pupating, usually in the soil and not in the boll. The development of the pink bollworm is favored by moderate to high temperatures. However, above 37.5°C, the mortality rate starts to rise.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse fast-maturing varieties of cotton, as bollworm infestations occur rather late in the season.\\nMonitor cotton plants regularly for symptoms of the pest.\\nUse pheromone traps to assess populations.\\nPlan the winter and spring irrigation properly to reduce populations, through the flooding of the field, for example.\\nUse insecticides cautiously so as not to affect predators and avoid the development of resistance.\\nHarvest early to avoid peak populations of the insect.\\nDestroy plant residues immediately after harvesting.\\nLeave the soil as fallow during the summer months.\\nMaintain a 7 month period free of cotton plants in the field with crop rotation (small grains or alfalfa for example).'},\n",

They appear leathery and brittle compared to the leaves on healthy plants. Subsequent growth is characterized by smaller leaves, shorter internodes and smaller bolls. If the infection takes place at very early stage (e.g. as seedlings), the growth of the whole plant is stunted and compact. Roots appear hairy and dark brown (normally light yellow-brown color) and form small knots on the secondary root branches. Affected plants have a reduced number of bolls and ultimately lower yields.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBeneficial insects such as predatory ladybugs, lacewings, soldier beetles and parasitoid wasps are important agents to control populations of aphids. In case of mild infestation, use a simple soft insecticidal soap solution or solutions based on plant oils. Aphids are also very susceptible to fungal diseases when it is humid. A simple spray of water on affected plants can also remove them.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider a integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Insecticides containing cypermethrin or chlorpyrifos can be used as foliar spray against the aphids. Remember to change products between applications in order to avoid the development of resistance\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the cotton bunchy top virus, which can only survive in living plant tissues. It is transmitted in a non-persistent manner by the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii. There is usually a time-lag of 3-8 weeks from infection until the symptoms become obvious. Fields with high aphid populations are at highest risk. Volunteer plants, regrowth or ratoons that survived from the previous season can also be a problem since they act as both a preferred host for the aphids and a reservoir for the disease, creating a source of infection in the new season. It is thus not uncommon to see patches of infected plants around a ratoon. Disease transmission is favored by climatic conditions suitable for aphid reproduction, feeding and spread.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nDestroy crop debris thoroughly and remove ratoons and volunteers in the fields.\\nControl volunteer cotton plants on the farms and surroundings.\\nAvoid an excessive use of products against aphids as this will favor the development of resistance.\\nMonitor young cotton regularly for aphids and assess aphid spread within the field.\\nControl ant populations that protect aphids with sticky bands.'},\n",

It usually appears on the upper part of the plant. Purple streaks and small dark brown spots appear on stems and young leaves, sometimes forming concentric rings. As they coalesce, they cover large patches of the blade, eventually leading to necrosis of the tissues. Dark brown streaks may be visible on stems and petioles. Growing tips are usually severely affected with systemic necrosis. Plants show stunted growth or may exhibit one-sided growth. Severely infected plants bear immature tomatoes with mottled, light green rings and raised centers. On ripe, red fruits, striking brown rings accompanied by chlorotic spots and blotches makes fruits unmarketable.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nSome predatory mites feed on larvae or pupae of thrips and are commercially available. For varieties that attack the leaves and not the flowers, try neem oil or spinosad, especially on the undersides of the leaves. Spinosad application is very effective but can be toxic to certain natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, syrphid fly larvae, bees) and should be avoided during flowering time. In case of flower thrips infestation, some predatory mites or green lacewing larvae could be used. A combination of garlic extracts with some insecticides also seem to work well.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Due to the high reproductive rates and their life cycles, thrips have developed resistance to different classes of pesticides. Effective contact insecticides include azadirachtin or pyrethroids, which in many products are combined with piperonyl butoxide to enhance their effect.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nTomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is transmitted by various species of thrips, including the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) and the chili thrips (Scirtothrips dorsalis). TSWV is also active in the thrips vector and can transmit it persistently. Nymphs that acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants will retain the ability to transmit it for the remainder of their lives. However, TSWV cannot be passed from infected females to the eggs. The virus has a very wide host range, including tomato, pepper, potato, tobacco, lettuce, and many other plants.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse transplants from nurseries that have proper management for thrips and TSWV.\\nAvoid planting near alternative hosts or plants infected with the virus.\\nPlant resistant tomato varieties, as they do not require insecticide applications against thrips to control the dispersal of the virus.\\nInspect transplants thoroughly for the presence of thrips.\\nUse sticky traps over a large area for mass-catching.\\nControl weeds in and around the field by using highly reflective UV mulch (metalized mulch) to ward off the thrips.\\nRemove infected plants and any plant debris and destroy them.\\nKeep plants well irrigated, and avoid excessive applications of nitrogen fertilizer.\\nGreenhouses could be sterilized with steam between plantings.'},\n",

Affected ears are rounder than their healthy counterparts and are completely filled with black powdery masses. A tangled mass of vascular strands that are the remains of hard plant tissues mingles between spore masses. Infected plants usually have no silk or kernels on the ears. Excessive branching has been described as a secondary symptom.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBeetles that feed on the fungus (Phalacrus obscurus and Lystronychus coeruleus) can serve as biological control agents. Seed treatment with bacterial extracts of Bacillus megaterium could also decrease the incidence of the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available.

Milk is diluted with water (typically 1:10) and sprayed on susceptible plants at the first sign of infection, or as a preventative measure. Repeated weekly applications are needed to control or eliminate the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological measures if available. Seed treatment with difenoconazole, followed by flutriafol, triticonazole was used to protect wheat against this and other fungal diseases. Curative chemical control is possible with fungicides such as fenpropidin, feranimol, tebuconazole, cyproconazole and propiconazole. Another way to protect plants may be to treat them with a silicon- or calcium silicate-based solution that reinforce plant resistance to this pathogen.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the fungus Blumeria graminis, an obligate biotroph that can only grow and reproduce on a living host. If no hosts are available, it overwinters between seasons as dormant structures on plant debris in the field. Apart from the cereals, it can colonize dozens of other plants, that it may use to bridge two seasons. When conditions are favorable, it resumes growth and produces spores that are later scattered by wind to healthy plants. Once it lands on a leaf, the spore germinates and produce feeding structures that takes up nutrients from the host cells to support the growth of the fungus. Relatively cool and humid conditions (95% humidity) and cloudy weather favor its development. However, leaf moisture is not needed for the germination of the spores and can actually inhibit it. Ideal temperatures are between 16 °C and 21 °C with temperatures above 25 °C being detrimental. No known quarantine regulations exist for this pathogen because of its widespread distribution and airborne dissemination. Densely sowed plants, excessive application of nitrogen and monocultures also provide optimal conditions for the growth of powdery mildew.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose resistant varieties if available.\\nDo not sow too early in the season.\\nModify sowing density to allow for good aeration of cultures and reduce humidity.\\nMonitor field regularly for the first signs of the disease.\\nManage carefully the application of nitrogen, as its excess in soil favors the growth of the pathogen.\\nPlan a crop rotation with non-host plants.\\nEliminate volunteer plants and weeds from the field to disrupt its life cycle.\\nComplement the fertilization program with silicon or calcium silicate to strengthen the resistance of plants.'},\n",

Often, it causes normally dormant shoots to grow, producing small, yellow leaves, appearing in the shape of a \"witches’ broom\" on top of the plant. Slight swellings of lower stems may occur, as well as curling and the appearance of a mottled green and yellow pattern on the leaves. Roots may grow thin and woody, with thick outer layers, and deep cracks. Sometimes the cracks will form a ring around the root, hindering the transport of water and nutrients to the aerial parts of the plant and giving rise to the peculiar growth. .\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTreatment of cassava cuttings or seeds for six hours in 0.01 % Streptomycin solution before planting is an effective method in lowering mortality of cassava plants and increasing germination rate in the case of seeds. Some parasitic wasps have been used to control the populations of insect vectors.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. For cassava phytoplasma disease, there is no 100% effective chemical treatment available at the moment. Antibiotic treatments of cuttings and seeds increased root yield and starch content significantly and can be used to control the epidemics of the phytoplasma.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are triggered by bacteria-like organisms called phytoplasma that can only survive inside the vascular system of plants. They are mainly spread by the feeding habits of some insects that suck the sap of the cassava plants, among others mealybugs. Another important way of transmission is through the use or transport of infected plant material between fields or areas. This disease can be a serious threat to the cassava industry in many countries. Epidemics of phytoplasma disease have sometimes resulted in total yield losses when the disease has affected cassava plants early in their developmental stage. Quarantine measures to restrict the movement of infected plant material exist in some countries and can be further reinforced.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use disease-free planting material, obtained from certified sources.\\nPlant resistant varieties, if available in your area.\\nRegularly monitor the field for signs of the disease.\\nMaintain a high hygiene standard in the field and with agricultural tools and equipment.\\nDestroy infected plant individuals immediately by burning or burying them distant of the field.\\nDo not transport suspected infectious material to other fields or farms.\\nWarn the quarantine authorities if the symptoms appear on the fields.'},\n",

These compounds are extremely toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates and spray drift and runoff to surface waters should be avoided. Spray applications of pyrethroid products also target the adult bugs.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms commonly called \"cat-facing\" are caused by several species of bugs, among them the plant bug Lygus hesperus and the stink bugs Euschistus conspersus. Adults overwinter in protected ground covers. Early in the season, they feed on broadleaf crops or weeds in adjacent fields. Later in the summer, as these alternative hosts dry up, these bugs may fly into the canopy of pome and fruit trees. Adult plant bugs are flattened, semi-oval insects, yellow, green, and dark brown to black in color. The all have a conspicuous yellow or pale green triangle on the back.

During this first feeding period, they connect several buds together with silk threads, eventually forming a thick webbed shelter where they develop. The second generation of caterpillars cause more trouble since they feed on the berries growing around their shelter, leaving abundant frass. A single larva can feed on up to a dozen berries and thus may cause considerable damage. The injury is worsened by the secondary infection of the feeding sites by the gray mold, Botrytis cinerea. Adjacent berries, otherwise undamaged, may also become colonized and become brown and moldy. This moth is considered a very serious pest in many wine-producing areas in Europe and Asia.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nParasitic wasps like Trichogramma cacoecia and T. evanescens lay eggs into the eggs of this pest and can therefore significantly reduce grape bud moth infestations in vineyards. Make sure not to diminish the population of these natural enemies by the excessive use of broad-scale insecticides. Effective organic insecticides against E. ambiguella include products based on Spinosad and natural pyrethrin. The number of spray applications depends on the amount of infested berries.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Effective insecticides against E. ambiguella include pyrethroids. Where it is a recurrent problem, a post bloom insecticide application may be necessary, and a late summer application may be needed to control the second generation. The number of spray applications depends on the amount of infested berries. Temperature and humidity are the decisive factors to determine the emerge of the second generation of caterpillars.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the feeding activity of the caterpillars of the grape bud moth Eupoecilia ambiguella and the colonization of the damaged tissues by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. The adult moth has yellow-brown forewings, with a conspicuous dark brown band and gray, fringed hindwings. Females deposit eggs (up to 100 per female) singly on flower buds or bracts during late spring or on grape berries during mid summer. The larvae hatch after 8-12 days. They are brownish-yellow and up to 12 mm in length, with scattered hairs over the whole body. Overwintering occurs as a second generation pupa in cracks on the bark or other suitable places. The life cycle of the moth is highly dependent on temperature and humidity. It is usually found in cooler and humid areas, and has only two generations per year. The optimum relative humidity level for development is 70% or higher and temperature between 18 and 25°C. Eggs will fail to hatch at low relative humidity levels and temperatures.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCheck for quarantine regulations in your country and contact competent authorities in case of doubt.\\nRegularly monitor the grapevines for infested buds or berries.\\nUse pheromone traps to assess numbers.\\nSince the moth overwinters as pupae in leaf litter on the ground, remove and destroy grapevine debris to reduce emergence in spring.\\nAlternatively, covering leaf litter with compacted soil will prevent emergence.\\nBoth of these options must be completed three weeks prior to bloom.\\nIn light infestations, remove injured berries by hand.\\nDo not transport potentially infected material to other fields or farms.'},\n",

In the pre-emergence phase, the fungus colonizes the seeds just after sowing, causing seed rot and stopping germination. In the post-emergence phase, seedlings grow poorly and the base of the stem starts to rot. The stem is visible as soft and slimy with water-soaked, grey, brown or black lesions. Young plants or trees become chlorotic and start to wilt, eventually toppling down, appearing as if they have been cut off at the base. White or grey mold-like growth appears on dead plants or on the soil surface. When seedling loss is extensive, replanting may be necessary.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBiofungicides based on fungi Trichoderma viride, Beauveria bassiana or the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis can be used as seed treatment or applied around the root zone at the time of planting to prevent or control the pre-emergence form of damping off. In some cases, the preventive treatment of seeds with copper fungicides such as copper oxychloride or Bordeaux mixture help to reduce the incidence and severity of the disease. Homemade solutions based on plant extracts of Eupatorium cannabinum completely inhibit the growth of the fungus.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach, using both preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Preventive measures and careful conduct during field work are the best way to avoid the disease. In fields with histories of damping-off or problems with drainage consider using fungicides as preventive measure. Seed treatments with metalaxyl-M can be used to control the pre-emergence form of damping-off. Using foliar spray with captan 31.8% or metalaxyl-M 75% during cloudy weather may also help. The soil or the base of the plant can be drenched with copper oxychloride or captan every fortnight from the time of planting.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nDamping-off can affect several crops and is caused by fungi of the genus Pythium, which can survive for several years in soil or plant residues. They thrive when weather is warm and rainy, soils are excessively moist and plants are densely sown. Stressful conditions, such as water-logging or high nitrogen application, weaken the plants and also favor the development of the disease.

A rough dark ring and a yellow halo gives the spots the characteristic 'frog-eye' appearance. As the spots become more numerous, they gradually coalesce to form large leaf lesions. The white center often dries and falls out, leaving a ‘shot-hole’ effect. At later stages of the infection, leaves turn yellow and wilt or drop, exposing fruits to sunscald.

Grasshopper and locust feed primarily on leaves damaging the margins or cutting out large portions of the leaf. Grains, seed pods and fruits may also be attacked by the insect. When they are very hungry they might even feed on stems and bark. They also nibble at the shoots, hence severing the reproductive parts.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nBiological control agents which occur naturally such as wasps, parasitic flies and worms, ants, birds, frogs, web-spinning spiders should be promoted. Fungal pathogens and entomopathogenic fungus (Metarhizium acridum) could also be used to reduce the population density of larvae. Use home-made poison baits from salt water and rice bran.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach of preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Use foliar insecticidal sprays to control grasshoppers in fields that show >10% damage. Granules are not effective. Poisonous bait traps can be used to attract the adults. Insecticides that can be sprayed against the pest include chlorpyriphos, buprofezin or etofenprox. Other FAO recommended chemicals include bandiocarb 80% WP @ 125 g/ha, chlorpyriphos 50% EC @ 480 ml/ha, deltamethrin 2.8% EC @ 450 ml/ha.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe characteristic symptoms on leafs and panicles are caused by the nymphs and adults. Aquatic environments are suitable for their development (e.g. rice fields, floodplains, deltas). The grasshoppers range in sizes from 5 mm to 11 cm in length, and they could either be long and slender or short and stout. They can blend easily into their surroundings as they are either green or straw colored. Females lay yellow eggs on the foliage. The adults can develop wings, swarm and migrate.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nAt planting, monitor your plants and destroy egg pods and nymphs.\\nMonitor the field regularly for characteristic signs of the damage and the presence of grasshopper nymphs or adults.\\nPick adults directly from the foliage at night when they are sluggish.\\nIn case of affected rice fields flood the seedbed to drown the insect.\\nSweep small seedbeds with a net to catch the insect.\\nRemove weeds which might serve as alternative hosts.\\nAvoid frequent pesticide spray that could affect populations of beneficial insects.\\nDeep ploughing after harvest is recommended in winter season to expose the egg masses to predators.\\nTrenches of 45 cm deep and 30 cm wide may be dug across the front of marching hoppers and trenches should be provided with metal sheet barriers.'},\n",

They can appear on leaves, buds, blossoms, shoots or fruits and are usually characterized by the discoloration or localized necrosis of these tissues. Individual branches show delayed budbreak and leaf development and can show terminal dieback. Chlorotic or bright yellow blotching, chlorotic to yellow mottling, ringspots, lines and/or \"oak leaf\" patterns appear on developing leaves. In severe cases, the chlorotic areas become necrotic and fall out, resulting in shredding, deformation or \"shot-hole\" aspects. Fruit maturity may be delayed, and fruit may be marked, rendering them unmarketable.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nCombatting Stecklenberger disease is very difficult. Thermotheraphy of seeds with hot air (24-32 days at 38 °C) or hot water can ensure healthy stocks. The generation of new trees through a method called apical meristem culture (free of virus) has also been effective.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Viral diseases in general cannot be controlled by pesticides. As thrips may serve as a possible vector of disease spreading, their control may reduce infection cases.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nPNRSV causes necrotic ringspot in many species of Prunus, often with subsequent recovery from symptoms. The virus can be transmitted through plant propagation methods, making the spread of tree nursery stocks and root grafting in orchards problematic. The virus has also been shown to infect pollen and seeds and to be transmitted in this way to pollinated plants. Bees or other insects carrying infected pollen into orchards can thus serve as vectors. The virus can also be transmitted by thrips, however, the contribution and importance of thrips in its propagation is unknown. PNRSV infects all flower parts, therefore infection of seeds can occur from an infected pollen grain, an ovule, or both. It also seems that the virus can infect the fruits.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to use certified and thereby virus-free seeds.\\nUse virus-free wood as grafting support.\\nRegularly monitor the orchard for symptoms of the disease.\\nRemove diseased plant material immediately and bury or burn it.\\nAvoid usage of commercial bee-hives previously employed in other orchards.\\nMaintain a high standard of hygiene.\\nIt is recommended not to plant new trees near infected orchards.'},\n",

The grub is light yellow with a dark brown flat head, while the adult is light grey with numerous black tubercles at the base. Eggs are laid on either branches or the main stem under the bark, in oviposition slits, previously chewed out by the female. After 5-7 days the larvae hatch and bore downward in the trunk, creating tunnels to the surface and holes at regular intervals through which droppings (frass) are ejected. The larva is a creamy white legless grub, elongated and cylindrical in shape.

Later on, the leaf spots are visible on both leaf surfaces. The older spots merge and take on different characteristics, depending on their location on the leaf. They range from brown to steal-grey (on upper side) and light brown (lower side). If the infection is heavy, leaves become curly and can drop off.

Side shoots, leaf petioles and the lower side of the leaf may occasionally be infected. Leaves turn pale, wilt and shed, whereas severely attacked plants are stunted. Infestation in the field may show in patches around a cutting that was infested at planting. Heavy feeding by the nymphs causes the drying up and weakening of the stems, often causing them to break in the wind. The plant produces new shoots to compensate for the breakage of stems, leading to profuse branching and a bushy appearance of infected plants. Root development in those plants is poor, and the tubers become inedible. Symptoms are worse on plants previously weakened by insect attack and drought.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nA 60-minute immersion in liquid extract from cassava roots can kill A. albus before the cuttings are used for planting. Immersion in hot water can also be used but this is less effective. It has also been observed that the vertical storage of stems reduced the infestation. Some coccinellid predators, such as Chilocorus nigritus can also help to reduce the populations. An improvement of soil fertility through the use of organic fertilizers or the addition of organic matter can also help.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. As a preventive measure, the stems may be sprayed or dipped for 5 minutes in solutions of dimethoate, diazin, methyl demeton or malathion (0.01 to 0.05% depending on formulations) at the time of storing to prevent the infestation. Dipping cuttings in liquids containing malathion, diazinin or dimethoate before planting avoids cassava scale infection.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the scale insect Aonidomytilus albus. It feeds and survives on the plants and can be dispersed by wind or animal/human contact. The transport of infected plant material such as cuttings for replanting can also spread the disease over long distances. Females feed on the plants and lay eggs beneath the bud scales. The young nymphs hatch after few days and crawl to other plant parts, where they loose their legs and become sedentary. They feed on stem sap gregariously and dehydrate it.

The aphids have long piercing mouth-parts which they use to suck the sap on shoot tips and young leaves, leading to distortions of twigs and the curling, rolling or folding of leaves. As they feed on the sweet plant phloem, they excrete the excess sugar as honeydew. When it falls onto leaves, it is readily colonized by sooty mold fungi that make the leaves turn black. This limits photosynthesis and has consequences on the vigor of the tree and the quality of the fruits. The damage to citrus trees can also be due to the infection of the tristeza virus, which is carried by the aphids.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nPredators include many species of hoverflies, lacewings and ladybirds that can attack aphids at all stages of development. Two commonly used coccinellids against this pest are adults and larvae of Cycloneda sanguinea and Hippodamia convergens. Some culture-specific parasitic wasps may also be available for citrus in the area of interest. The fungus Neozygites fresensii can be an important check on aphid populations during humid weather.

Synthetic pyrethroids are also likely to be effective against aphids and ants, but can also have a negative impact on natural enemies.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the adults and nymphs of the black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii. They often co-infect citrus trees and other cultures together with another related species of aphid T. citricida, commonly known as brown citrus aphid. Adults exist in two forms, either with or without wings. Winged specimens can fly distances of up to 30 km and are found when they become too numerous or when food supply is limited. They have a dull brownish to black body with a length of about 1.5 mm. The black citrus aphid has a simple life cycle and a high reproduction rate that can lead to rapid and severe infestations. The temperature range for development, survival and reproduction varies between 9.4 and 30.4 °C. The honeydew attracts ants, which in turn protect the aphids from natural predators. They are considered a vector of the tristeza disease of citrus and the zucchini yellow mosaic virus.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose seeds from healthy plants or from certified sources.\\nIf possible, plant in an area free of this pest, and isolated geographically.\\nMonitor fields regularly to assess the incidence of a disease or pest and determine their severity.\\nHand-pick the aphids manually from the plant or remove infected plant parts.\\nCheck for weeds in and around the fields.\\nDo not over-water or over-fertilize.\\nControl ant populations that protect aphids with sticky bands or nets.\\nDo not transport citrus trees between different farms or areas.\\nControl the use of pesticides, as those can affect negatively the populations of beneficial insects.\\nPrune the branches of your trees or remove the bottom leaves of your plants to favor the ventilation of the canopy.'},\n",

       "  'data': \"Leaf-footed Bugs\\n\\nSymptoms\\nLeaf-footed bugs can cause a range of symptoms in crops, depending on the species of bug, the stage of development, and the type of plant being affected. Here are some common symptoms of leaf-footed bug damage in crops. Leaf-footed bugs can cause slowed growth in plants, particularly in young plants that are still developing. This can result in smaller yields or a delayed harvest. These bugs can cause discoloration and deformity in fruit. Affected fruit may appear discolored, misshapen, or have small sunken areas on the surface. This can make the fruit less marketable because of these visible damages. Leaf-footed bugs can cause damage to the leaves and stems of plants. This can result in yellowing or browning of the leaves, wilting, and even death of the plant. In addition, some species of leaf-footed bugs can transmit plant diseases, which can further damage crops and reduce yields.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nInsecticidal soap or botanicals, such as neem oil or pyrethrin, may provide some control of young nymphs only. One of the best ways to control leaf-footed bugs is to remove their eggs.\\nChemical Control\\nChemical control of leaf-footed bugs involves using insecticides to kill or repel the pests. There are several insecticides that are effective against leaf-footed bugs, including pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and spinosad. These insecticides can be applied as sprays, dusts, or baitst's important to follow the instructions on the label carefully when using insecticides. Be sure to wear protective clothing and gear, and avoid spraying when the weather is windy or rainy. Also, be sure to follow any restrictions on the label regarding the timing of the application and the number of times you can apply the product. While chemical control can be effective in reducing leaf-footed bug populations, it is important to note that overuse or misuse of insecticides can have negative impacts, including non-target insects, wildlife, and humans. Therefore, it's important to use insecticides judiciously and as part of an integrated pest management approach that includes cultural and biological controls.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nLeaf-footed bugs are insects that have flattened, leaf-shaped back legs.. They are medium-sized insects, usually about 20 mm long. They are usually brown or green, and they feed on the sap of plants, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The life cycle of a leaf-footed bug starts when the female lays eggs on plants. The eggs are about 1.4 mm long, oval-shaped, bronze to dark brown and are laid in rows. The eggs hatch into small nymphs, which look like smaller versions of the adult bugs. The nymphs go through several transformations before becoming adults. During each transformation, the nymph sheds its old skin and grows a new one. As they grow, they start to look more like adults, and they develop wings. Once the leaf-footed bugs become adults, they mate and lay eggs, and the cycle starts again. Leaf-footed bugs can go through several generations per year, depending on the climate and the availability of food. They are more likely to cause problems when it rains a lot. Adults come out of hiding in the spring after spending the winter under dead plants or mulch. If the winter is warm, more adult insects survive and can cause more problems. Some types of leaf-footed bugs only reproduce on weeds, while others reproduce on vegetables. Fruit damage is the main concern with these insects, and they are most likely to cause problems around the time that the fruits start to form.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nCheck your plants regularly for signs of leaf-footed bug activity, such as egg masses, discolored fruit, sunken areas on fruit, and damage to leaves and stems. You can use physical barriers, such as row covers or netting, to keep leaf-footed bugs away from your plants. Remove weeds from your fields because leaf-footed bugs can hide and feed on weeds. Keep your fields clean by removing fallen fruit or other debris that could attract leaf-footed bugs. Attract or introduce natural predators (birds, spiders, and predatory insects) that can help control leaf-footed bugs by providing shelter and water. Practice good field sanitation as the end of the season to reduce the chances of the insect to survive until the next season.\"},\n",

       "  'data': 'Stemphylium Blight of Lentil\\n\\nSymptoms\\nStemphylium blight initially appears as small, light beige spots on leaves or leaflets. These symptoms are very similar to those of botrytis blight. Eventually, these lesions coalesce to produce larger, irregularly shaped lesions that can engulf entire branches. Chlorotic to tan leaves are particularly conspicuous on the top of the canopy. Initially, stems remain green but as the disease progresses further, they eventually turn tan and then brown. At high relative humidities, diseased leaves take on a gray to black appearance. As they fall to the ground, they provide a new inoculum for future infections. Often, plants can be left with only terminal leaves in a question of days. From the distance, irregular brownish patches can be observed in the fields.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nAqueous extracts of Azadirachta indica (Neem) and Datura stramonium ( jimsonweed) can be used for the biocontrol of Stemphylium leaf blight disease with an efficacy close to that of conventional fungicides. Under greenhouse conditions, the preventive or curative application of products based on Trichoderma harzianum and Stachybotrys chartarum results in the reduction of disease incidence and severity (around 70% in both cases).\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. To be effective against Stemphylium blight of lentils, fungicides should be applied preventively in the last third of the growing season. Earlier treatments are bound to be ineffective. Solution of the active ingredients azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, boscalid + pyraclostrobin, chlorothalonil, iprodione, mancozeb and prochloraz could work well. Treatments should be done when conditions are unfavorable for the fungus (cool and dry weather). In general, the effectiveness of the fungicides was enhanced with an alternation of products.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nStemphylium blight of lentil is caused by the fungus Pleospora herbarum, formerly known as Stemphylium herbarum, thereby the name of the disease. It is thought to survive on seeds or infected dead plant debris in the field. Beside lentil, this fungus can infect a wide range of other bloadleaf plants. An extended period of leaf wetness late in the season is essential for the development of the disease. The incidence and severity of symptoms also depends on temperatures, with the range 22 -30°C being optimal. In these conditions, 8 to 12 hours of leaf moisture are enough to trigger infection. In suboptimal conditions, for example air temperatures of 15 to 20 °C, the length of the moisture period can increase substantially (24 hours or more). Older plants are more susceptible to develop the disease than younger ones, particularly when they are under nitrogen stress.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMake sure to select clean seeds, if possible from certified source.\\nSelect resistant varieties (several are available).\\nReduced plant density to have a good airflow.\\nEnsure a good field drainage before planting.\\nAvoid excessive nitrogen applications which can increase disease severity.\\nRemove and bury plant debris through tillagen after harvest.'},\n",

       "  'data': \"Fall Armyworm\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe larvae of the fall armyworm cause damage by feeding on all plant parts. Young larvae initially eat one side of the surface of the leaf tissue, leaving the opposite layer intact (window feeding). Seedlings can be fed upon up to the destruction of buds and growing points. Larger larvae leave a characteristic row of perforations and ragged margins on leaves, as well as lines of larval frass. They can also cut the base of the plant or attack the reproductive and young fruit. In the case of heavy infestation, fall armyworm larvae can cause extensive loss of leaves.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nWasp parasitoids include Cotesia marginiventris, Chelonus texanus and C. remus. The most common parasitoid fly is Archytas marmoratus. Predators include ground beetles, spined soldier bugs, flower bugs, birds or rodents. Bio-insecticides containing neem extracts, Bacillus Thuringiensis or Baculovirus Spodoptera, as well as Spinosad or Azadirachtin can be sprayed. In maize, red sand, rock salt, charcoal powder or fly ash put in the whorl deters the larvae from feeding and kill them (100 %, 98 %, 90 and 80 % efficacy, respectively).\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Recommended insecticides include esfenvalerate, chlorpyrifos and lambda-cyhalothrin. Farmers are also advised to go for poison bait based on these insecticides for adult larvae.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nEggs are laid in tight clusters of 100-300 on the undersides of the leaves, usually covered with scales. The larvae are light tan or green to nearly black, with stripes running along the flanks and a yellowish line along the back. The moth has white transparent hind wings and brown front wings mottled with lighter and darker marks. Each forewing has a noticeable whitish spot near the extreme tip. Diet and temperature determine the length of the different life cycle phases. Cool, wet springs followed by warm, humid weather favor the life cycle of the insect.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlant more resilient plants.\\nMonitor the moth's presence and mass-catch them with light or pheromone traps (10 traps/ha).\\nPlant early to avoid peak populations.\\nWeed control is recommended.\\nHarvest early to avoid consistent damage.\\nPlow the land to expose larvae and pupae to high temperatures.\"},\n",

       "  'data': 'Peach Twig Borer\\n\\nSymptoms\\nFirst signs of the presence of this pest in the orchards may be the wilting of leaves or the flagging of new shoots in the spring. This loss of vigor in leaves, shoots and is particularly conspicuous in young trees. Later in the year, the damage can also be observed on older shoots and on fruits. In the latter, it is usually characterized by holes at the stem end, at the contact zone between two fruits or where leaves touch the fruit. The larvae feed , boring shallow tunnels and surface grooves. In high population numbers, they can cause extensive damage to young trees or nursery stock. The type of damage is very similar to that inflicted by the larvae of the oriental fruit moth.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nAnarsia lineatella has about 30 known species of natural enemies. The parasitoid wasps Paralitomastix varicornis, Hyperteles lividus and Macrocentrus ancylivorus lay their eggs on the larvae of the peach twig borer, something that slowly kills them. Ants also happen to feed on the larvae. These natural enemies can reduce significantly the population of larvae, but often not below economically damaging levels. Therefore, timely applications of organically-approved oils, pyrethrin, spinosad or insecticides based on Bacillus thuringiensis can be used to supplement these treatments. The disruption of mating with sex pheromones can also be used as additional strategy.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. The preferred management strategy for peach twig borer is a timely treatment with insecticides during the 1) delayed dormant phase, 2) the bloom phase and the 3) post bloom phase. Formulations based on methoxyfenozide or diflubenzuron can be used in phase 1 and 2. The former, along with chlorantraniliprole can also be used in the post bloom phase. Other products are also available for these three type of treatments.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe damage is caused by the larvae of Anarsia lineatella, a major pest in several tree crops. Adult moths have a grayish to brown body and mottled or banded forewings. Females lay eggs on young shoots, fruit, and on the underside of leaves, next to the vein. Larvae are small and have a brown body with alternating white rings and a black head. They overwinter in shelters under the bark, crevices on old wood or in pruning wounds. During the bloom period they come to light again and migrate to twigs and branches, where they attack newly emerged leaves, blossoms and shoots. They burrow down the tender shoots, blocking the transport of water and nutrients, and causing them to wilt and die. They can also cause the destruction of the growing points in older shoots, causing the dieback of the branch and in some occasion lateral branching. The life cycle of this insect include 3 to 4 generations per year.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nExamine the orchards during spring to determine if the pest is in the orchards.\\nOpen shoot to see if the larva is inside.\\nUse pheromone traps to monitor the moths.\\nControl insecticide use in order not to affect beneficial insects.'},\n",

Leaves with chewed edges or irregular holes are characteristic for earwig feeding. This damage can be of little concern in mature, otherwise healthy trees. However, the feeding on young seedlings or tender shoot-tip on young trees may lead to stunted growth. Damaged seedlings may be missing all or parts of their leaves and stem. On soft fruits, earwigs cause shallow, irregular marks or holes on the surface that can extend deeply in the flesh. Their activity is also denoted by black dots of excrement around feeding sites. If you are unsure whether the damage is from earwigs, inspect the tree after sunset with a flashlight as earwigs are most active at night.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nFormulations containing spinosad can be applied on organically grown apricots. Trap earwigs with rolled-up newspapers or small tin cans filled with oil and set in the soil. Check traps in the morning and dispose of earwigs in soapy water.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Earwigs are beneficial where aphids are problematic and eliminating all earwigs with a chemical treatment could cause other pest populations to increase. Insecticides are recommended in severe csaes, and they should be applied on the trunk and base of trees at night to avoid a negative impact on bees. These treatments can be extremely toxic to aquatic invertebrates and runoff and spray drift to surface waters should be avoided. Limited to three in-season applications per year.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nAdult earwigs are about 0.5 inch long, shiny brown, and have a pair of forceps-like structures at the back end of the abdomen. They sometimes hibernate in pairs in the soil during the winter and emerge when conditions are favorable. Females lay eggs twice during the season, so that there can be two distinct nymph hatchings, one in the late spring and one in the early summer. They feed most actively at night and seek out dark, cool, moist places during the day. Fallen branches or fruits, boards and densely packed weeds provide shelter to this insect. In areas with particularly hot summers, earwigs may be relatively inactive. Their presence or damage may go unnoticed until harvest. As omnivores, they also feed on insects, particularly plant-feeding aphids. Earwigs are both pests and beneficial insects depending on where you find them.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nMonitor the orchard regularly for presence of earwigs.\\nRemove weeds from around the base of trees.\\nKeep orchard clear of pruned branches, suckers, loose bark, or debris under which earwigs could nest.\\nRemove tree parts that come in contact with soil to prevent access to trees.\\nUse a sticky tape around the base of the tree to prevent earwigs from climbing up to reach the fruit.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Cabbage Moth\\n\\nSymptoms\\nThe caterpillars of the cabbage moth start eating on the leaves and bore tunnels on the head of cabbage. As they chew on the lamina and avoid the rougher veins, the leaves are often skeletonized. In contrast to the first generation (spring to early summer), the more robust second generation (late summer to October) can chew on harder tissues and eats not only the leaves but also bore tunnels into the inner head of the cabbage. Traces of frass can be found around the holes and along the tunnels there. This makes the caterpillars of cabbage moth particularly damaging for the crops.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nParasitoid wasps of the Trichogramma species can be used to destroy the eggs of the moth. There is a diverse array of predators that include some predatory beetles, yellow jackets, green lacewing, spiders and birds that feed on the larvae. Products based on the naturally occurring bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and some viral preparations kill the caterpillars and are very effective when sprayed thoroughly on upper and lower leaf surfaces. These insecticides do not persist in the environment. Pathogenic nematodes may also work against the caterpillars and must be used when foliage is wet, for example during cool dull weather.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments, if available. Products based on the active ingredient pyrethrum, lambda-cyhalothrin or deltamethrin can be used against the caterpillars of this moth. Extracts of pyrethrum can be applied several times and up to one day before harvest. For lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin, a maximum of 2 applications is recommended and a seven-day harvest interval must be respected.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused mainly by the caterpillar of the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae). The mature larvae pupate and overwinter in the soil. Adults have brown forewings with blackish-brown transversal undulations alternating with clearer areas. Hindwings are light gray. A few weeks after emergence, females lay white spherical eggs in clusters on both surface of leaves. After hatching, the caterpillars start feeding on the leaf tissues, boring tunnels in the leaves and eventually the cabbage head. They are yellowish green or brownish green, with no obvious hair on their body. Cabbage moths produce two generations per year. In late spring, the first generation of moths hatches from the soil, and caterpillars can be found on infested plants. In late summer, the second generation appears.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse more resistant varieties, if available.\\nMonitor fields regularly for signs of the disease.\\nPick off the white spherical moth eggs and caterpillars when seen.\\nGrow your Brassica crops under a fine netting that prevents females from laying eggs.\\nPlant early to avoid population peaks during the initial development of the head.\\nIntercrop with non-susceptible hosts.\\nStimulate populations of natural enemies through a controlled use of pesticides.\\nUse pheromone traps to attract and mass-catch the moths.\\nAvoid planting susceptible plants near the cabbage fields.\\nRemove weeds as they can serve as alternative hosts.\\nPlow the field after harvest to expose the pupae to predators and cold temperatures.'},\n",

They feed on the margins and tips of the leaves, removing large sections of leaf tissue, gradually progressing toward the midrib. Larvae are rolling down the leaf tips onto the leaf blade or folding two edges of the same leaf or two adjacent leaves, tying them with silken threads. This protective chamber allows them to rest during the day and avoid predators. They are very voracious and a few large larvae can cause considerable defoliation, with removal of leaf tissues and veins and sometimes leaving only the midrib.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nParasites and predators can control the population density of rice skippers in the field. Small parasitoid wasps target the eggs of the rice skippers whereas bigger wasps and tachinid flies parasitize the larvae. Predators include reduviid bugs, earwigs and orb-web spiders (Araneidae), which feed on the adults during flight. The use of sticks to hit the rice foliage and dislodge the larvae (which then drown) is also useful.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chemical control against P. mathias is usually not necessary, as it is considered a minor pest in rice. If natural enemies and cultural practices are unable to control a severe infestation of P. mathias, drain the water of the paddy and use sprays of chlorpyriphos.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nRice skippers are found in all rice environments but they are more abundant in rainfed rice fields. They are light brown with orange markings and have a characteristic pattern of white spots on the wings. The adults are diurnal and they have erratic flight movement as they skip from plant to plant, thereby their name. Females lay white or pale yellow, spherical eggs. The larvae are nocturnal. They are green with reddish vertical bands at each lateral side of the head, about 50 mm in size. The pupae are light brown or light green, and have pointed ends. Their development is favored by extreme weather events such as droughts, heavy rains or floods. The misuse of pesticides kills beneficial insects and may also be a cause of their appearance.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse resistant varieties, if available.\\nSow rice plants early in the season, to ensure vital and strong plants when populations of Pelopidas mathias appear.\\nSow densely to hinder the insect to enter the canopy.\\nMonitor the field regularly for symptoms of the insect.\\nCollect by hand the larvae and drown them, for example.\\nMake sure to promote beneficial parasitic or predatory species by avoiding the overuse of broad-spectrum pesticides.\\nMaintain proper fertilization to increase the rice plants' natural resistance to feeding damage.\"},\n",

Bio-fertilizers based on competitive strains of bacteria can increase both yield and the quality of the tuber.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chemical treatment of potato scab is difficult, because it often causes plant injuries. Seed treatments with fluazinam, chlorothalonil and mancozeb showed the lowest percentage of infection.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSymptoms are caused by the bacterium Streptomyces scabies, which survives in infected root tissue in the soil. It is spread through water, on infected plant material, and in wind-blown soil. It enters the plant tissues and the tuber mainly through wounds and natural openings. Dry and warm weather during the period of tuber growth increases the infection risk. Since the bacteria need large amounts of oxygen, the probability of infection is higher in loose and well-ventilated soils. The bacteria are most prevalent in dry and alkaline soils.

In older cabbage plants, new shoots are produced and the attacked plants produce several small heads of little commercial value. Caterpillar feeding after heading may cause stunting. They spin a silken tube while feeding. Plants will wilt, and frass is exuded from the affected plant parts. Infested plants frequently have several small clusters of leaves which is caused by damage to the central bud and the development of side shoots.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nIntroduce parasitic wasps such as braconid, ichneumonid and chalcidoid wasps. Bacillus thurigiensis is recommended and should be applied before larvae are protected by their silken webs, and before they have moved into the center of cabbages. Weekly applications of neem can also be effective.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. The use of insecticides to protect your plants from this pest is difficult as they are protected either by webbing or them burrowing into the crops. Use Acephate and permethrin at 8-10 day intervals. Carbamates and organo-phosphates controlled the moth when applied at first pest appearance on plants.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are a result of the feeding activities of young caterpillars of Hellula undalis in crops of the Brassica family (cabbage, cauliflower), foremost in the tropics and subtropics. Eggs are oval and are laid singly or in groups, sometimes in chains. The eggs are hatched after about three days, and after five developmental stages, they are mature with greyish-yellow and pinkish longitudinal stripes. Caterpillars are creamy white with light pinkish brown stripes along the body and have a black head. Mature caterpillars have faint stripes. At the final stage, caterpillars are 12-15 mm long, feeding from silken cocoons. Forewings are usually greyish-brown with wavy lines and a black spot. Adult moths are greyish-brown in colour, small and rather delicate. The wingspan is up to 18 mm. After emergence and mating, the females lay up to 150 eggs or more over the next 3 to 10 days. The adult moth is capable of flying long distances.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nUse clean planting materials and transplant only healthy, vigourous insect-free seedlings.\\nPlant trap crops, such as mustard (Brassica juncea) or Chinese cabbage (Bok Choy) between the rows of your brassica crop.\\nThe first row of trap crops should be planted about 15 days before transplanting your crop, while the second row follows 25 days after transplanting.\\nPractice regular monitoring of young plants in the nursery and after transplant.\\nKeep your field free from weeds.\\nInspect crops for the presence of caterpillars and damage symptoms.\\nPractice field sanitation, uproot and burn cabbage and kale stalks.\\nCrop rotation is important to reduce pest populations.'},\n",

Shallow entries points are visible on the fruit skin and correspond to aborted entries, where the larvae died or gave up and tried another place. In case of successful entry, the larvae penetrate into the flesh of the fruit and can reach the core to feed on seeds. The entry holes are surrounded by a red ring and capped with reddish-brown, crumbly larval droppings called frass. When the fruit is cut open, the small white caterpillar can sometimes be found near the core. Damaged fruits tend to ripen and drop early or are simply unmarketable. If left uncontrolled, larvae can cause substantial damage, often infesting 20 to 90% of the fruits, depending on the variety and location. Deep entries can be a severe problem in stored fruit because they are colonized by bacteria and fungi that lead them to rot. Late maturing varieties are more likely to suffer severe damage than early varieties.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nCodling moth granulosis virus (CYD-X) can be applied in weekly intervals, starting when moths or fruit stings have been first observed.

Adults are active only a few hours before and after sunset, and they mate when sunset temperatures exceed 16°C. The first generation of moths hatches in spring or early summer, just before bloom. One or two weeks after they start flying, the moths lay eggs on the fruits, usually one per fruit. Small larvae hatch from these eggs and chew on the skin, boring an opening into the fruits. It takes three to five weeks for the caterpillar to develop completely. Mature larvae drop off the fruits and find a place to hide, e.g. in cracks in the trunk. The second generation hatches in late summer or early autumn.

They also appear on the stems and heads,however to a lesser extent. Tiny black fruiting bodies within the lesions give them a characteristic speckled appearance. Later, entire leaves may be engulfed by large, brown rusty lesions and only some islands of green tissue remain, surrounded by a yellow halo. Finally, the leaves dry and die. In the absence of the black fruiting bodies, similar blotching symptoms may be caused by another disease or nutritional disorders such as aluminum toxicity or zinc deficiency.

Fungi belonging to group Trichoderma and some species of pseudomonads and bacillus have been shown to protect wheat plants against leaf spot diseases or to hinder the progression of the disease.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Many populations of M. graminicola have rapidly evolved resistance to fungicides, especially to the strobilurin class of chemicals. The economic threshold depends on expected yield loss, the market value of the wheat and the costs of the fungicide application. Fungicides of the group of the azoles are commonly used as folliar sprays. Alternating fungicides such as carboxamide or benzophenone helps mitigating the development of resistance.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe disease is caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola.

       "  'data': 'Black Mould\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSeeds rot without germinating and if germination occurs, the collar region gets rotten with water-soaked lesions. Damaged plant areas will also show water-soaked lesions. The symptoms vary depending on the affected crop. In onions, seedlings rot at the collar region during the early germination period. The sooty mould grows along the veins of the fleshy bulb tissue. In Peanuts, the fungus causes collar or crown rot, characterized by root curling and deformation of the upper part of the plant. In vines, early symptoms include pinhead drops of reddish sap at the infection site. Post-harvest decay results in discolouration, quality deterioration, and reduction in the commercial value of various crops.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nDrench soil with Trichoderma (enriched in FYM). Neem cake has anti-fungal properties and can also be used to control the spread of A. niger. Treat seeds with hot water at 60°C for 60 minutes before transplanting them. Onion varieties with red scale leaves due to the presence of Phenolic compounds have anti-fungal properties.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. If fungicides are needed, use localized drenching of mancozeb or a combination of Mancozeb and Carbendazine, alternatively Thiram. Other common treatments include Triazole and Echinocandin antifungals.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nBlack mould is a common fungus that appears on a variety of starchy fruits and vegetables. This results in food spoilage and deterioration. The fungus Aspergillus niger is spread by air, soil and water. It is generally a saprophyte, living off dead and decaying matter but can also live on healthy plants. The fungus is a common soil inhabitant in Mediterranean, tropical and sub tropical regions. The optimal growth temperature is 20-40°C with good growth at 37°C. Also, in the process of fruit drying, moisture content decreases and sugar content increases which results in a favourable medium for xerotolerant moulds of the fungus.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nChoose land with good drainage.\\nEnsure that the seed is free from spores and transplants are healthy.\\nUse resistant varieties, such as onion varieties with red scale leaves.\\nDo not harvest crops during wet weather.\\nMaintain stable temperatures and low humidity during transport, as well as when bulbs are going into and coming out of storage.\\nAfter harvest, collect and burn all the debris from the harvest.\\nCarefully dry bulbs after harvest and before storage and marketing.\\nIn hot climates, make sure that the humidity is below 80%.\\nUse a 2-3 year rotation between successive crops of susceptible crops and its relatives on the same land.'},\n",

First symptoms appear around flowering stage in the form of minute, brick-red specks on the underside of leaves, often along the veins. Later, these spots increase in size and number and become reddish brown or black. As the disease progresses, they become covered by raised, pale-brown fungal pustules visible to the naked eye. Some of them coalesce and form irregular dark brown spots surrounded by a yellowish halo. They are now present on both sides of the leaf, occasionally also on the petioles and stems. Premature defoliation of plants is possible.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nApply products containing essential oils of Corymbia citriodoria at 1 %, Cymbopogon nardus at 0,5%, and Thymus vulgaris at 0,3 % to reduce the severity of the infection.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatment if available. Selecting the right fungicide and applying it at the right time is crucial. Apply fungicides based on hexaconazole (2 ml/l of water) and propiconazole (1 ml/l of water). Apply formulations of zinc iron-maneb complex periodically throughout the growing season.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nSoybean rust is an aggressive disease caused by the fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi. It is not seed borne and needs green living tissue to live and complete its life cycle. When there are no soybean plants around, it needs an alternative host to survive. The spores produced in the pustules fly from plant to plant and penetrate the plant cells directly, rather than through pores or wounds in the leaf tissue. The development of the disease is favored by 6 to 12 hours of continuous leaf wetness, cool to moderate temperature (16 to 28°C) and high humidity (>75%).\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nSelect tolerant or resistant varieties.\\nPlant early and if possible choose an early maturing cultivar.\\nAlternatively, plant late to take advantage of drier periods.\\nUse wider row spacing to hasten canopy drying.\\nMonitor your plants regularly and weed out alternative hosts.\\nAdjust soil fertility, particularly potassium and phosphorus levels.'},\n",

       "  'data': \"Peach Leaf Curl\\n\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms usually appear soon after a leaf burst. Leaves become thickened and severely distorted with a puckered, crumpled or curled limb and a reddish to purple discolouration, depending on the variety of tree. As the infection progresses, the affected leaves take on a whitish-grey, powdery appearance due to the development of a fungal bloom on their surface. The grey covering gradually turns black, a process that coincides with higher daytime temperatures. Eventually, the diseased leaves die and fall, leading to defoliation and loss of vigour. They are soon replaced by new leaves emerging from the same growing point. Areas of bark or whole shoots can also be blackened when the infection becomes systemic, during which the fungus will start to spread within the plant's internal tissues. In those cases, growing tips produce abnormal lateral shooting and the development of witch's brooms. On heavily diseased trees, the surface of fruits shows a dramatic change in appearance.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nFungicidal sprays containing organic copper compounds like the Bordeaux mixture can be used to effectively combat this fungus. The first treatment should be done after the fall in the autumn season and again in spring before the buds start to swell. Note that repeated use of copper products can result in a buildup of copper in the soil, which eventually can become toxic to soil organisms.\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments, if available. Fungicides containing copper oxychloride, cupric hydroxide, thiram, ziram, chlorothalonil or difenoconazole can be used. The first treatment should be done after the fall in the autumn season and again in spring before the buds start to swell.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe symptoms are caused by the colonization of the plant tissues by the fungus Taphrina deformans. Spores produced on the leaf surface are washed by rain splashes or blown by the wind onto peach twigs and buds, initiating new infections. The spores germinate during frequent rains as the buds open in the spring and infect the still unfolded leaves. From the moment the spore enters the leaf bud, there is no effective countermeasure to stop the infectious process. If rain does not occur at this time, the spores remain inactive and little or no infection occurs. Lodged in bud scales or crevices in the bark throughout the summer and following winter, they eventually germinate during the next season. The fungus is only active at temperatures up to 16°C and can only reproduce at these low temperatures. Taphrina deformans infects peaches and nectarines, also almonds and occasionally apricots and ornamental Prunus.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nProtect the plants from rain or overhead irrigation during the bud swelling phase.\\nPrune the tree crown every year to allow for proper ventilation of the foliage.\\nUse moderate amounts of fertilizer.\\nUse plant fortifiers before bud swelling.\\nPlant resilient varieties, for example, white flesh varieties.\\nRemove and destroy all obviously infected leaves, mummified fruits and shoots.\\nWhenever possible, use a rain shelter of plastic to prevent infection.\"},\n",

       "  'data': 'Blight of Sunflower\\n\\nSymptoms\\nBrown spots may be found on leaves, petioles, stem, sepals, and petals of the host plant. The fungus causes seedling blight and head rot disease. On the leaves, the lesions are dark-brown with a paler margin and a yellow halo. At the disease progresses, the size gets increased to about 2-3 cm diameter and eventually coalesce to produce an irregularly shaped lesion, causing blighting and withering of leaves. These will be surrounded by chlorotic zone with the grey-white necrotic center. Spots first appear on the lower leaves and subsequently spreads to middle and upper leaves. On the stems, lesions occur as circular, elongated or striated black spots. On the sepals and petals, the spots are similar to those on the leaves but are smaller (0.5-2 cm diameter) and coalesce. The consequences of infection are blight and defoliation, destruction of the flowers and seed-heads, wilting, cracking of the stem and ultimately death of the plant. Sometimes rotting of flower heads also occurs.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nTo enhance the self-cleaning capacity of soils after harvesting the precursor in autumn, it is recommended to apply biological products based on Trichoderma spp. or biological control agents of phytopathogens (Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp.).\\nChemical Control\\nAlways consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments, if available. For planting, use seeds treated with fungicides containing thiram, fludioxonil, iprodione (contact fungicides), imazalil, tebuconazole, and flutriafol (systemic fungicides). During the vegetation period, use of formulations containing famoxadon (contact fungicide), cymoxanil (locally systemic fungicide), boscalid, propiconazole, and tebuconazole (systemic fungicide) can control the disease.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nIt is caused by fungus Alternaria helianthi. The pathogen survives on seeds and plant residues. The plants are susceptible to infection from the emergence stage to harvesting. The disease extensively spreads under warm, dry weather conditions with periodic rain. Excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers intensifies plant damage.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nPlan crop rotation of 3-4 years.\\nApply lime in acidic soils.\\nPlough deep with a single-furrow plough to ensure good drainage of soil and removal of plant debris.\\nInter-row tillage eliminates soil crust and improves soil aeration.\\nEnsure balanced nutrient levels with phosphorus and potassium fertilizers.\\nCropping during late season can decrease the disease incidence.\\nUse available disease-resistant varieties.'},\n",

       "  'data': 'Grapevine Phylloxera\\n\\nSymptoms\\nDaktulosphaira vitifoliae has two galling-producing stages; a leaf galling stage and a root galling stage. Small galls develop on the lower surface of the leaf. The size of the galls is about the size of half a pea. Sometimes, the entire leaf can be covered by galls. Leaf galling does not normally cause significant losses in grape production. However, severe infestations do cause considerable distortion and dropping of affected leaves late in the season. Leaf-galling forms of phylloxera are rarely present in some countries. Note that leaf inhabiting forms do not occur without the root form also present. On the other hand, the infestation of the roots can be difficult to control and can lead to root swelling and the decline of vines. Degradation of the root system can cause secondary fungal infections. Severe root infestations can cause defoliation and reduce shoot growth. Death of susceptible vines may result within 3 - 10 years. Usually, symptoms are less significant on vigorous vines over 10 years old.\\n\\nProduct Recommendations\\nOrganic Control\\nLittle information on the biological control of grape phylloxera is available; environmental and root conditions are more important than natural enemies.\\nChemical Control\\nTreating phylloxera with chemical tools is not always possible. On very sensitive cultivars, especially on young plants, it is necessary to treat as soon as the first galls develop in the spring. As soon as the galls appear, they must be opened daily by cutting them with a razor blade to detect when the eggs begin to hatch. Apply chemical control as soon as the small larvae are noticeable. Surveillance and early treatment application should be ensured so as not to reach the point of multiple generations with different life cycles co-existing. Insecticides have very little effect on these cases. Always use products regulated in your area.\\n\\nWhat caused it?\\nThe life cycle of Daktulosphaira vitifoliae is complex. This pest prefers heavy clay soils and dry conditions. In spring, the female hatches from a fertilized egg that had been laid on the wood of a grapevine, and migrate to a leaf where she produces a gall. Within 15 days, the female reaches maturity, fills the gall with eggs and dies soon afterwards. Nymphs that hatch from these eggs escape from the gall, and wander to new leaves. They produce new galls and eggs. During summer, there may be 6 or 7 generations. In the fall, nymphs migrate to the roots where they hibernate through the winter. The following spring they become active again and produce the root galls. Wingless females may cycle indefinitely on the roots year after year. In late summer and fall, some of the roots inhabiting phylloxera lay eggs that develop into winged females. Winged females migrate from the roots to the stems where they lay eggs of two sizes, the smaller ones developing into males and the larger ones into females. Mating occurs and the female then lays a single fertilized egg that overwinters on the grape stem. It is this egg that gives rise to leaf inhabiting generations. Depending on geographical factors, generations with different life cycles may develop at the same time.\\n\\nPreventive Measures \\nResistant rootstocks (American rootstocks) have been the main and most successful control measure for many decades.\\nAll Vitis vinifera varieties and French hybrid cultivars are susceptible to injury from the root gall insect and it is.\\nIn general, rootstocks with no vinifera parentage have retained their resistance remarkably.\\nIn the past, flooding vineyards for several weeks was classically used.'}}"
