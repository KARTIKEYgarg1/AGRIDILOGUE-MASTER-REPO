Olive Lace Bug

Symptoms
Yellow mottling (speckled discoloration) of the leaf surface which turns brown and eventually drops. Damage causes severe defoliation of crop and reduces fruit yield.

Organic Control
On a small scale, biological control can be successful. Lace bugs are reported to have an egg parasite but this is unlikely to be present in many conventional olive groves, particularly if the ground is bare (egg parasites are usually nectar feeders). Green Lacewing is the most common predator used for successful control.
Chemical Control
Lace bugs are easy to kill if there is good spray coverage when applying chemical treatments. Natural pyrethrum (pyrethrin) and synthetic pyrethrum (pyrethroids) are effective in controlling lace bug of olive. Potassium salts of fatty acids, also knows as soap salts, are reported to control the insect. Some organophosphates can be used in a production level. Repeat a second spray to control newly hatched nymphs after 10-14 days. When using a pesticide, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, and pre-harvest interval. Always follow local regulations of pesticide application.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by Froggattia olivinia. It is common to spot different stages of the insect clustered on the down side of the damages leaves. Eggs that have over-wintered on the tree usually begin to hatch out in spring or late winter. Adults can fly short distances. Feeding of the immature and adult insects causes yellow mottling to the leaves surface. The olive lace bug can have numerous generations per year depending on the climate. New infestations can occur regularly throughout the growing season. All motile stages have piercing and sucking mouthparts, thus all stages cause damage.

Preventive Measures 
Monitor the trees in early spring for evidence of insect infestation.
Apply control measures as soon as bug activity is notice.
Lace bug populations can build up rapidly if left unchecked.
Prune badly infested trees to facilitate control methods.
Pruning will also help rejuvenate badly damaged trees.
Regular monitoring of the pest is required on a fortnightly basis throughout the growing season, especially after a first infestation on the same season.
Pay close attention along the edge of the grove as population may move.
