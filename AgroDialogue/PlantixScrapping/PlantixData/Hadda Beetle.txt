Hadda Beetle

Symptoms
Both adults and larvae feed on the leaves and can cause severe damage. Initial symptoms form as the feeding damage to the green tissue between the leaf veins. Later, a characteristic damage pattern called skeletonization occurs whereby only the hard parts of the leaves (main veins and petioles) are left. There may be shallow holes on fruit surfaces, too. They destroy the seedlings and stunt the growth of more mature plants. The pest can lead to heavy defoliation and high yield loss and is, therefore, one of the most dangerous eggplant pests.

Organic Control
Parasitoid wasps of the Pediobius family can be used to control the pest. These wasps also attack beneficial ladybirds, so it is crucial to identify the pest carefully before using them. The pathogenic microorganism can also help to control the population of leaf-eating beetle. Biopesticides containing the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis or the fungus Aspergillus spp. can be used as foliar spray applications. Leaf extracts of Ricinus communis (castor oil), Calotropis procera, and Datura innoxia can be foliar sprayed. Applying ash can effectively reduce the infestation in the early stages.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and available biological treatments. Insecticides containing products, such as fenvalerate, and chlorpyriphos can be applied to the foliage, if needed.

What caused it?
The adults are oval, dull orange with 28 black spots and short soft hairs on the back. The female beetle lays oval, yellow eggs (0.4-1 mm) upright and in small groups usually on the lower side of the leaves. After about 4 days, the pale yellow-whitish larvae with long, dark-tipped split spines on the backs hatch. The larvae grow to about 6 mm within about 18 days, depending on temperature. They then move to the underside of the leaves and pupate. After an additional 4 days, the new generation of adult beetles emerges from the cocoons. During the reproduction period (March-October), cooler temperatures favour lifecycle and population growth. The beetles can overwinter in the soil and piles of dry leaves.

Preventive Measures 
Plant resistant varieties that are available in your area.
Avoid planting eggplant in or next to infested fields.
Remove or avoid planting alternative hosts in the vicinity of your field.
Irrigate thoroughly to keep your plant healthy.
Check your plants or field for any sign of the pest.
Handpick and destroy larvae and adults found in the seedbeds or fields.
Remove or destroy the infected plants and plant residues by burning them.
