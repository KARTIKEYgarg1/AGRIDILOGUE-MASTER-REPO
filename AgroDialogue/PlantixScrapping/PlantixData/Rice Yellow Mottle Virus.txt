Rice Yellow Mottle Virus

Symptoms
Younger leaves are mottled with yellow to green spots. After infection (2 weeks) these spots elongate parallel to the leaf veins. In the center of the yellow streaks, dark patches develop. Older leaves show yellow or orange discoloration. The growth of the plants can be stunted and the yield is reduced.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Destroy infected plants and plow under infected plant residues or better burn them.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. There is no direct chemical treatment to control the virus.

What caused it?
The virus is transmitted by several species of beetles or grasshoppers as well as cows, rats and donkeys. It is also transmitted through inter-plant movement of sap e.g. via irrigation water or contact between infected and healthy plants and undestroyed/plowed crop residues.

Preventive Measures 
Plant more resistant varieties if available.
Plant early to avoid peaks populations of this insect.
Remove weeds in and around the field.
Control insecticides in order not to affect beneficial insects.
Plow under infected plant residues or better burn them.
Alternatively, destroy infected plants after harvest.
