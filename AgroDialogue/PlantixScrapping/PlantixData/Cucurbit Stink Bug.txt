Cucurbit Stink Bug

Symptoms
Stink bugs, both young and adults, can cause problems for crops by sucking plant juice. Depending where they feed they cause yellowing of leaves and small sunken areas on stems and fruit. The overall growth of the plants is affected negatively. Yields are reduced. When stink bugs are in big numbers they can be a big threat to the growth of small plants and new, delicate growth.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
The bug has natural enemies but the strong smell it emits is a strong defense against predators. Spray products of essential oil mixtures with natural pyrethrins or spray neem oil. Have in mind the same principles as in the chemical control section. Combine this spray method with scouting your crops for symptoms and removing any bugs and eggs.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with more environment friendly treatments. In case of big infestation spray with contact pesticides that are regulated for this use in your area. Spray in the morning, when adults are active, and direct the sprays towards the roots and also the underside of leaves. In case you use leaf mulch, spray water on your leaf mulch to force the bugs out of the hiding places and spray on top of them.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by the stink bug Coridius janus. This bug is mainly found in cucurbit plants. The bugs overwinter as adults in plant debris and between weeds. Each female can lay up to 100 eggs on the underside of the leaves, stems or other parts of host plants. The adult does not fly and has a black head, with an orange body and black wings. The bugs like to hide in leaf mulch. They are active in the morning and in the evening, but during the day, they take shelter under the leaves.

Preventive Measures 
Avoid using leaf mulching around cucurbits during the growing season as it gives the squash bugs a place to hide.
Scout through your field as a lot of damage can be avoided if you spot and mechanically remove the bugs and the eggs.
Pay attention to the parts of the field you have seen stink bug damage in the previous years.
Once you spot adults, young stages or eggs, remove them with your hands and crush them.
Always wear gloves as stink bugs have a bad smell after crushing them.
Keep your field clean of all plant debris that can act as overwintering hiding places.
Till your soil well after harvest.
