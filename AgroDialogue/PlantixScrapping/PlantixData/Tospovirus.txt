Tospovirus

Symptoms
Chlorotic or necrotic local lesions, concentric ringspots, line patterns, and green island mosaic occur on the plant leaves. There is stem discolouration, followed by systemic symptoms such as wilting, stunting, mottling, crinkling, bronzing, distortion (curling), chlorosis and (top) necrosis, which may vary on the same host species. Fruits show irregular discolouration, such as yellow or orange flecks with occasional necrotic rings.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Introduce thrip predators such as Amblyseius cucumeris, Hypoaspis miles, and Orius insidiosus. Cultural control methods, such as crop isolation, reflective mulches, netting, or other means can be employed to diminish the vector population.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures along with available biological treatments.

What caused it?
Damage is caused by Tospoviruses and is transmitted by thrips in a persistent and propagative manner. Larval thrips feed on virus-infected plants and only thrips that acquire the virus as larvae will be able to transmit the virus. Factors such as plant species and cultivar, the developmental stage at the time of inoculation, and the nutritional and environmental conditions can influence the symptom expression on the plant.

Preventive Measures 
Control thrip population.
To more directly manage the virus, planting disease-free seedlings where possible, minimizing the presence of weeds and volunteer crop plants within fields, and rouging within the crop are recommended in many circumstances.
