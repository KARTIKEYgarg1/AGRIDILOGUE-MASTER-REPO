Anthracnose of Olive

Symptoms
First symptoms appear as concentric rings with circular sunken lesions. In moist conditions, soft to dark brown fruit rot occurs. In dry conditions, fruit dehydrates and mummifies. In both cases, fruits fall prematurely. These symptoms mostly become visible when fruits ripen.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Some endophytic strains of Aureobasidium pullulans have been shown to provide high protection levels against Colletotrichum spp. when applied at the pre-flowering and berry-ripening stages.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Apply one or two sprays with fungicides such as strobilurins, mancozeb or copper-based fungicides, one before flowering and one in the early fruit set. Two applications may be necessary if infection is left after the previous spray. Apply after pruning to ensure the cuts and tissues left behind on the tree prevent reinfection.

What caused it?
The fungus Glomerella cingulata can be dormant in plant tissue, and then becomes activated under very moist or dry environmental conditions. warm and humid weather conditions favor the development of Glomerella cingulata, especially during the flowering stage and pre-harvest. The pathogen survives on mummified fruits, leaves that remained on the tree or infected woody tissue.

Preventive Measures 
Select tolerant or resistant varieties.
Ensure planting material in new olive groves are disease-free.
Maximize air flow and sunlight infiltration in the canopy.
Provide adequate fertilization with fairly ow nitrogen content.
Avoid over watering your trees.
Monitor and identify early infections.
Clean and disinfect pruning equipment.
Prune affected plants to prevent further spread.
Remove and destroy infected fruits and pruned materials.
