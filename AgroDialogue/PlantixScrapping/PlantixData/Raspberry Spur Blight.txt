Symptoms
Blue to violet spots appear on the shoots and the bark bursts open. Subsequently, the spore cushions form blisters on the shoots. The plant drops its leaves early in the year. In spring the affected shoots do not sprout.

Product Recommendations

Chemical Control
Fungicides based on Lime Sulfur or Captan/Fenhexamid mixtures can be used.
