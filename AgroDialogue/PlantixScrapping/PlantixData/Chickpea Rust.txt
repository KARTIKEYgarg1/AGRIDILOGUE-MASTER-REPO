Organic Control
To this day we are not aware of any biological control method available against this disease. Please get in touch with us in case you know of something that might help to fight this disease.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Control with fungicides has shown little success. Chickpea Rust is a minor disease and in most cases does not demand severe control measures.

What caused it?
The symptoms are caused by the fungus Uromyces ciceri-arietini. Rust on chickpeas is favoured by cool and moist weather conditions. Rain is not essential for a development of the Rust. The disease mainly occurs later in the growing season, after the flowering stage.

Preventive Measures 
Plant resistant varieties, such as NRC34, NEC249, JM583, JM2649, HPC63, HPC136, and HPC147, which have shown resistance to the disease under natural field conditions.
Sow early to avoid the peak of the disease outbreak.
Monitor your field regularly.
Remove affected plant parts and crop residues.
Avoid late irrigation.
