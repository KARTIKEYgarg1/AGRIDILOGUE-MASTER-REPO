Alfalfa Mosaic Virus

Symptoms
Bright yellow mottle or mosaic blotches develop on the leaves, leading to bronze discolouration. Necrotic rings and spots develop on the fruit. Phloem tissue, including the phloem in the roots, becomes necrotic resulting in plant death.

Product Recommendations
Organic Control
Use silver reflective mulches to delay the infection by aphid-borne viruses and reduce the incidence and severity of these diseases by repelling aphids that transmit them. Place reflective polyethylene mulches on planting beds before seeding or transplanting to reduce aphid landing and virus transmission.
Chemical Control
Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and available biological treatments. No effective chemical control strategies are currently available. Insecticides aimed at controlling the aphid vectors are ineffective.

What caused it?
The damage is caused by the seed-borne virus, which survives in infected seed or plant hosts. Secondary transmission can occur when aphids spread the virus from the seeds of infected plants to healthy plants in a non-persistent manner. Once an aphid acquires the virus, it retains the ability to transmit the virus for only a short period and the spread is rapid and localized.

Preventive Measures 
Use healthy seeds and sow early at optimal seeding rates.
Avoid planting tomatoes near infected alfalfa fields.
Avoid the use of insectary plantings that contain alfalfa near tomato fields.
Practice proper weed management.
