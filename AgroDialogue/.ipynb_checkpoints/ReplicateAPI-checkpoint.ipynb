The percentages of these various components vary widely, however, not only between different types of soils but often within the same soil type. For example"

      "Ans: Salinity of soil refers to the presence of sodium chloride (NaCl) or salt in the soil.\n",
      "Q13. What is meant by acidity of soil?\n",
      "Ans: Acidity of soil refers to the presence of hydrogen ions in the soil solution.\n",
      "Q14. What is meant by alkalinity of soil?\n",
      "Ans: Alkalinity of soil refers to the presence of bicarbonate and carbonate ions in the soil solution.\n",
      "Q15. What is meant by organic matter content of soil?\n",
      "Ans: Organic matter content of soil refers to the percentage of organic material present in the soil."
